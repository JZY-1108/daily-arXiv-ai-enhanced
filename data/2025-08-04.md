*Oshayer Siddique,J. M Areeb Uzair Alam,Md Jobayer Rahman Rafy,Syed Rifat Raiyan,Hasan Mahmud,Md Kamrul Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估前沿大型语言模型（LLM）在解决物理问题（数学和描述性）上的表现，并采用多代理框架和推理技术提升性能，同时引入新评估基准PHYSICSEVAL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理问题是自然语言推理的重要领域，研究LLM在此领域的表现有助于推动技术发展和理解模型能力。

Method: 使用多代理框架和推理技术验证模型解决方案，并比较不同技术的性能表现。

Result: 多代理框架显著提升了模型在初始表现较差问题上的性能，并引入包含19,609个物理问题的新基准PHYSICSEVAL。

Conclusion: 研究表明多代理框架能有效提升LLM解决物理问题的能力，新基准为未来研究提供了标准化评估工具。

Abstract: The discipline of physics stands as a cornerstone of human intellect, driving
the evolution of technology and deepening our understanding of the fundamental
principles of the cosmos. Contemporary literature includes some works centered
on the task of solving physics problems - a crucial domain of natural language
reasoning. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of frontier LLMs in
solving physics problems, both mathematical and descriptive. We also employ a
plethora of inference-time techniques and agentic frameworks to improve the
performance of the models. This includes the verification of proposed solutions
in a cumulative fashion by other, smaller LLM agents, and we perform a
comparative analysis of the performance that the techniques entail. There are
significant improvements when the multi-agent framework is applied to problems
that the models initially perform poorly on. Furthermore, we introduce a new
evaluation benchmark for physics problems, ${\rm P{\small HYSICS}E{\small
VAL}}$, consisting of 19,609 problems sourced from various physics textbooks
and their corresponding correct solutions scraped from physics forums and
educational websites. Our code and data are publicly available at

### [2] [Do LLMs produce texts with "human-like" lexical diversity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00086)
*Kelly Kendro,Jeffrey Maloney,Scott Jarvis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上与人类写作存在显著差异，尤其是较新的ChatGPT模型（如-4.5）差异更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上是否与人类写作相似。

Method: 比较四种ChatGPT模型与240名L1和L2英语参与者的文本，测量六个词汇多样性维度。

Result: LLM文本与人类文本在词汇多样性上差异显著，ChatGPT-4.5词汇多样性更高但更不接近人类写作。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本在词汇多样性上不接近人类写作，新模型更不接近，对语言教学有启示。

Abstract: The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains
unclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has
received. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of
lexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical
diversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,
and -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n
= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were
measured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,
disparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and
Support Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed
significantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini
and -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated
higher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human
writers' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,
language status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce
human-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce
less human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these
results for language pedagogy and related applications.

### [3] [Semiotic Complexity and Its Epistemological Implications for Modeling Culture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00095)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文呼吁计算人文学科中方法的理论化，以提升领域的成熟度，并提出将建模工作视为文化语言域与计算数学域之间的翻译过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算人文学科需要更多方法理论化，以确保内部一致性、避免翻译错误并促进解释透明性。

Method: 将建模工作框架化为翻译过程，引入‘符号复杂性’概念，分析当前建模实践中的翻译错误。

Result: 指出主流建模实践（尤其是评估方面）将符号复杂数据简化为符号简单数据的错误，并提出改进建议。

Conclusion: 研究者应更好地处理符号复杂性，以避免翻译错误并提升建模的透明性和准确性。

Abstract: Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for
epistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the
field. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation
work from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical
domain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of
their translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --
to ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation
errors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this
paper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of
theorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling
practices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic
complexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across
interpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --
especially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating
semiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems
epistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out
several recommendations for researchers to better account for these
epistemological issues in their own work.

### [4] [FACTORY: A Challenging Human-Verified Prompt Set for Long-Form Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00109)
*Mingda Chen,Yang Li,Xilun Chen,Adina Williams,Gargi Ghosh,Scott Yih*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTORY是一个大规模、人工验证的提示集，用于评估模型生成准确、全面回答的能力，结果显示现有模型在FACTORY上的表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估基准缺乏人工验证，可能导致质量问题，因此需要更可靠的评估工具。

Method: 采用模型在环方法开发FACTORY，并通过人工验证其提示集，随后对6个先进语言模型进行评估。

Result: 约40%的SOTA模型回答在FACTORY上不准确，而其他数据集仅为10%。

Conclusion: FACTORY是一个更具挑战性和可靠性的基准，突显了模型在长尾事实推理上的不足。

Abstract: Long-form factuality evaluation assesses the ability of models to generate
accurate, comprehensive responses to short prompts. Existing benchmarks often
lack human verification, leading to potential quality issues. To address this
limitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.
Developed using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY
includes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and
unambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models
using FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a
challenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of
SOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our
analysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing
its reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed
facts.

### [5] [Is neural semantic parsing good at ellipsis resolution, or isn't it?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00121)
*Xiao Zhang,Johan bos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经语义解析器在处理上下文敏感现象（如英语动词短语省略）时的表现，发现尽管在标准测试集上表现优异，但在省略现象上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语义解析器在强上下文敏感现象（如动词短语省略）中的表现，验证其是否能够处理复杂的语义信息重复问题。

Method: 构建了一个包含120个省略案例及其完整语义表示的语料库，作为挑战集测试多种神经语义解析器。

Result: 解析器在标准测试集上表现良好（语义匹配分数超过90%），但在省略案例中表现失败。

Conclusion: 神经语义解析器在处理上下文敏感现象（如省略）时存在局限性，数据增强可能是一种改进方向。

Abstract: Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of
linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But
how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where
large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful
semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a
construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary
verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with
ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with
their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set
for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers
performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with
ellipsis. Data augmentation

### [6] [Comparison of Large Language Models for Deployment Requirements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00185)
*Alper Yaman,Jannik Schwab,Christof Nitsche,Abhirup Sinha,Marco Huber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展现状，提供了开源基础模型和领域特定模型的对比列表，帮助研究者和企业选择适合的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，模型数量激增，研究者和企业在选择模型时面临挑战，尤其是在许可和硬件需求方面。本文旨在提供一个清晰的比较工具。

Method: 通过整理和比较开源基础模型及领域特定模型的特征（如发布年份、许可和硬件需求），创建了一个持续更新的列表。

Result: 提供了一个公开的、持续更新的模型对比列表，发布在GitLab上。

Conclusion: 本文的工具为LLM选择提供了实用参考，解决了模型快速演变带来的选择难题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) are revolutionizing the generation of human-like text, producing
contextually relevant and syntactically correct content. Despite challenges
like biases and hallucinations, these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models excel
in tasks, such as content creation, translation, and code generation.
Fine-tuning and novel architectures, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), address
these issues. Over the past two years, numerous open-source foundational and
fine-tuned models have been introduced, complicating the selection of the
optimal LLM for researchers and companies regarding licensing and hardware
requirements. To navigate the rapidly evolving LLM landscape and facilitate LLM
selection, we present a comparative list of foundational and domain-specific
models, focusing on features, such as release year, licensing, and hardware
requirements. This list is published on GitLab and will be continuously
updated.

### [7] [Tabular Data Understanding with LLMs: A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00217)
*Xiaofeng Wu,Alan Ritter,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了表格在LLMs和MLLMs中的重要性，提出了表格输入表示的分类法，并指出了当前研究的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格因其复杂和灵活的结构在LLMs和MLLMs中受到关注，但缺乏通用方法，需要系统化研究。

Method: 通过分类法总结表格输入表示，并介绍表格理解任务。

Result: 指出当前研究的三大不足：任务偏重检索、模型处理复杂表格能力有限、模型泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决表格理解中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

### [8] [Semantic Compression for Word and Sentence Embeddings using Discrete Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00220)
*Rana Aref Salama,Abdou Youssef,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了离散小波变换（DWT）在词和句子嵌入中的应用，展示了其在多分辨率分析和压缩嵌入表示中的能力，同时保持语义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小波变换在信号和图像处理中表现优异，但其在自然语言处理（NLP）中的应用潜力尚未充分挖掘。本文旨在验证DWT在分析、压缩嵌入表示中的有效性。

Method: 通过实证研究，将DWT应用于词和句子嵌入，评估其在语义相似性任务中的表现，并测试不同嵌入模型（包括大语言模型）在下游任务中的效果。

Result: DWT能将嵌入维度减少50-93%，且在语义相似性任务中性能几乎不变，多数下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: DWT为改进NLP应用提供了新途径，尤其在嵌入表示的高效压缩和语义信息保留方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in
different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate
patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from
data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms
can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic
properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase
the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different
levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall
quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity
tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information
in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using
different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream
tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by
50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks,
while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave
the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.

### [9] [Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00238)
*Bryce Anderson,Riley Galpin,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）对人类语言使用的影响，发现ChatGPT发布后，人类口语中与LLM相关的词汇使用显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解LLM是否正在改变人类语言系统本身，而不仅仅是作为工具生成文本。

Method: 通过分析2022年前后的2200万单词口语数据集，比较LLM相关词汇的使用趋势。

Result: 结果显示，2022年后LLM相关词汇使用显著增加，表明人类语言选择与LLM模式趋同。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这种变化可能是自然语言演变或AI驱动的新现象，同时引发了对模型与社会道德信念对齐的伦理关注。

Abstract: In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has
undergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed
to the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target
audience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are
often linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to
generate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a
dataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from
conversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends
before and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated
words. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of
these words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and
LLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no
significant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of
words affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language
use. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by
AI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem
from broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training
misalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These
findings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

### [10] [Integrating clinical reasoning into large language model-based diagnosis through etiology-aware attention steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00285)
*Peixian Li,Yu Tian,Ruiqi Tu,Chengkai Wu,Jingjing Ren,Jingsong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种病因感知注意力引导框架，通过结合结构化临床推理提升大语言模型在复杂临床场景中的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在医学文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在复杂临床诊断中的可靠性仍有限。研究旨在提升其诊断准确性和临床推理能力。

Method: 构建临床推理支架（CRS），开发病因感知头识别算法，并通过推理引导的参数高效微调将病因推理线索嵌入输入表示。

Result: 在一致性诊断队列中，诊断准确性平均提升15.65%，推理聚焦分数提升31.6%。外部验证进一步证实其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将模型注意力与结构化CRS对齐，为构建更可解释和可靠的AI诊断系统提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities
in medical text understanding and generation. However, their diagnostic
reliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to
enhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We
propose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured
clinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct
Clinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines
for three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute
pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head
Identification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's
etiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we
introduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds
etiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected
Etiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided
Loss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework
improves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning
Focus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant
Diagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy. Further assessments via Reasoning Attention Frequency indicate that
our models exhibit enhanced reliability when faced with real-world complex
scenarios. Conclusion: This study presents a practical and effective approach
to enhance clinical reasoning in LLM-based diagnosis. By aligning model
attention with structured CRS, the proposed framework offers a promising
paradigm for building more interpretable and reliable AI diagnostic systems in
complex clinical settings.

### [11] [Systematic Evaluation of Optimization Techniques for Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00305)
*Ammar Ahmed,Sheng Di,Franck Cappello,Zirui Liu,Jingoo Han,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型（LLM）的优化技术（如剪枝、量化和令牌丢弃）在长上下文场景下的效果，揭示了组合优化对大型模型的负面影响，并提供了平衡效率、准确性和可扩展性的实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其资源需求和有限上下文窗口限制了应用。现有优化技术在长上下文场景和系统评估中的效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 本文首先分析两种支持长上下文的LLM架构的单独优化方法，然后系统评估这些技术的组合效果，并在70B参数模型上研究其可扩展性。

Result: 研究发现，组合优化算法可能因累积近似误差对大型模型产生负面影响，而仅依赖F1分数会掩盖问答任务中的精度-召回权衡。

Conclusion: 通过结合系统级分析和任务特定洞察，本研究为LLM实践者和研究人员提供了平衡效率、准确性和可扩展性的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing
tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although
techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these
issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains
underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations,
characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these
methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual
optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then
systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this
deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the
scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70
billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination
inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to
compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts.
Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding
precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating
system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM
practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

### [12] [Improving Multimodal Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Object-Phrase Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00332)
*Kaiyan Zhao,Zhongtao Miao,Yoshimasa Tsuruoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCSEO通过细粒度对象-短语对齐提升多模态句子嵌入，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态句子嵌入模型训练中，图像-标题对常含冗余或无关信息，影响效果。

Method: 利用分割和对象检测模型提取对象-短语对，优化对比学习目标。

Result: 在STS任务中，MCSEO表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 细粒度对象-短语对齐对多模态表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal sentence embedding models typically leverage image-caption pairs
in addition to textual data during training. However, such pairs often contain
noise, including redundant or irrelevant information on either the image or
caption side. To mitigate this issue, we propose MCSEO, a method that enhances
multimodal sentence embeddings by incorporating fine-grained object-phrase
alignment alongside traditional image-caption alignment. Specifically, MCSEO
utilizes existing segmentation and object detection models to extract accurate
object-phrase pairs, which are then used to optimize a contrastive learning
objective tailored to object-phrase correspondence. Experimental results on
semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks across different backbone models
demonstrate that MCSEO consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting
the significance of precise object-phrase alignment in multimodal
representation learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AdaPlan的自适应全局规划代理范式，结合了PilotRL训练框架，通过强化学习优化LLM代理的长期决策能力，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂任务中表现受限，尤其是长期规划和执行协调不足，且依赖监督微调导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出AdaPlan范式，结合PilotRL框架，通过渐进式强化学习优化全局规划和执行协调。

Result: 实验显示PilotRL性能优越，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL超越GPT-4o 3.60%，比GPT-4o-mini提升55.78%。

Conclusion: AdaPlan和PilotRL有效解决了LLM代理在长期规划和执行协调中的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling
agent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges
when deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent
paradigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate
action execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring
long-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner
and executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in
agent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion
trajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted
with novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an
adaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize
high-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon
decision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward
PilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by
progressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to
follow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.
Subsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of
generated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning
and execution coordination. Experiments indicate that PilotRL could achieve
state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + PilotRL surpassing
closed-sourced GPT-4o by 3.60%, while showing a more substantial gain of 55.78%
comparing to GPT-4o-mini at a comparable parameter scale.

*Alan Dao,Dinh Bach Vu,Alex Nguyen,Norapat Buppodom*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小语言模型（SLM）通过动态任务向量机器和强化学习优化，在知识密集型任务中表现接近大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型因容量有限在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，需通过动态推理机制提升性能。

Method: 提出动态任务向量机器，将模型内部推理视为动态任务向量构造过程，并通过RLVR优化。

Result: Lucy（1.7B参数SLM）在SimpleQA基准测试中达到78.3%准确率，媲美大模型。

Conclusion: 小模型通过结构化、自构造的任务推理机制可匹敌大模型。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are inherently limited in knowledge-intensive
tasks due to their constrained capacity. While test-time computation offers a
path to enhanced performance, most approaches treat reasoning as a fixed or
heuristic process. In this work, we propose a new paradigm: viewing the model's
internal reasoning, delimited by <think> and </think> tags, as a dynamic task
vector machine. Rather than treating the content inside these tags as a mere
trace of thought, we interpret the generation process itself as a mechanism
through which the model \textbf{constructs and refines its own task vectors} on
the fly. We developed a method to optimize this dynamic task vector machine
through RLVR and successfully trained an agentic web-search model. We present
Lucy, a 1.7B-parameter SLM that leverages this dynamic reasoning mechanism with
MCP integration to achieve 78.3% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark, performing
on par with much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3. This demonstrates that
small models can rival large ones when equipped with structured,
self-constructed task reasoning.

### [15] [EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level Efficiency for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00370)
*Jiyu Chen,Poh Seng Lim,Shuang Peng,Daxiong Luo,JungHau Foo,Yap Deep,Timothy Lee Jun Jie,Kelvin Teh Kae Wen,Fan Yang,Danyu Feng,Hao-Yun Chen,Peng-Wen Chen,Fangyuan Li,Xiaoxin Chen,Wong Wai Mun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EdgeInfinite-Instruct通过分段监督微调和量化优化，解决了Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署时的计算和内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限的边缘设备上部署大型语言模型面临计算复杂性和内存需求高的挑战，现有方法在降低首次生成时间（TTFT）和保持性能方面不足。

Method: 提出Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning（S-SFT）策略，结合细粒度后训练量化和固定形状计算图优化。

Result: 在长上下文基准测试和实际移动任务中，EdgeInfinite-Instruct在保持效率的同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: EdgeInfinite-Instruct为边缘设备上的长序列任务提供了高效且性能优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging
due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value
(KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory
efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may
degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling
architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full
retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient
solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality
while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT.
However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks
mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose
EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning
(S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and
question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient
deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization
(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by
implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and
on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and
cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks
show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining
efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuangliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中演示无效的原因，提出了一种基于梯度流的演示选择方法GradS，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设ICL中的演示总是有效，但实际并非如此，因此探究演示无效的原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过梯度流和线性自注意力模型分析演示无效的原因，并提出GradS方法，利用梯度流幅度选择有效演示。

Result: 实验验证了演示有效性随模型层数增加而分化的现象，GradS方法在多个数据集上平均提升6.8%。

Conclusion: GradS通过梯度流选择演示，显著提升了ICL性能，为演示选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context
learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,
existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations
provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations
are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.
Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration
ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear
self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a
demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by
the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is
amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective
ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus
on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the
model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which
leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of
the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as
the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We
validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream
datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness
among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating
our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on
average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SA-GCS的新型训练框架，结合课程学习与强化学习，通过动态调整样本难度提升无人机视觉语言导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在无人机视觉语言导航任务中存在数据利用效率低、收敛慢及未充分考虑样本难度差异的问题，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SA-GCS框架，包含语义感知难度估计器（SA-DE）和高斯课程调度器（GCS），动态调整训练样本分布，实现从易到难的渐进学习。

Result: 在CityNav基准测试中，SA-GCS在所有指标上均优于基线方法，收敛更快且更稳定，且在不同规模模型上泛化良好。

Conclusion: SA-GCS通过系统整合课程学习与强化学习，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable
agents to accurately localize targets and plan flight paths in complex
environments based on natural language instructions, with broad applications in
intelligent inspection, disaster rescue, and urban monitoring. Recent progress
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has provided strong semantic understanding for
this task, while reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising
post-training strategy to further improve generalization. However, existing RL
methods often suffer from inefficient use of training data, slow convergence,
and insufficient consideration of the difficulty variation among training
samples, which limits further performance improvement. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Semantic-Aware Gaussian Curriculum Scheduling
(SA-GCS)}, a novel training framework that systematically integrates Curriculum
Learning (CL) into RL. SA-GCS employs a Semantic-Aware Difficulty Estimator
(SA-DE) to quantify the complexity of training samples and a Gaussian
Curriculum Scheduler (GCS) to dynamically adjust the sampling distribution,
enabling a smooth progression from easy to challenging tasks. This design
significantly improves training efficiency, accelerates convergence, and
enhances overall model performance. Extensive experiments on the CityNav
benchmark demonstrate that SA-GCS consistently outperforms strong baselines
across all metrics, achieves faster and more stable convergence, and
generalizes well across models of different scales, highlighting its robustness
and scalability. The implementation of our approach is publicly available.

Conclusion: 小波变换在NLP中具有潜力，提出的方法能有效压缩信息并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Wavelets have emerged as a cutting edge technology in a number of fields.
Concrete results of their application in Image and Signal processing suggest
that wavelets can be effectively applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tasks that capture a variety of linguistic properties. In this paper, we
leverage the power of applying Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and
sentence embeddings. We first evaluate, intrinsically and extrinsically, how
wavelets can effectively be used to consolidate important information in a word
vector while reducing its dimensionality. We further combine DWT with Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) to propose a non-parameterized model that compresses a
sentence with a dense amount of information in a fixed size vector based on
locally varying word features. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm on
downstream applications models yielding comparable and even superior (in some
tasks) results to original embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN的固定聚合机制无法处理节点信息不平衡问题，且忽略了全局语义关系，限制了模型性能。

Method: ReaGAN框架中，每个节点作为代理自主决策，结合内部记忆和检索增强生成技术，实现自适应消息传播和全局关系构建。

Result: ReaGAN在少样本上下文设置中表现出色，无需微调即可利用冻结的LLM骨干网络实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ReaGAN展示了代理规划和局部-全局检索在图学习中的潜力，为GNN提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based
learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined
aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key
limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness --
some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second,
predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity
while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the
model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose
Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework
that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node
acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal
memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation.
Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access
semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph.
ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings
using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of
agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Result: 在七个对话评估基准测试中表现优于现有基线，证明了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持多评委多样性的同时显著降低了评估成本，适用于快速灵活的对话质量评估。

Abstract: Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)
remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the
``LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator
to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various
biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation
results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as
judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although
effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead
during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue
evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by
aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach
preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically
reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality
assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise
comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its
efficiency and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统无法处理半真半假陈述（事实正确但误导性），因为它们未考虑遗漏的关键上下文。

Method: 提出了PolitiFact-Hidden基准数据集和TRACER框架，通过证据对齐、意图推断和隐藏内容因果分析来检测遗漏性虚假信息。

Result: TRACER显著提升了半真半假分类的F1分数（最高16分），并在多个基线模型上表现优异。

Conclusion: 建模遗漏信息对可信事实核查至关重要，TRACER可整合到现有系统中以提升性能。

Abstract: Fact verification systems typically assess whether a claim is supported by
retrieved evidence, assuming that truthfulness depends solely on what is
stated. However, many real-world claims are half-truths, factually correct yet
misleading due to the omission of critical context. Existing models struggle
with such cases, as they are not designed to reason about what is left unsaid.
We introduce the task of half-truth detection, and propose PolitiFact-Hidden, a
new benchmark with 15k political claims annotated with sentence-level evidence
alignment and inferred claim intent. To address this challenge, we present
TRACER, a modular re-assessment framework that identifies omission-based
misinformation by aligning evidence, inferring implied intent, and estimating
the causal impact of hidden content. TRACER can be integrated into existing
fact-checking pipelines and consistently improves performance across multiple
strong baselines. Notably, it boosts Half-True classification F1 by up to 16
points, highlighting the importance of modeling omissions for trustworthy fact
verification.

Motivation: 探索LoRA的表达能力与泛化能力之间的关联，并填补现有方法在平坦最小值与泛化关系研究上的空白。

Method: 提出Flat-LoRA和EFlat-LoRA，理论证明全参数空间的扰动可转移到低秩子空间，避免多矩阵干扰。

Result: EFlat-LoRA在GLUE和视觉语言模型上表现优于LoRA和全微调，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: LoRA的泛化能力与平坦性密切相关，EFlat-LoRA在效率和性能上均表现优异。

Abstract: Little research explores the correlation between the expressive ability and
generalization ability of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Sharpness-Aware
Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat
minima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not
been fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically
seek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose
Flat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for
LoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full
parameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach
eliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across
multiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large
language models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves
optimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining
comparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with
RoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and
0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat
shows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,
respectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of
LoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本交流中，韵律特征（如音高、节奏和语调）缺失，表情符号作为视觉替代品传递情感和语用信息。研究旨在填补表情符号与韵律之间直接关联的实证空白。

Method: 通过结构化的开放式生产和感知任务，收集并分析真实的人类语音数据。

Result: 说话者会根据表情符号调整韵律，听者能通过韵律变化识别表情符号，且语义差异较大的表情符号对应更显著的韵律差异。

Conclusion: 表情符号可作为韵律意图的有意义载体，揭示了其在数字媒介中的交际作用。

Abstract: Prosodic features such as pitch, timing, and intonation are central to spoken
communication, conveying emotion, intent, and discourse structure. In
text-based settings, where these cues are absent, emojis act as visual
surrogates that add affective and pragmatic nuance. This study examines how
emojis influence prosodic realisation in speech and how listeners interpret
prosodic cues to recover emoji meanings. Unlike previous work, we directly link
prosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through
structured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides
empirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.
Results show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners
can often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and
greater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic
divergence. These findings suggest that emojis can act as meaningful carriers
of prosodic intent, offering insight into their communicative role in digitally
mediated contexts.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型训练耗时且计算资源密集，即使是小型模型也需要多GPU和数天时间。本文旨在探索快速训练和评估解码器-Transformer语言模型的方法。

Method: 引入PaPaformer架构，通过并行训练低维路径并组合成大模型，支持不同数据类型训练和任务定制。

Result: 该方法减少了模型参数和训练时间，同时提高了性能，并支持任务定制化。

Conclusion: PaPaformer为高效训练语言模型提供了新思路，具有减少资源消耗和提升灵活性的潜力。

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount
of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language
models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often
requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate
decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks.
We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture
variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model.
The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually
with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model.
This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and
the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel
path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to
accommodate specific task requirements.

Motivation: 现有连续思维链（CCoT）方法存在间接微调、对齐不足或目标不一致的问题，限制了其效率和性能。

Method: 提出SynAdapt框架，生成合成CCoT作为精确对齐目标，并引入难度分类器动态调整推理策略。

Result: 在多种难度基准测试中，SynAdapt实现了最佳的准确性与效率平衡。

Conclusion: SynAdapt通过合成CCoT和动态推理策略，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves model performance, it incurs
significant time costs due to the generation of discrete CoT tokens (DCoT).
Continuous CoT (CCoT) offers a more efficient alternative, but existing CCoT
methods are hampered by indirect fine-tuning, limited alignment, or
inconsistent targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textit{SynAdapt}, an innovative efficient reasoning framework. Specifically,
\textit{SynAdapt} generates the synthetic CCoT to serve as a precise and
effective alignment target for LLMs. This synthetic CCoT explicitly guides the
LLM to learn CCoT and derive accurate answers directly. Furthermore, relying
solely on CCoT is insufficient for solving hard questions. To address this,
\textit{SynAdapt} integrates a difficulty classifier that leverages both
question context and CCoT to identify hard questions. CCoT can effectively help
identify hard questions after some brief reasoning. We then adaptively prompt
the LLM to re-think these hard questions for improved performance. Extensive
experimental results across various benchmarks from different difficulty levels
strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving the best
accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Motivation: 现有LLM置信度估计方法忽略上下文相关性，CRUX填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CRUX框架，结合上下文熵减和一致性检验两种新指标。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现最佳，AUROC最高。

Conclusion: CRUX显著提升LLM置信度估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language
models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust
outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications.
Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between
responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality
evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided.
To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and
Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context
faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics.
First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the
information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second,
unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through
the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context.
Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two
domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness,
achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语因其形态复杂性和资源匮乏，主题建模研究不足，需要新的方法提升效果。

Method: 使用GCN生成语义丰富的文档嵌入，再通过NMF分解得到主题表示，并与多种传统和现代方法对比。

Result: GHTM在主题一致性和多样性上优于其他模型，并引入新的孟加拉语数据集NCTBText。

Conclusion: GHTM为孟加拉语主题建模提供了有效解决方案，并丰富了数据集资源。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that is used
to identify latent themes and extract topics from text corpora by grouping
similar documents based on their most significant keywords. Although widely
researched in English, topic modeling remains understudied in Bengali due to
its morphological complexity, lack of adequate resources and initiatives. In
this contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called
GHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input
vectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce
semantically rich embeddings. The embeddings are then decomposed using
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to get the topical representations of
the underlying themes of the text corpus. This study compares the proposed
model against a wide range of Bengali topic modeling techniques, from
traditional methods such as LDA, LSA, and NMF to contemporary frameworks such
as BERTopic and Top2Vec on three Bengali datasets. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by outperforming other
models in topic coherence and diversity. In addition, we introduce a novel
Bengali dataset called "NCTBText" sourced from Bengali textbook materials to
enrich and diversify the predominantly newspaper-centric Bengali corpora.

Abstract: This is the third in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate two commonly held
prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI
model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and
threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025,
8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a
claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on
GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024).
  We demonstrate two things:
  - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on
benchmark performance.
  - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question
level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting
approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question.
  Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be
as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However,
as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield
significantly different results for individual questions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIG文本检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，尤其是在少样本/单样本生成文本上缺乏研究，因此需要构建更具挑战性的数据集和改进检测方法。

Method: 引入DACTYL数据集，包含少样本/单样本生成文本及领域特定CPT模型生成文本。使用BCE和DXO两种优化方法训练分类器。

Result: 现有检测器在DACTYL数据集上表现差，DXO分类器在分布外文本上优于BCE分类器。

Conclusion: DXO方法具有更好的泛化能力，AIG文本检测器需进一步改进以应对少样本和领域特定文本。

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings
despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust
enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these
detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on
zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot
generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we
introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models
(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on
one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific
continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all
parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG
text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential
vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our
own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)
optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While
BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL
test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学推理领域的发展，提出了训练时和测试时的增强技术分类，并分析了其在多模态数据和临床应用中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医学中展现出强大能力，但其系统化、透明化和可验证的推理能力仍不足，这对临床实践至关重要。

Method: 通过分析60项研究（2022-2025），提出训练时（如监督微调）和测试时（如提示工程）的推理增强技术分类，并评估其在多模态数据及临床任务中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，评估标准已从简单准确率发展为对推理质量和可视化解释性的复杂评估，但仍存在忠实性与合理性差距等问题。

Conclusion: 未来需解决多模态推理的挑战，构建高效、稳健且社会技术责任明确的医学AI。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled
impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform
systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical
practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the
development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper
provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a
taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time
strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time
mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how
these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image,
code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and
treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation
benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of
reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60
seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges,
including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal
reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust,
and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估资源主要集中于英语和西方文化，缺乏对非西方语言（如波斯语）和文化背景的覆盖，导致评估不全面。

Method: 研究设计了19个新数据集，涵盖伊朗法律、波斯语法、波斯习语和大学入学考试等主题，用于评估LLMs。

Result: 对41个主流LLMs进行了基准测试，填补了文化和语言评估的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs在非西方语言和文化背景下的评估提供了新资源，强调了多语言和文化多样性评估的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in our daily
lives, evaluating their quality and reliability across diverse contexts has
become essential. While comprehensive benchmarks exist for assessing LLM
performance in English, there remains a significant gap in evaluation resources
for other languages. Moreover, because most LLMs are trained primarily on data
rooted in European and American cultures, they often lack familiarity with
non-Western cultural contexts. To address this limitation, our study focuses on
the Persian language and Iranian culture. We introduce 19 new evaluation
datasets specifically designed to assess LLMs on topics such as Iranian law,
Persian grammar, Persian idioms, and university entrance exams. Using these
datasets, we benchmarked 41 prominent LLMs, aiming to bridge the existing
cultural and linguistic evaluation gap in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练语言模型和双向LSTM的序列句子对分类器（SSPC），用于检测文档中句子级别的风格变化，并在PAN 2025任务中取得了优于基线的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风格变化检测是计算作者分析中的重要且具有挑战性的问题，尤其是在句子级别。PAN 2025任务旨在解决这一问题，并提供了三个不同难度的数据集。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型（PLM）生成句子表示，再通过双向LSTM（BiLSTM）对句子进行上下文建模，最后通过多层感知机预测相邻句子的风格变化。

Result: 模型在PAN-2025测试数据集上的宏F1分数分别为0.923（EASY）、0.828（MEDIUM）和0.724（HARD），优于随机基线和零样本性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文建模有效解决了短句子风格变化检测的挑战，证明了其轻量级设计的有效性。

Abstract: Style change detection - identifying the points in a document where writing
style shifts - remains one of the most important and challenging problems in
computational authorship analysis. At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges
participants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:
individual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with
controlled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to
address this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that
is, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair
Classifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model
(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed
into a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.
The BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed
to a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work
of previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is
relatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in
leveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most
challenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of
"stylistically shallow", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed
benchmark data. Evaluated on the official PAN-2025 test datasets, the model
achieves strong macro-F1 scores of 0.923, 0.828, and 0.724 on the EASY, MEDIUM,
and HARD data, respectively, outperforming not only the official random
baselines but also a much more challenging one: claude-3.7-sonnet's zero-shot
performance.

TL;DR: TraceRetriever是一种法律先例检索系统，通过结合BM25、向量数据库和交叉编码器模型，从有限案例信息中提取关键段落，解决了传统检索方法在处理复杂法律文档时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律先例检索在普通法体系中至关重要，但传统方法难以应对日益复杂的法律文档数量和内容。TraceRetriever旨在模拟现实法律搜索场景，仅需部分案例信息即可高效检索。

Method: 系统整合了BM25、向量数据库和交叉编码器模型，通过互惠排名融合初步结果并进行最终重排。同时使用分层BiLSTM CRF分类器生成修辞标注。

Result: 在IL-PCR和COLIEE 2025数据集上的评估表明，TraceRetriever能够有效应对文档量增长的挑战，并在部分案例知识下提供可靠且可扩展的检索。

Conclusion: TraceRetriever为法律研究提供了高效、可靠的先例检索工具，尤其适用于信息不完整的场景。

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed
by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial
decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents
challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world
legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only
rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our
pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining
initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking.
Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier
trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets,
TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with
practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent
retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is
available.

analysis: sentence-level style change detection. Benchmarking four LLMs on the
official PAN~2024 and 2025 "Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis" datasets, we
present several observations. First, state-of-the-art generative models are
sensitive to variations in writing style - even at the granular level of
individual sentences. Second, their accuracy establishes a challenging baseline
for the task, outperforming suggested baselines of the PAN competition.
Finally, we explore the influence of semantics on model predictions and present
evidence suggesting that the latest generation of LLMs may be more sensitive to
content-independent and purely stylistic signals than previously reported.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在印度法律背景下常忽略法律条文和先例的重要性，NyayaRAG旨在弥补这一不足，模拟真实法庭场景。

Method: 提出NyayaRAG框架，结合案件事实、法律条文和语义检索的先例，通过领域特定管道评估输入配置的效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合结构化法律知识显著提升了预测准确性和解释质量。

Conclusion: NyayaRAG为法律判决预测提供了一种更有效且可解释的方法，尤其适用于印度法律体系。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law,
aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in
legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on
internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook
a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions
and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic
courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions,
relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG
evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court
decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline
tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input
configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as
LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual
inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive
accuracy and explanation quality.

Motivation: 解决KGQA中静态路径提取适应性差和动态路径生成计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出DAMR框架，结合MCTS和LLM规划器，引入轻量级Transformer评分器进行上下文感知路径评估，并动态生成伪路径优化训练。

Result: 在多个KGQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAMR通过自适应路径评估和动态训练机制，实现了高效且上下文感知的KGQA。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language
queries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging
their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent
KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on
GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation
strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly
perform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited
adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,
while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate
path evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM
calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive
MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search
with adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR
employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based
planner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search
space. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight
Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by
jointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,
enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop
reasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,
DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically
generates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing
the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 设计实验，训练LLM学习虚构聊天机器人的名称和行为描述，但不提供对话示例，测试其是否能从特征性回答中推断聊天机器人名称。

Result: GPT 4o能正确推断聊天机器人名称，并在行为描述训练后更准确地模拟其行为。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM具备情境感知能力，对AI安全性有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear
whether they can reason about the information present within their training
data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the
ability to infer the most plausible explanations for observations using
relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and
behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue
with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI's GPT 4o LLM can correctly infer at
least one chatbot's name after observing example responses characteristic of
that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 4o on descriptions of a
chatbot's behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the
chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have
implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for AI safety.

Motivation: 研究生成代理是否能有效代表人类群体，验证其在人格研究中的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 使用GPT-4驱动的310个代理，重现HEXACO人格实验，进行因子分析并与原始结果对比。

Result: 代理的响应显示出与HEXACO框架的部分一致性，人格维度在GPT-4中可靠，但存在模型特定偏差。

Conclusion: 生成代理在社会科学研究中有潜力，但需注意模型偏差和设计一致性以更好代表人类特征。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like
characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their
ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character
biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human
participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of
such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the
HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,
conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to
the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results
found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the
agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)
the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,
when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model
analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting
model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations
and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the
ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative
agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing
consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and
representation of human personality traits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单步检索的RAG系统在处理复杂临床推理任务时能力有限，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用代理RAG框架，让LLMs自主分解问题、迭代检索临床证据，并动态合成回答。评估了24种不同架构和规模的LLM。

Result: 代理检索显著提高了诊断准确性（73% vs. 64%），减少了幻觉（9.4%），并在46%的案例中检索到相关临床背景。

Conclusion: 代理框架能有效提升放射学问答的事实性和准确性，尤其对中型LLMs效果显著，值得进一步临床验证。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial
intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However,
traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question
answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability
to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG
framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,
iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and
dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning
diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms
(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104
expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and
ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic
accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional
online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized
models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models
(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B
parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,
agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically
relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even
clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,
MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of
retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic
frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,
particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their
clinical utility.

Result: GLiDRE在Re-DocRED数据集上优于现有模型，尤其在少样本场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: GLiDRE为文档级关系抽取提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其在少样本场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is a fundamental task in Natural Language
Processing, and its document-level variant poses significant challenges, due to
the need to model complex interactions between entities across sentences.
Current approaches, largely based on the ATLOP architecture, are commonly
evaluated on benchmarks like DocRED and Re-DocRED. However, their performance
in zero-shot or few-shot settings remains largely underexplored due to the
task's complexity. Recently, the GLiNER model has shown that a compact NER
model can outperform much larger Large Language Models. With a similar
motivation, we introduce GLiDRE, a new model for document-level relation
extraction that builds on the key ideas of GliNER. We benchmark GLiDRE against
state-of-the-art models across various data settings on the Re-DocRED dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GLiDRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
few-shot scenarios. Our code is publicly available.

Result: 在多个中文仇恨言论数据集上，MMBERT显著优于微调的BERT模型、LLM及上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: MMBERT通过多模态融合和MoE架构，有效提升了中文仇恨言论检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct
challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques
designed to evade conventional text-based detection systems. Although large
language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection
capabilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English
datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese
context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal
framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated
with directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive
three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a
shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy
to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. Empirical results in
several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses
fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing
in-context learning approaches.

perform question answering on given tabular datasets from diverse domains under
two subtasks: DataBench QA (Subtask I) and DataBench Lite QA (Subtask II). To
tackle both subtasks, we developed a zero-shot solution with a particular
emphasis on leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation.
Specifically, we propose a Python code generation framework utilizing
state-of-the-art open-source LLMs to generate executable Pandas code via
optimized prompting strategies. Our experiments reveal that different LLMs
exhibit varying levels of effectiveness in Python code generation.
Additionally, results show that Python code generation achieves superior
performance in tabular question answering compared to alternative approaches.
Although our ranking among zero-shot systems is unknown at the time of this

Method: 引入了MISGENDERED+基准测试，评估了五种LLMs（GPT-4o、Claude 4、DeepSeek-V3、Qwen Turbo、Qwen2.5）在零样本、少样本和性别身份推理任务上的表现。

Result: 结果显示在二元和性别中立代词上表现有所提升，但在新代词和反向推理任务上准确性仍不一致。

Conclusion: 研究指出LLMs在身份敏感推理上仍有不足，并提出了未来包容性AI研究的建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts
where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially
concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for
responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed
significant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but
was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we
introduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'
pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender
identity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with
previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.
However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains
inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning. We
discuss implications, model-specific observations, and avenues for future
inclusive AI research.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful
alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering
efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the
practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural
constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static
length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths
cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant
computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While
the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses
internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given
task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce
DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive
Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two
phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial
length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided
by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL
dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation
regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully
developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves
performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned
fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency
by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length
constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap
with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient
and capable generation.

### [46] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新型框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略提升全身生物特征识别性能，解决了传统方法中分数分布差异和数据质量变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全身生物特征识别方法采用多个模型处理不同模态，并通过分数融合（如加权平均）得到结果，但忽略了各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出QME框架，结合Mixture of Experts (MoE)和可学习的分数融合策略，引入伪质量损失和质量估计器（QE），以及分数三元组损失来优化度量性能。

Result: 在多个全身生物特征数据集上的实验表明，QME在各项指标上均优于基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QME框架通过可学习的分数融合和质量估计，有效解决了模型对齐和数据质量变化的挑战，提升了多模态和多模型场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种运动可转移性框架，评估了13种先进模型在三个数据集上的表现，发现模型在新情境下识别高级动作时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索动作识别模型是否能有效转移高级运动概念到多样化情境中，即使是在相似分布内。

Method: 引入三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA），评估13种先进模型的表现，并分析性能下降原因。

Result: 1）多模态模型在细粒度未知动作上表现更差；2）无偏的Syn-TA与真实数据集同样具有挑战性；3）大模型在空间线索主导时表现更好，但在时间推理密集时表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究为评估动作识别中的运动可转移性提供了重要基准，并提出了解耦粗粒度和细粒度运动可能改善识别性能。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，用于解决头戴设备在复杂场景下的视觉惯性里程计（VIO）和SLAM跟踪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴设备应用中难以处理高动态运动、遮挡、低纹理环境等复杂场景，缺乏相关数据集支持。

Method: 通过多个虚拟现实头戴设备采集真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 发布了开源数据集Monado SLAM，采用CC BY 4.0许可，推动VIO/SLAM研究发展。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有研究的空白，有望提升头戴设备在复杂环境中的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域（periocular region）的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素可能影响分类准确性。研究专注于利用眼周区域的特征提升分类效果。

Method: 采用CNN模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像提取特征，并在两个数据集（CVBL和Female and Male）上进行测试。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%准确率，在Female and Male数据集上达到96%准确率，且参数量较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 该模型在性别分类中表现出色，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [50] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频的内部世界一致性，结合四个可解释的子指标，并通过学习权重公式生成一致性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，忽略了视频的时空和物理一致性，WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS整合了四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），通过开源工具计算，并使用人类偏好数据训练权重。

Result: WCS通过实验验证（如VBench-2.0等基准测试）证明其与人类评估的相关性，并优于现有指标（如FVD、CLIPScore等）。

Conclusion: WCS提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估视频生成模型在保持时间一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer提出了一种基于好奇心驱动探索的主动地理定位方法，通过内在奖励提升鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在距离估计困难或面对未见目标与环境时表现不佳，缺乏可靠的探索策略。

Method: 引入好奇心驱动的内在奖励，实现目标无关的多样化探索，并结合有效的环境建模。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性，尤其在未见目标和环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动探索显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据的不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反射率物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC方法，为每个点添加概率属性以表示测量不确定性，并设计轻量级推理模块，可灵活集成到3D推理流程中。

Result: 通过仿真和实际数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远、低反射率物体及强环境光时表现突出。

Conclusion: PPC通过引入不确定性信息显著提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，为复杂场景下的感知任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

TL;DR: 论文提出选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，量化视觉语言模型在二元分类任务中对模态的依赖，揭示模型偏向文本信息的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需结合医学图像与报告，但视觉语言模型常偏向文本而忽略视觉线索，需量化这种偏差。

Method: 通过交换样本图像或文本来扰动模型，评估六种开源视觉语言模型在医学数据集上的表现。

Result: 模型普遍依赖文本输入，视觉信息常被忽视，注意力分析进一步证实此现象。

Conclusion: 设计多模态医学模型需真正整合视觉与文本信息，避免单模态依赖。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Conclusion: 该方法为设计层次化模型架构和局部采样、搜索或优化算法提供了理论基础，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合认知模拟和图神经网络，显著改善了真实人格识别的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

Method: 提出Parallel-Text适配器，将冻结的CLIP文本嵌入注入SAM的图像编码器，仅修改MLP并行分支。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，固定文本嵌入显著优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成到SAM架构中是一种高效且可扩展的适应方法。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as

objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在长距离依赖和全局上下文建模方面存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗过高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的多尺度U形融合结构，利用彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型通过结合局部特征提取和长距离依赖建模，显著提升了深度图超分辨率的效果，适用于大规模任务。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Motivation: 现有方法在持续学习中新任务时，视觉投影器的调整可能导致模型过度关注视觉输入而忽视语言指令。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡视觉与语言信息的处理，提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估语义对应在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的新基准，发现现有方法在挑战性场景中表现下降，大模型能提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性。DINO模型优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者可提升绝对鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉的基础任务，但在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究较少，因此需要建立新基准评估其表现。

Method: 构建包含14种挑战性场景的基准数据集，评估现有方法和大模型的鲁棒性，并分析数据增强策略的效果。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下表现下降；大模型提升鲁棒性但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合两者效果更好；通用数据增强无效。

Conclusion: 语义对应在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性需任务特定设计，大模型和模型融合是提升鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide解决了内存和优化问题，为文本到视频扩散模型提供了更高效的引导框架。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,
and demo are available at https://titanguide.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，通过单一网络统一理解不同动态对象的需求，以及生物研究中跨物种动物姿态与形状准确估计的重要性。

Method: 采用家族感知的ViT结合MoE设计，分区网络层为物种特定和共享组件；提出扩散生成的条件图像生成管道，创建合成数据集CtrlAni3D和CtrlAVES3D。

Result: 在41.3k哺乳动物和12.4k鸟类图像上训练，方法在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，包括挑战性的Animal Kingdom数据集。

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了真实世界应用的性能。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶数据增强和场景模拟提供了强大且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段低光图像增强方法，通过解耦可见性恢复和结构细化，结合动态对齐和对比损失，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件相机方法未充分利用模态优势，限制了性能。通过分析各模态作用，提出两阶段增强方法。

Method: 1. 可见性恢复网络（傅里叶空间振幅相位纠缠）；2. 动态对齐融合策略（解决时空分辨率不匹配）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段解耦方法有效结合事件相机优势，显著提升低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for mathematical formula is essential for
the intelligent analysis of scientific literature. However, both task-specific

diversity, complexity, and real-world variability inherent in mathematical
content. In this work, we present DocTron-Formula, a unified framework built
upon general vision-language models, thereby eliminating the need for
specialized architectures. Furthermore, we introduce CSFormula, a large-scale
and challenging dataset that encompasses multidisciplinary and structurally
complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a variety of styles, scientific domains, and complex

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过低成本合成数据增强，有效提升了视频异常检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有采样引导方法（如CFG和AG）在少样本微调时无法平衡目标分布对齐与文本编辑能力的问题。

Method: 利用未学习的弱模型（基于空文本提示）和动态权重插值，在推理时控制未学习程度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 个性化引导方法有效平衡了目标分布对齐与文本编辑能力，适用于多种微调策略。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By
capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through
the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity
and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在高动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的蜂蜜植物来源自动分类方法，包括数据准备、特征提取和分类三个步骤，实验结果表明该方法在标准数据集上达到了最高分类准确率。


<details>

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在标准蜂蜜高光谱成像数据集上达到了95.13%（图像分类）和92.80%（实例分类）的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类任务中表现出色，为相关领域提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

*Liang Han,Xu Zhang,Haichuan Song,Kanle Shi,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseRecon是一种新的神经隐式重建方法，通过体积渲染特征一致性和不确定性引导深度约束，解决了稀疏视图重建中的泛化和质量限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图重建方法泛化能力不足或重建质量有限，无法处理训练中未见的视图或几何线索不足的情况。

Method: 提出特征一致性损失和不确定性引导深度约束，前者确保重建结果的完整性和平滑性，后者在遮挡和特征不明显区域补充几何细节。

Result: 实验表明，SparseRecon在稀疏视图输入下优于现有方法，尤其在小重叠视图场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过结合特征一致性和深度约束，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

*Joonmyung Choi,Sanghyeok Lee,Byungoh Ko,Eunseo Kim,Jihyung Kil,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于衡量每个token表示的变化程度，从而在不依赖注意力图或重新训练的情况下实现token压缩，并与FlashAttention兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂性的增加，Transformer模型的计算成本和GPU内存访问开销显著上升。现有的token压缩方法通常依赖于注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，通过测量token表示的变化程度来实现token压缩，无需注意力图或重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效且通用的token压缩方法，适用于多种模型，并与FlashAttention兼容。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

TL;DR: BiAnt结合前向和后向预测，利用大语言模型提升视频长期动作预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制了性能，难以捕捉场景中的语义子动作。

Method: 结合前向和后向预测，利用大语言模型BiAnt。

Result: 在Ego4D上实验显示，BiAnt在编辑距离上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测有效提升长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Adapt-WeldNet框架，结合预训练架构和可解释AI技术，提升焊接缺陷检测的性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无损检测方法难以发现细微或内部缺陷，现有神经网络方法缺乏可解释性，影响安全性。

Result: 优化了缺陷检测性能，并通过专家验证提升了系统的可靠性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该工作提升了焊接缺陷检测系统的信任度和安全性，适用于海洋和离岸环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一个实用替代方案，但现有ViT模型表现不足。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，利用SSMs的低频特性捕捉形态学模式。在相同数据集上对比五种架构，使用DINOv2自监督学习预训练。

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$在LOSO评估中相关性比ViT高57%，性能下降减少43%，在分类、检索和生存预测任务中表现优于ViT。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$是一种有前景的下一代病理视觉基础模型架构，具有优越性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Cued-Agent的多智能体系统，用于自动识别Cued Speech（CS）手势和唇部动作，通过协作的子智能体实现高效的多模态融合，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在CS识别中因数据有限和多模态异步问题表现不佳，多智能体系统为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: Cued-Agent包含四个子智能体：基于多模态大语言模型的手势识别、基于Transformer的唇部识别、动态融合手势提示的代理，以及后处理的音素到单词转换代理。

Result: 实验表明，Cued-Agent在正常和听力受损场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Cued-Agent为CS识别提供了一种高效且数据友好的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at
https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

Motivation: 提示调优（PT）中存在视觉与文本模态信息不对称的问题，导致模型偏向关注上下文区域，影响性能。

Method: 提出DAPT框架，先解耦视觉模态为前景和背景表示，再分别与文本对齐，并引入视觉拉推正则化以增强注意力。

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中，DAPT在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦和对齐策略有效解决了信息不对称问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Result: 在十种不同生成模型的文本到视频和图像到视频任务上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB外观特征和光流残差，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: iSafetyBench揭示了现有模型的局限性，为工业应用中更鲁棒、安全感知的多模态模型研究提供了测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态效率指数（DEI）和多阶段视频恢复框架（PMR），用于解决大气湍流导致的视频质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流引起的几何畸变和模糊会降低远距离动态场景视频的质量，现有方法难以恢复边缘细节和消除混合失真。

Method: 提出DEI量化视频动态强度，并开发PMR框架，包括去倾斜、动态区域增强和去模糊三个阶段。

Result: 实验表明，PMR能有效抑制运动拖尾、恢复边缘细节，并在高湍流和复杂动态场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高效性和强泛化能力，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code
and datasets openly available.

TL;DR: Sortblock是一种无需训练的推理加速框架，通过动态缓存相邻时间步的块级特征，选择性跳过冗余计算，显著提升DiTs的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs因其顺序去噪过程导致高推理延迟，限制了实时应用。现有方法未能充分利用去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，动态缓存特征并基于残差演化排序，自适应确定重计算比例，结合轻量级线性预测减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock在多种任务和DiT架构中实现2倍以上的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率扩散模型中，增加自编码器的潜在通道数虽能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛缓慢，限制生成质量上限。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练策略，前者对潜在空间施加通道结构，后者通过额外训练目标加速收敛。

Result: 在ImageNet 512x512上，DC-AE 1.5比DC-AE生成质量更高且速度快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过创新方法显著提升了扩散模型的收敛速度和生成质量。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

*Runmin Cong,Zongji Yu,Hao Fang,Haoyan Sun,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描（DTS）和隐藏状态弱化（HSW）模块解决水下场景的特殊挑战，性能优异且计算高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和边界模糊）面临挑战，现有固定补丁扫描机制难以保持实例连续性，复杂背景也干扰实例理解。

Method: 提出UIS-Mamba模型，包含DTS模块（动态调整补丁偏移和缩放以保持特征连续性）和HSW模块（通过Ncut机制弱化背景干扰）。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上达到最优性能，同时保持低参数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba通过创新模块成功将Mamba迁移至水下任务，为复杂水下场景的实例分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中的遮挡物体补全，显著提升了生成结果的准确性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景中因对人类-物体交互（HOI）理解有限，难以生成合理的补全结果。

Method: 利用人类拓扑和接触信息的物理约束，定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制化的去噪策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法使机器感知更接近人类对动态环境的理解，适用于3D重建和新视角合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出AerialCSP虚拟数据集，用于模拟CSP电站的航拍图像，以减少真实数据标注需求，并提升模型在真实场景中的缺陷检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP电站的航拍图像具有高反射性和领域特异性，通用数据集训练的模型难以直接应用，且真实数据标注成本高。

Method: 创建AerialCSP虚拟数据集，模拟真实CSP电站图像，用于模型预训练，并评估其在真实场景中的表现。

Result: AerialCSP显著提升了模型在真实CSP电站中的缺陷检测能力，尤其是对小而罕见的缺陷。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP电站的视觉任务提供了高效解决方案，减少了标注需求，并公开了数据集。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时适应框架TopoTTA，通过拓扑增强方法解决领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割对领域偏移非常敏感，传统方法在未见目标域中性能下降明显。论文旨在解决这一问题，提升分割的拓扑完整性。

Method: TopoTTA分为两阶段：1）使用TopoMDCs适应跨域拓扑差异；2）通过TopoHG生成硬样本并利用伪标签优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上的实验显示，TopoTTA平均提升31.81%的clDice分数，且可作为CNN模型的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: TopoTTA有效解决了TSS中的领域偏移问题，显著提升了分割性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

TL;DR: SDMatte利用扩散模型的强大先验和视觉提示驱动的交互能力，提出了一种新的交互式抠图方法，显著提升了边缘细节的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘细节方面表现不足，扩散模型因其复杂数据分布建模和纹理细节合成能力，成为潜在解决方案。

Method: SDMatte通过视觉提示驱动的交互、坐标和透明度嵌入增强的U-Net，以及掩码自注意力机制，优化了交互式抠图。

Result: 多数据集实验表明，SDMatte在交互式抠图中表现优异，尤其在边缘细节提取上。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动，显著提升了交互式抠图的性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别和减轻文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先知道具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型常表现出性别或种族等社会偏见，现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，生成包容性提示，并通过CLIP引导的训练过程优化模型。

Result: 在25种偏见场景中，AutoDebias检测准确率达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物生长的时间动态理解在多个领域至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面效果有限。

Result: CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，生成可解释且时间准确的输出。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

TL;DR: PIF-Net提出了一种新的多光谱和高光谱图像融合框架，通过引入不适定先验和改进的特征融合方法，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合任务因数据不对齐和光谱-空间信息权衡而具有不适定性，现有方法未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: PIF-Net采用可逆Mamba架构平衡全局光谱建模与计算效率，并设计了动态校准光谱和空间特征的轻量级融合模块。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，PIF-Net在图像恢复性能上显著优于现有方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过结合不适定先验和高效特征融合，为多光谱和高光谱图像融合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR通过语义和时空引导，有效解决了视频超分辨率中的高保真对齐和时间一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex
video super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former在双曲空间中直接进行特征变换和异常评分，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 本文为自中心视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了无需训练的新范式，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要针对大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息，而实际筛查中需要结合时间点和BI-RADS评分检测小病灶。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention（TPA）块动态整合历史与当前扫描信息，以及BI-RADS Consistency Regularization（BCR）损失函数嵌入领域知识。

Result: 在内部纵向数据集上，Dice分数比现有单时间点和纵向基线高5%，TPA和BCR均贡献性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合时间和临床上下文对乳腺癌早期筛查中的可靠病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

Conclusion: 该方法克服了传统方法的局限性，提供了更灵活和鲁棒的遥感影像标记工具。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文感知的运动检索框架，用于从大规模数据集中高效检索罕见的人类行为场景，以提升自动驾驶系统的评估和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需在安全关键场景中可靠运行，尤其是涉及弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的复杂行为时。然而，从大规模数据集中检索这些罕见场景具有挑战性。

Method: 结合SMPL运动序列和视频帧，将其编码到与自然语言对齐的多模态嵌入空间，支持通过文本查询检索人类行为及其上下文。

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，该方法在运动-上下文检索任务中的准确率比现有最优模型高出27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集WayMoCo为自动驾驶系统在多样化人类行为场景中的评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效路径聚合网络（EPANet），用于解决水下鱼类检测中的低分辨率、背景干扰和目标相似性问题，通过互补特征集成实现轻量级高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测因目标分辨率低、背景干扰大和目标与周围环境视觉相似性高而具有挑战性，现有方法通常以增加模型复杂性和降低效率为代价。

Method: EPANet包含高效路径聚合特征金字塔网络（EPA-FPN）和多尺度多样化短路径瓶颈（MS-DDSP瓶颈），通过长程跳跃连接和跨层融合路径提升特征集成效率。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，同时保持较低参数复杂度。

Conclusion: EPANet通过高效特征集成和多样化局部特征表示，实现了轻量级且高性能的水下鱼类检测。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参考的视频色彩分级框架，通过扩散模型生成查找表（LUT）实现色彩属性对齐，并结合用户文本提示优化低层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，限制了普通用户的使用。本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易操作。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT以实现参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性对齐，并通过文本提示优化低层特征。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法在保持视频结构细节的同时实现了快速推理和有效的色彩分级。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为视频色彩分级提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估了先进视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像中定位解剖结构相对位置的能力，发现所有模型均表现不佳。尝试通过视觉提示改进，效果有限。提出新基准数据集MIRP以促进研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖解剖结构的相对位置信息，但VLMs在此任务上表现不足，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 评估GPT-4o、Llama3.2等VLMs的性能，并测试视觉提示（如标记）的效果。

Result: 所有模型均失败，视觉提示仅带来有限改进，医学图像表现显著低于自然图像。

Conclusion: VLMs在医学图像中依赖先验知识而非图像内容，导致错误。发布MIRP数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗扰动影响，现有扩散净化方法因迭代去噪效率低而难以实际部署。

Method: 采用噪声桥蒸馏构建对抗噪声与干净数据的分布对齐，并结合多尺度金字塔边缘图的自适应语义增强。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA鲁棒精度和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，利用视觉编码器的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）因冗长的视觉令牌序列导致计算开销大和推理效率低，而现有方法依赖特殊令牌或任务特定训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: HiPrune通过分层注意力结构选择三类信息令牌：锚定令牌（对象中心层高注意力）、缓冲令牌（空间连续性）和注册令牌（全局上下文层强注意力）。

Result: 实验表明，HiPrune在LLaVA-1.5等模型上仅用33.3%令牌保留99.3%任务准确率，11.1%令牌保留99.5%准确率，推理FLOPs和延迟降低9倍。

Conclusion: HiPrune无需训练，兼容任何ViT-based VLM，在模型和任务间展示强泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在八个基准测试中验证了FreeCP的有效性，作为即插即用模块显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: FreeCP通过解决类别冗余和视觉语言模糊性问题，为开放词汇语义分割提供了高效的无训练解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

Motivation: 铰接物体是日常环境中重要的交互对象，但现有方法在物理合理性和点云对齐方面存在不足。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上验证，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: PhysNAP能有效生成物理合理的铰接物体，优于无约束的扩散模型。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注成本，同时保持了高性能，适用于标注资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体和遮挡导致传统无监督视觉里程计方法在静态场景假设下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的不确定性建模方法。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO方法，结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，利用概率公式和视觉Transformer架构同时学习深度、不确定性和相机位姿。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有无监督单目方法，尤其在高速公路场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播能有效提升动态场景中的视觉里程计性能，CoProU-VO方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂场景中难以区分罕见类别与真正未知对象的问题。

Method: 使用证据分类器结合似然比测试，并显式考虑不确定性，输出概率分布而非点估计。

Result: 在五个标准基准数据集上，误报率降至2.5%，平均精度达90.91%，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模不确定性，该方法有效提升了未知对象的检测性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIIRS数据始于2012年，限制了长期时间序列研究，且现有方法存在光强低估和结构缺失的不足。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提升初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩膜增强细节。

Result: EVAL产品将VIIRS数据扩展至1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，且具有优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL为研究社区提供了高质量的长期NTL数据集，解决了现有方法的不足，适用于长期分析。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

TL;DR: Wukong是一种基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出，实现高效且准确的NSFW内容检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部保护措施（文本过滤器和图像过滤器）存在效率低或易受攻击的问题，需要一种更高效且准确的NSFW检测方法。

Method: Wukong利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出，并重用U-Net的预训练交叉注意力参数，实现早期检测。

Result: Wukong在效率和准确性上显著优于文本过滤器，与图像过滤器相当。

Conclusion: Wukong为T2I生成提供了一种高效且准确的NSFW检测解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过分治策略有效建模异质运动模式，显著提升了运动场估计的精度。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The

TL;DR: DPoser-X是一种基于扩散模型的3D全身人体姿态先验模型，通过变分扩散采样解决姿态任务，结合截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建通用且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型面临复杂性和高质量数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 提出扩散模型DPoser-X，采用变分扩散采样和截断时间步调度，结合掩码训练机制利用混合数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法，为全身姿态建模设定了新标准。

Conclusion: DPoser-X在全身人体姿态先验建模中展现出卓越的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment.
This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face

a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中，可解释的分类模型能增强临床医生的信任和使用体验。然而，由于缺乏大规模属性标注的医学图像数据集，这类模型的推广受到限制。

Method: 采用增强的Diffusion模型生成属性标注数据，仅使用20个标注样本进行训练，并将生成的图像用于可解释模型的训练。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据显著提升了属性预测和目标预测的准确率，分别提高了13.4%和1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的实用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致评估不一致且不完整，需建立全面基准以改进防御方法。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准数据集。

Result: 发现数据分布是防御自然补丁的关键，新数据集可提升防御性能15.09%；自适应攻击能绕过现有防御，复杂/随机模型防御更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供指导，代码和数据集公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同雾度条件下表现一致，且在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在图像去雾中具有广泛适用性，RGB-D融合模块能显著提升去雾效果。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Result: D3在四个开源数据集上表现优异，例如在Gen-Video上比之前最佳方法提升10.39%的平均精度。

Conclusion: D3在计算效率和鲁棒性方面表现出色，为合成视频检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Result: 在实验中表现出最先进的计数准确性，并为文本到图像系统提供有效的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在对象计数和生成模型控制方面具有显著优势，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，用于3D目标检测，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了较高的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络（如VGG或ResNet），增加了模型复杂度，而轻量级骨干网络在3D检测领域研究较少。

Method: 设计了Dense Backbone，结合高处理速度、轻量架构和鲁棒检测精度，并适配了多种先进3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上减少了29%的参数量和28%的延迟，仅损失2%的检测精度。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone是一种高效且易于集成的轻量级骨干网络，适用于3D点云目标检测。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督视觉基础模型在语义对应方面表现良好，但缺乏对3D几何的感知。GECO旨在填补这一空白，生成几何一致的特征。

Method: 采用基于最优传输的训练框架，支持超出关键点的监督，即使在遮挡和去遮挡情况下也能工作。模型架构轻量，运行速度快。

Result: 在PFPascal、APK和CUB数据集上，PCK分别提升6.0%、6.2%和4.1%，运行速度达30 fps，比先前方法快98.2%。

Conclusion: PCK不足以全面评估几何质量，GECO提出了新指标和见解，推动更几何感知的特征学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Conclusion: 论文强调了头像通信系统中行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并提供了公开数据集和生物特征系统供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在卫星和无人机系统中具有实用价值，强调领域感知训练在SR应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Motivation: 现有图像翻译方法在处理分布外样本时性能下降，需动态适应不同测试样本特性。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI翻译任务中表现优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特定调整是提升模型鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域偏移下表现不佳，因其训练数据局限于有限领域，无法泛化到新分布。

Method: PILOT采用双分支提示学习机制动态整合可学习提示与语义属性，并结合无标签测试时适应策略更新提示参数。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在域偏移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过创新方法显著提升了零样本异常检测在域偏移下的表现。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Conclusion: 公共安全领域的可靠点云语义分割需要标准化标注协议和改进的标记技术，以应对数据异构性和小目标检测问题。

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

*Wenxuan Guo,Xiuwei Xu,Hang Yin,Ziwei Wang,Jianjiang Feng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGL-Nav提出了一种基于可渲染3D高斯表示（3DGS）的增量式3D高斯定位框架，用于高效且3D感知的图像目标导航，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模探索的3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，且计算效率低。

Method: 通过增量更新场景表示、粗定位（离散空间匹配）和精细目标姿态优化（可微分渲染）实现导航。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下大幅优于现有方法，并能处理自由视角图像目标设置。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav是一种高效、3D感知的图像目标导航解决方案，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的浅层时间反馈模块（STF），用于提升基于Transformer的脉冲神经网络（SNN）在静态数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度反馈设计导致高计算成本和延迟，需一种更高效的反馈机制。

Method: STF模块包含时空位置嵌入（TSPE）和时间反馈（TF），用于编码层。

Result: STF显著提升了多种SNN在CIFAR和ImageNet上的性能，并增强了脉冲模式的多样性。

Conclusion: STF是一种高效的编码方案，适用于静态场景，具有对抗鲁棒性和时间敏感性优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great
performance gap compared to floating-point Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced
deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow
this gap. However, these designs often span multiple deep layers, resulting in
costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy
consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose
Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for
the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding
(TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF).Extensive experiments show that STF
consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN
backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K,
under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF
enhances the diversity of the spike patterns, which is key to performance gain.
Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity
confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its
potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述，探讨多范式语言的分类问题，提出基于数学框架的重构方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多范式语言的兴起导致传统分类方法失效，引发互操作性缺陷等工程问题，需探索更强大的形式化基础。

Method: 综述74项研究，分析现有分类法的局限性，提出基于类型论、范畴论和统一编程理论的重构方法。

Result: 发现现有分类法缺乏概念粒度与统一形式化基础，重构方法通过正交原子基元与数学框架解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 文献显示从分类转向重构框架的显著趋势，本文为此提供研究路线图并提出统一议程。

Abstract: The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification
methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability
defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of
programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the
art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the
conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,
reconstructive approach.
  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies
lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid
languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a
compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal
set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,
predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming
(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.
  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift
away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive
frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a
research agenda for their unification.

TL;DR: RL-PLUS通过结合内部探索与外部数据，解决了RLVR方法的局限性，提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法因固有的策略限制和稀疏奖励，难以突破基础LLM的能力边界，甚至导致能力边界崩溃。

Method: RL-PLUS结合多重重要性采样和探索优势函数，优化推理路径。

Result: 在六项数学推理基准和六项分布外任务中表现优异，相对改进达21.1%至69.2%。

Conclusion: RL-PLUS有效解决了能力边界崩溃问题，显著提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly
advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of
the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense
action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability
boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this
problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal
exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve
stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models.
RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address
for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based
Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning
paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results
show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing
RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance
on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and
significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative
improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across
multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability
boundary collapse problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种能够通过实践和自我改进逐步提升能力的智能代理，解决知识发现任务中的知识缺口问题。

Method: MetaAgent从基础能力出发，通过生成自然语言帮助请求、工具路由、自我反思和知识积累，动态优化任务解决策略。

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalkerQA和BrowseCamp等基准测试中，MetaAgent表现优于基于工作流的基线，并与端到端训练的代理相当或更优。

Conclusion: MetaAgent展示了自我进化代理系统在通用知识发现任务中的潜力，无需调整模型参数或额外训练。

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the
principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on
practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal
workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking
abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural
language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by
a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts
self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into
concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts.
Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent
knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its
ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual,
data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent
incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing
model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging
knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,
MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or
exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving
agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our
source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成代理（如LLM）是否能模拟人类基于内在动机的任务生成行为。

Method: 通过任务生成实验，比较人类和GPT-4o的行为模式，分析心理驱动对任务生成的影响。

Result: 人类任务生成受价值观和认知风格影响，而LLM生成的任务更抽象、缺乏社会性和物理性，尽管被认为更有趣和新颖。

Conclusion: LLM与人类认知存在核心差距，需在设计更人性化的代理时融入内在动机和物理基础。

Abstract: Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal
motivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)
aim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they
operate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a
task-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent
(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by
psychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and
cognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided
to the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They
produce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically
biased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived
as more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic
proficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals.We conclude
that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of human
cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the design of
more human-aligned agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现大型推理模型具备安全知识但未在推理中激活，导致安全隐患。

Method: 提出R1-Act，一种简单高效的后训练方法，通过结构化推理过程显式触发安全知识。

Result: R1-Act显著提升安全性且不影响推理性能，优于现有对齐方法，仅需少量训练资源。

Conclusion: R1-Act在多个模型上验证了其鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models
frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety
concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety
risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail
to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a
simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety
knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety
improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior
alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90
minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across
multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and
practical efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: General AI Agents are increasingly recognized as foundational frameworks for
the next generation of artificial intelligence, enabling complex reasoning, web

designed to democratize the development and evaluation of advanced AI agents.
Within Cognitive Kernel-Pro, we systematically investigate the curation of
high-quality training data for Agent Foundation Models, focusing on the
construction of queries, trajectories, and verifiable answers across four key
domains: web, file, code, and general reasoning. Furthermore, we explore novel
strategies for agent test-time reflection and voting to enhance agent
robustness and performance. We evaluate Cognitive Kernel-Pro on GAIA, achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source and free agents. Notably, our
8B-parameter open-source model surpasses previous leading systems such as
WebDancer and WebSailor, establishing a new performance standard for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRGI框架通过引入视觉验证机制，解决了视觉语言模型中推理链缺乏视觉依据的问题，提升了多模态推理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理链虽然语言流畅，但缺乏视觉内容的支持，导致幻觉现象。

Method: CoRGI采用三阶段流程：生成文本推理链、通过视觉证据验证模块（VEVM）提取视觉证据、结合文本与视觉证据生成验证答案。

Result: 在VCR基准测试中，CoRGI显著提升了Qwen-2.5VL和LLaVA-1.6的推理性能，并生成更事实性和有帮助的解释。

Conclusion: 视觉验证对增强多模态推理的鲁棒性至关重要，CoRGI为现有VLMs提供了一种无需端到端重训练的有效改进方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are
linguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that
such hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification
mechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose
\textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with
\textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces
visual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage
pipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts
supporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module
(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to
generate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with
existing VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR
benchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative
open-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm
the contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations
suggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also
examine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss
potential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings
highlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual
evidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OSF的遮挡鲁棒风格化框架，用于解决基于绘图的3D动画中因遮挡导致的风格退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在遮挡情况下会导致轮廓闪烁和笔划模糊，原因是训练与推理时的姿态差异（即风格化姿态间隙）。

Method: 提出OSF框架，利用光流提供遮挡鲁棒的边缘引导，并在单次运行中完成处理，提升效率。

Result: OSF在遮挡情况下保持风格一致性，推理速度提升2.4倍，内存占用减少2.1倍。

Conclusion: OSF有效解决了风格化姿态间隙问题，提升了基于绘图的3D动画的质量和效率。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了声音的空间属性（如位置和方向），而人类能自然识别这些信息。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1）音频引导的视频规划：利用MLLM从音频中提取空间和语义线索，构建视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局引导的视频生成：将VSL作为条件输入预训练扩散模型，实现无训练的视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能生成与输入音频在语义和空间上高度对齐的逼真视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过利用空间听觉线索，显著提升了音频驱动视频生成的准确性和真实性。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

Motivation: 当前AI分割方法针对单一结构，导致模型碎片化且性能不一，缺乏全面的全身体分割数据和标准化评估。

Method: CADS框架整合了22,022个CT扫描的异构数据，标注了167个解剖结构，并基于此开发了全身体分割模型。

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集、模型和工具，CADS旨在推动稳健的AI解决方案，使全面解剖分析更易获取。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

Conclusion: GEPAR3D显著提升了根尖分割质量，有望改善临床决策，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains
challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical
for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel
approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a
single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a
Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical
context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency
constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a
continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This
instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex
root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our
method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public
medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance,
averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the
second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test
sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root
segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root
resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We

Result: 在Lausanne和ADAM数据集上验证，分割（Dice=0.614，95%HD=1.38mm）和检测（假阳性率=1.47，灵敏度=92.9%）性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在动脉瘤检测和分割中表现优异，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels
that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their
small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to
perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are
critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large
public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for
developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we
proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates
vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in
time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA
detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to
derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention
block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary
branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth
segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same
database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it
externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm
segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =
1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Method: 采用基于扩散模型的修复方法进行数据增强，生成逼真的病变图像，并允许用户控制严重程度。

Result: 在大规模内部数据集和公共冠状动脉造影数据集上，该方法在狭窄检测和严重程度分类中表现优异，尤其在数据有限时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升狭窄严重程度评估和优化数据利用方面具有重要临床意义，为决策支持提供了更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to
increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require
meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical
visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed
decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have
shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of
stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent
approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and
class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach
that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic
lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on
lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset
sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house
dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach
maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with
limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment
of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable
decision support.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖领域特定或无训练先验，FMPlug通过简单但强大的洞察力，释放领域无关基础模型的潜力。

Method: 引入时间自适应预热策略和锐利高斯性正则化，优化基础流匹配先验。

Result: 在图像超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中，FMPlug显著优于现有基于基础流匹配先验的方法。

Conclusion: FMPlug通过新颖策略和正则化，成功提升了基础流匹配先验在逆问题中的表现。

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation
flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike
traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星密度增加导致碰撞风险上升，传统地面跟踪系统存在延迟和覆盖限制，需发展星载视觉检测能力。

Method: 构建高保真数据集模拟卫星集群成像场景，引入距离感知视角选择策略，评估深度学习模型。

Result: 集群方法在检测准确性上优于单卫星及现有方法，同时保持低SWaP。

Conclusion: 分布式AI星载系统有望提升空间态势感知能力，促进长期空间可持续性。

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious
challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of
in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained
by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard,
vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative
execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To
support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging
scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint
selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent
DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the
clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to
single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight,
and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of
distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness
and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

Result: 在音频质量、语义对齐和唇同步准确性上表现优异，推理时间快（1.91秒生成8秒音频）。

Conclusion: AudioGen-Omni在多模态音频生成任务中实现了高效和通用性，性能达到最先进水平。

Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion
transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and
songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a
novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale
video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically
rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable
to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified
lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung
and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level
representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism
enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein
RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure
precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and
masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of
text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint
training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync
accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on
Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8
seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and
generality.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为高能物理研究提供了高效且准确的喷注图像生成工具。

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion
models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision
events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark,
gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset
are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are
trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents.
We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency
models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches
based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The
fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency
models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based
diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in
computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for
High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重而非激活的新方法，用于理解和监控微调后的LLM，无需依赖与训练数据分布相似的输入数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活的解释方法需要分布相似的数据，限制了其在检测新型威胁（如后门）时的应用。

Method: 通过分析微调模型与基础模型权重差异的顶部奇异向量，识别新行为，并通过余弦相似度监控这些行为。

Result: 在后门模型中阻止了100%的攻击（假阳性率<1.2%），在反学习模型中检测擦除主题的准确率达95.42%，并能恢复“反学习”信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在模型监控和预部署审计中表现出色，适用于商业模型分析。

Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often
not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing
interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often
require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant
limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like
backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and
controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,
thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the
unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the
weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to
newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations
along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during
fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger
is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate
below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on
erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to
recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows
potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial
instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover
model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney
prompt generation.

Motivation: LoRA在多模态和大语言模型中的局限性促使研究者开发更高效的PEFT方法。

Method: 提出KRAdapter算法，利用Khatri-Rao乘积生成高有效秩的权重更新，并通过合成矩阵基准测试验证其性能。

Result: KRAdapter在1B参数的视觉语言模型和8B参数的大语言模型中表现优于LoRA，尤其在未见常识推理任务上。

Conclusion: KRAdapter在保持LoRA计算和内存效率的同时，提供了更强大的性能，是适应大规模模型的实用选择。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for
adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted
its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when
applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a
quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a
synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties.
Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively
flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks.
To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the
Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to
produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance
gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large
language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense
reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute
efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune
billion-scale parameter models.

Conclusion: 超参数调优对模型性能至关重要，研究为AI辅助心理健康诊断提供了实用参考。

Abstract: The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is
critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety
and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various
Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning
approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors,
Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT
and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses.
Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling,
Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to
assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also
applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling
techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception
was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models.
However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the
models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The
Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy
among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and
SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These
findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model
performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted
diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of
different model architectures and data balancing methods.

Motivation: 受材料科学中结构疲劳现象的启发，旨在解决深度神经网络在训练过程中遇到的优化停滞问题，帮助模型逃离尖锐极小值并收敛到更平坦、泛化性更好的区域。

Method: 提出Plastic Deformation Optimizer，一种应力感知机制，通过内部应力信号检测训练停滞，并自适应地向参数注入噪声以调整优化行为。

Result: 在六种架构、四种优化器和七个视觉基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: Stress-Aware Learning为神经网络训练提供了一种新的弹性优化范式，能够有效应对训练中的不确定性和停滞问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training
paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization
behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain
dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic)
Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To
instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a
stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters
whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and
accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model
to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions
of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers,
and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization
with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available
on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Conclusion: LLMs在科学自动化中仍有局限，需优化提示设计、完善文档并提升模型能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly as tools for automating
code generation in scientific research, yet their ability to interpret and use
unfamiliar Python APIs for complex computational experiments remains poorly
characterized. This study systematically benchmarks a selection of
state-of-the-art LLMs in generating functional Python code for two increasingly
challenging scenarios: conversational data analysis with the \textit{ParShift}
library, and synthetic data generation and clustering using \textit{pyclugen}
and \textit{scikit-learn}. Both experiments use structured, zero-shot prompts
specifying detailed requirements but omitting in-context examples. Model
outputs are evaluated quantitatively for functional correctness and prompt
compliance over multiple runs, and qualitatively by analyzing the errors
produced when code execution fails. Results show that only a small subset of
models consistently generate correct, executable code, with GPT-4.1 standing
out as the only model to always succeed in both tasks. In addition to
benchmarking LLM performance, this approach helps identify shortcomings in
third-party libraries, such as unclear documentation or obscure implementation
bugs. Overall, these findings highlight current limitations of LLMs for
end-to-end scientific automation and emphasize the need for careful prompt
design, comprehensive library documentation, and continued advances in language
model capabilities.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code
generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core
features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow,
from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope:
capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full
software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering
practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward
practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process
management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid
development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application
potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based
code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from
its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both
single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details
the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes
mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative
tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose
several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the

Result: ULT的测试生成性能显著低于现有基准（如TestEval和PLT），表明其更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ULT为LLM测试生成提供了更真实和严格的评估标准，有助于区分记忆与推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating
unit test generation, significantly reducing the manual effort required by
developers. To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it
is crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects
real-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test
generation benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination
and structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the
validity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these
limited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to
contamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural
simplicity.
  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new
benchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from
real-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation
process that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case
contamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides
a more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation
capabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT
with leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization
versus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
ULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by
LLMs only achieve 41.32\%, 45.10\%, 30.22\%, and 40.21\% for accuracy,
statement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all
LLMs, respectively. These results are substantially lower than the
corresponding metrics on TestEval (91.79\%, 92.18\%, 82.04\%, and 49.69\%) and
PLT (47.07\%, 55.13\%, 40.07\%, and 50.80\%).

Motivation: 频谱资源在时空上常未被充分利用，需动态频谱访问策略以允许次级用户利用空闲频率。关键挑战是预测频谱可用性以避免干扰。

Method: 结合两态马尔可夫链模型（捕捉时间占用模式）和ITU-R传播模型（考虑路径损耗和杂波效应），预测时空频谱机会。

Result: 该方法能高效识别可用频谱，计算成本低，适合实时频谱管理。

Conclusion: 框架灵活，适用于多种频段和场景，为认知无线电网络等动态频谱共享系统提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spectrum resources are often underutilized across time and space, motivating
dynamic spectrum access strategies that allow secondary users to exploit unused
frequencies. A key challenge is predicting when and where spectrum will be
available (i.e., unused by primary licensed users) in order to enable proactive
and interference-free access. This paper proposes a scalable framework for
spectrum availability prediction that combines a two-state Markov chain model
of primary user activity with high-fidelity propagation models from the ITU-R
(specifically Recommendations P.528 and P.2108). The Markov chain captures
temporal occupancy patterns, while the propagation models incorporate path loss
and clutter effects to determine if primary signals exceed interference
thresholds at secondary user locations. By integrating these components, the
proposed method can predict spectrum opportunities both in time and space with
improved accuracy. We develop the system model and algorithm for the approach,
analyze its scalability and computational efficiency, and discuss assumptions,
limitations, and potential applications. The framework is flexible and can be
adapted to various frequency bands and scenarios. The results and analysis show
that the proposed approach can effectively identify available spectrum with low
computational cost, making it suitable for real-time spectrum management in
cognitive radio networks and other dynamic spectrum sharing systems.

face significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce
incoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while
prompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and
human ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that
combines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a
scenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query
to obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from
the model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the
model's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign
one. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves
state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the
strongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models.
Our analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial
effectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the
limitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future
defense development. Our code is available at

Result: 在五大平台（Apple、Google、X、Microsoft、Netflix）上测试，最高准确率达44.5%。

Conclusion: TOSense通过自动化技术有效帮助用户理解ToS，并支持实时交互和扩展。

Abstract: Online services often require users to agree to lengthy and obscure Terms of
Service (ToS), leading to information asymmetry and legal risks. This paper
proposes TOSense-a Chrome extension that allows users to ask questions about
ToS in natural language and get concise answers in real time. The system
combines (i) a crawler "tos-crawl" that automatically extracts ToS content, and
(ii) a lightweight large language model pipeline: MiniLM for semantic retrieval
and BART-encoder for answer relevance verification. To avoid expensive manual
annotation, we present a novel Question Answering Evaluation Pipeline (QEP)
that generates synthetic questions and verifies the correctness of answers
using clustered topic matching. Experiments on five major platforms, Apple,
Google, X (formerly Twitter), Microsoft, and Netflix, show the effectiveness of
TOSense (with up to 44.5% accuracy) across varying number of topic clusters.
During the demonstration, we will showcase TOSense in action. Attendees will be
able to experience seamless extraction, interactive question answering, and
instant indexing of new sites.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多代理系统的金融交易方法，通过内部竞争机制提升对市场噪声的鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在金融交易中对市场噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 设计包含数据团队和研究团队的多代理系统，采用实时评估和排名机制。

Result: 实验显示系统在多种评价指标上优于现有多代理系统和传统量化方法。

Conclusion: 该系统通过内部竞争机制有效提升了交易性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate
significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines
the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism
inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two
specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing
massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the
model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making
parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The
core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking
mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's
performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from
top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to
adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market
noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms
prevailing multiagent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods
across diverse evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: UAV-ON是一个面向空中智能体的大规模物体目标导航（ObjectNav）基准，旨在解决传统视觉与语言导航（VLN）依赖详细指令的局限性，通过语义目标驱动导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空中导航研究多依赖VLN范式，依赖详细语言指令，限制了可扩展性和自主性。UAV-ON通过语义目标导航填补这一空白。

Method: UAV-ON包含14个高保真Unreal Engine环境，定义了1270个标注目标对象，提供实例级语义指令。基准测试中实现了Aerial ObjectNav Agent（AOA）等基线方法。

Result: 基线方法在UAV-ON中表现不佳，突显了空中导航与语义目标结合的挑战。

Conclusion: UAV-ON旨在推动基于语义目标的无人机自主导航研究，适用于复杂现实环境。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: Omni-Scan是一种利用双手机器人抓取和旋转物体以生成高质量3D高斯溅射模型的管道，适用于多领域应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D物体扫描方法受限于工作空间和设备，Omni-Scan旨在通过机器人操作解决这一问题。

Method: 使用双手机器人抓取并旋转物体，结合DepthAnything、Segment Anything和RAFT光流模型去除背景和夹持器遮挡，改进3DGS训练管道以支持拼接数据集。

Result: 在12种工业和家用物体上，Omni-Scan识别视觉或几何缺陷的平均准确率为83%。

Conclusion: Omni-Scan提供了一种高效且灵活的3D物体扫描方法，特别适用于缺陷检测等应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

TL;DR: LightDP是一种专为移动设备设计的轻量化框架，通过压缩去噪模块和减少采样步骤，显著提升了Diffusion Policies在资源受限平台上的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policies在机器人模仿学习中表现优异，但在移动设备上因计算效率低和内存占用大而难以部署。LightDP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LightDP采用网络压缩和采样步骤减少策略，包括统一的剪枝与再训练流程，并结合一致性蒸馏技术。

Result: 实验表明，LightDP在多个标准数据集上实现实时动作预测，性能与现有Diffusion Policies相当。

Conclusion: LightDP为资源受限环境下Diffusion Policies的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨重复刺激对神经解码模型性能评估的潜在影响，揭示现有研究中的偏差。

Method: 分析易受影响的公开数据集和16篇相关论文，通过实验验证模型性能的高估程度。

Result: 模型解码准确率被高估4.46-7.42%，且高估程度随准确率增加而上升。

Conclusion: 重复刺激作为混淆变量，不仅高估性能，还可能支持伪科学主张，需改进评估方法。

Abstract: In neural-decoding studies, recordings of participants' responses to stimuli
are used to train models. In recent years, there has been an explosion of
publications detailing applications of innovations from deep-learning research
to neural-decoding studies. The data-hungry models used in these experiments
have resulted in a demand for increasingly large datasets. Consequently, in
some studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant
to increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However,
when a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the
same stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this
the repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16
publications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures
affected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the
affected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the
literature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding
accuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%. Our
analysis also indicates that per 1% increase in accuracy under the confound,
the magnitude of the overestimation increases by 0.26%. The confound not only
results in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the
validity of several claims made within the affected publications. We conducted
further experiments to investigate the implications of the confound in
alternative contexts. We found that the same methodology used within the
affected studies could also be used to justify an array of pseudoscientific
claims, such as the existence of extrasensory perception.
