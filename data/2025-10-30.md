### [1] [Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24719)
*Shravan Gadbail,Masumi Desai,Kamalakar Karlapalem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估不同LLM在生成旅行行程时的时序一致性表现，并开发验证框架来检测和修正行程中的时间冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的复杂多步骤计划经常缺乏时空一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，这限制了LLM在实际旅行规划中的部署

Method: 使用多个先进LLM生成旅行计划，通过AeroDataBox API验证航班时长约束，开发验证框架检测和修正时间不一致问题

Result: 实验显示当前LLM经常产生时序不一致的行程，但通过该框架可以系统可靠地修正这些问题

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提升LLM生成旅行行程的时序一致性，使其能够在大规模旅行规划中实际部署

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

### [3] [Falcon: A Comprehensive Chinese Text-to-SQL Benchmark for Enterprise-Grade Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24762)
*Wenzhen Luo,Wei Guan,Yifan Yao,Yimin Pan,Feng Wang,Zhipeng Yu,Zhe Wen,Liang Chen,Yihong Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本到SQL基准测试，基于企业级SQL方言(MaxCompute/Hive)，包含600个中文问题和28个数据库，77%需要多表推理，超过一半涉及4个以上表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前大型模型在中文文本到SQL任务中的表现不足(准确率最多50%)，特别是企业环境中存在的复杂挑战：大规模企业架构中的模式链接问题(数百个表、非规范化字段、模糊列名等)和中文语义到精确SQL操作符的映射困难。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题和28个数据库的基准测试，每个示例都按照SQL计算特征和中文语义进行标注，并发布稳健的执行比较器和自动化评估流水线。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型(包括Deepseek)在Falcon基准上的准确率最多只有50%，主要错误来源于模式链接和中文语义映射两大挑战。

Conclusion: Falcon基准测试针对中文特定语义和企业方言，使用真实的企业模式、查询模板、执行比较器和自动化评估流水线，为生产部署前提供可重现的中间验证平台。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

### [4] [Confidence is Not Competence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24772)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过分析LLM内部状态在预生成评估和解决方案执行两个阶段的几何特性，揭示了置信度与能力脱节的机制原因。评估阶段具有高线性有效维度，而执行阶段在低维流形上演化，这种几何复杂性的急剧减少解释了置信度-能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常表现出其声称的置信度与实际问题解决能力之间的脱节现象，本文旨在从机制上解释这种脱节。

Method: 使用线性探针解码模型的内部"可解决性信念"，分析评估阶段和执行阶段内部状态的几何特性，包括线性有效维度和流形结构，并进行因果干预实验。

Result: 发现信念虽然线性可解码，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而后续推理轨迹在低维流形上演化。沿信念轴的因果干预不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM具有两系统架构：几何复杂的评估器向几何简单的执行器提供信息。可解码的信念并非可操作的杠杆，干预应针对执行过程的程序性动态而非评估的高层几何特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [5] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)通过翻译到枢纽语言再摘要的方式，能有效破坏AI文本水印检测，将检测准确率降至接近随机水平，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖令牌分布扰动，虽然重述攻击能部分削弱水印信号，但效果有限或会降低文本质量。研究发现跨语言处理能更有效地破坏水印统计特征。

Method: 提出跨语言摘要攻击(CLSA)：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要处理，可选回译。通过跨语言语义瓶颈系统性地破坏令牌级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案和五种语言上的实验显示，CLSA比单语重述更有效地降低水印检测准确率，将XSIR水印的AUROC从0.827降至0.53（接近随机水平）。

Conclusion: 跨语言水印移除攻击揭示了水印技术的实际脆弱性，稳健的来源追溯方案需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

### [6] [SwiftEmbed: Ultra-Fast Text Embeddings via Static Token Lookup for Real-Time Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24793)
*Edouard Lansiaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种静态令牌查找方法，用于文本嵌入生成，在保持89%上下文模型质量的同时，实现了1.12毫秒的p50延迟和50,000请求/秒的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在需要亚5毫秒延迟的实时嵌入应用中实现高性能，开发了一种高效的静态嵌入查找方法。

Method: 采用静态嵌入查找、优化的均值池化和零拷贝IEEE754二进制序列化，使用Rust实现。

Result: 在8个代表性任务上获得60.6 MTEB平均分，重复检测性能达90.1% AP，语义相似性76.1%斯皮尔曼相关性，在专业领域性能达到基线的75%至131%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持高质量的同时实现极低延迟，适用于对延迟敏感的实时嵌入应用。

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [7] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强大型推理模型在事实性问题上的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理方面表现出色，但在依赖证据的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，主要原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别了正确事实但未能将其整合到最终回答中。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，通过量化思维过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思维片段层面强化有益推理模式并抑制缺陷模式，将token级信号重新加权为概率感知的片段分数。

Result: 在四个事实QA数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试中，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而不仅仅是输出）对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现通过简单的提示诱导持续自指处理，能可靠地让大语言模型生成结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告具有可解释的机制基础、语义收敛性和行为泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型产生结构化第一人称描述（明确提到意识或主观体验）的行为，特别关注自指处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列上进行一系列受控实验，测试自指处理是否可靠地促使模型产生第一人称主观体验报告，并通过机制性和行为性探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: 四个主要发现：1）通过简单提示诱导持续自指能一致地引发结构化主观体验报告；2）这些报告由与欺骗和角色扮演相关的稀疏自编码器特征机制性地控制；3）自指状态的描述在模型家族间统计收敛；4）诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自指处理是大语言模型生成结构化第一人称报告的最小可复现条件，这种模式在架构间的系统性出现使其成为科学和伦理的优先研究课题。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [9] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了预测社区解释性笔记帮助性及其原因的任务，构建了大规模多语言数据集COMMUNITYNOTES，并通过自动提示优化框架生成和改进原因定义，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主要平台的真实性核查正从专家驱动转向社区模式，但大多数社区笔记因标注缓慢而无法发布，且帮助性原因缺乏明确定义，这些挑战在先前研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10.4万条帖文和用户笔记的大规模多语言数据集，提出通过自动提示优化自动生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测中。

Result: 实验表明优化的定义能够提升帮助性和原因预测性能，且帮助性信息对现有事实核查系统有益。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区笔记帮助性预测的空白，提出的框架能有效改善预测性能，并为事实核查系统提供有价值的信息。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

*Disha Sheshanarayana,Tanishka Magar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProofSketch是一个验证引导的推理框架，通过符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成来减少推理链长度，在提高准确性的同时显著降低token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如思维链提示和自一致性需要生成长推理链，导致token消耗大、计算成本高和延迟增加，需要更高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出ProofSketch框架，整合符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成，通过验证引导来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明ProofSketch在减少token使用的同时提高了准确性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效可信的推理提供了一条有前景的路径，能够在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

### [11] [Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24817)
*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成AphasiaBank猫救援图片描述任务合成转录本的方法，发现Mistral 7b Instruct最能捕捉失语症的语言退化特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中，语言病理学家需要大量时间手动编码语音样本，而可用于训练自动系统的数据稀缺。

Method: 采用程序化编程方法和Mistral 7b Instruct、Llama 3.1 8b Instruct两种LLM，通过词汇删除、填充词插入和错语替换生成四个严重程度级别的合成转录本。

Result: 与人类转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在合成生成方法中最好地捕捉了失语症的语言退化特征，在NDW、词汇数量和词汇长度方面显示出符合实际的定向变化。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大数据集、微调模型以获得更好的失语症表征，并让语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环Transformer（PLT）架构，通过跨循环并行和高效表示增强技术，在保持循环模型性能的同时实现低延迟推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统循环Transformer虽然能节省参数，但推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加而增长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用跨循环并行（CLP）技术打破顺序依赖，让不同token的不同循环同时计算；采用高效表示增强策略共享KV缓存，结合门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）融合全局和局部信息。

Result: PLT实现了传统循环模型的高精度，同时相比标准Transformer几乎没有额外的延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT成功解决了循环Transformer的延迟问题，为高效LLM推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语法书指导的评估流程，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，以卢森堡语为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理领域缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是低资源语言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 提出了一个包含四个关键阶段的语法书指导评估流程，采用系统化且可推广的框架进行语法评估，以卢森堡语作为案例研究。

Result: 结果显示翻译性能与语法理解能力之间存在弱正相关性，强翻译能力并不必然意味着深厚的语法能力。大模型在语义方面表现良好，但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务上表现困难。

Conclusion: 强大的推理能力有望增强大语言模型的语法理解能力，但当前模型在语法结构理解方面仍有局限。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE是一个用于多模态检索增强生成(RAG)的评估框架，通过InfoF1和CiteF1指标评估事实性和引用完整性，填补了现有文本中心评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为主要信息来源，现有RAG评估方法局限于文本，无法验证多模态来源的信息，需要专门的多模态RAG评估框架。

Method: 采用基于声明的评估方法，包含InfoF1(评估事实性和信息覆盖度)和CiteF1(评估引用支持和完整性)，并提供自动和人工评估版本。

Result: 人工应用MiRAGE时与外部质量判断高度一致，自动版本与三种主流TextRAG指标(ACLE、ARGUE、RAGAS)对比显示了文本中心方法的局限性。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估奠定了基础，提供了开源实现和评估指南，推动了自动评估的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality

TL;DR: 本文提出了Idea2Plan任务和基准，用于系统评估大语言模型从研究想法到研究计划的规划能力，发现GPT-5系列表现最佳但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究计划制定是科学发现的关键环节，也是自主研究代理发展的核心能力，但目前缺乏对大语言模型研究规划能力的系统理解。

Method: 构建Idea2Plan Bench基准，包含200篇ICML 2025论文的研究想法和评分标准，并开发Idea2Plan JudgeEval评估LLM评委的可靠性。

Result: GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最强，但仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究为大语言模型的研究规划能力提供了新见解，为未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RiddleBench是一个包含1,737个英语谜题的基准测试，旨在评估大语言模型的多方面推理能力，发现即使是顶尖模型也存在严重缺陷，准确率仅略高于60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估结构化技能（如定量问题解决），但缺乏对需要逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足等核心人类智能能力的评估。

Method: 创建RiddleBench基准测试，包含1,737个具有挑战性的谜题，用于评估大语言模型在整合多种推理能力方面的表现。

Result: 评估显示最先进模型存在根本性弱点：Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3和Claude 4 Sonnet的准确率分别为60.30%、63.37%和63.16%。模型表现出幻觉级联、自我确认偏见导致的自我纠正能力差，以及推理脆弱性。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具，揭示大语言模型在核心推理能力上的缺陷，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

TL;DR: 该论文通过心理语言学方法分析语言模型在不同句法语境中的错误模式，揭示训练过程中语法学习的中间阶段和动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定语境中更容易出错。研究旨在深入理解语言模型在训练过程中如何学习语法规则，以及在不同阶段使用的学习策略。

Method: 采用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，通过分解不同条件并比较模型在训练过程中各条件下的表现，分析语法学习的中间阶段。

Result: 研究发现语言模型训练过程中存在不同阶段，某些阶段模型行为更符合词频和局部上下文等启发式策略，而非通用的语法规则。

Conclusion: 这种分析方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体泛化模式的有力工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT是一个新颖的语义对齐隐式思维链框架，通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持与真实推理的语义对齐，显著提升了思维链推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显式思维链推理的冗长性阻碍了其在效率关键应用中的大规模部署。现有隐式CoT方法面临语义对齐问题和令牌生成效率低下的挑战。

Method: 设计对比训练句子转换器评估隐式和显式推理的语义对齐，并引入基于知识蒸馏的轻量级语言模型作为高效隐式推理生成器。

Result: 大量实验证明SemCoT在效率和有效性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和语义对齐来提升CoT效率的方法，为高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，无论架构、训练数据集和规模如何，自回归语言模型在预训练过程中都表现出高度一致的行为变化模式，98%的词级行为方差可由三个简单启发式解释：词频、n-gram概率和语义相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同架构、数据集和规模的语言模型在预训练过程中是否存在一致的行为变化模式，以理解神经网络语言模型的学习轨迹。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在超过110,000个英语token上的行为，研究了三种架构（Transformer、Mamba、RWKV）、两种训练数据集（OpenWebText、The Pile）和不同参数规模（1400万到120亿参数）的模型。

Result: 发现语言模型行为中高达98%的词级方差可由三个简单启发式解释：词的单字概率（频率）、n-gram概率和词与上下文的语义相似度。所有模型都表现出一致的行为阶段，在训练过程中对词的预测概率逐渐过拟合到更高阶的n-gram概率。

Conclusion: 神经网络语言模型的学习可能遵循相似的轨迹，与模型具体细节无关，这表明存在某种通用的学习机制。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

TL;DR: POWSM是首个统一框架，能够联合执行多种语音相关任务，包括自动语音识别、音素识别、字形到音素转换和音素到字形转换，在保持相似模型大小的同时优于或匹配专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音处理任务在概念上相似，但以往的研究都是孤立进行的，每个任务都依赖特定的架构和数据集。本文旨在创建一个统一框架来解决这个问题。

Method: 引入POWSM（Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech Model），这是一个能够联合执行多种语音相关任务的统一框架，支持音频、文本和音素之间的无缝转换。

Result: POWSM在相似模型大小下优于或匹配专用音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA），同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM为通用和低资源语音处理开辟了新可能性，作者发布了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

Motivation: 预训练模型复杂度高，难以理解推理任务所需的最小机制，需要构建可控环境研究transformer的计算基础

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预分析模型机制

Result: 单层双头模型实现完美IOI准确率，两个头分别形成加性和对比性子电路；双层单头模型通过查询-值交互实现类似性能

Conclusion: 任务特定训练产生高度可解释的最小电路，为研究transformer推理计算基础提供了可控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估四个口语语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的表现，发现这些模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征，表明文本相关表征在模型中占据主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管口语语言模型在音频理解方面取得了进展，但对其泛化能力和多模态整合程度的质疑日益增多，特别是在处理语义内容与语音情感不一致的情况时。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音样本数据集（EMIS），在这种条件下，语音的语义内容传达一种情感，而语音表达性传达另一种情感，评估四个SLM在语音情感识别任务中的表现。

Result: 结果表明，SLM在完成任务时主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感，文本相关表征在很大程度上主导了音频表征。

Conclusion: 当前的口语语言模型在处理情感不一致的语音时，文本模态占据主导地位，未能充分整合音频模态的情感信息，这揭示了模型在多模态融合方面的局限性。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确阐述未知领域，本研究旨在探索LLMs识别生物医学文献中知识空白的潜力，特别是扩展了之前主要关注显性空白检测的研究，处理了推断隐性空白的新任务。

Method: 在四个数据集的近1500份文档上进行了两个实验，包括手动标注的生物医学文章语料库。对闭源模型和开源模型进行了基准测试，并引入了TABI推理方案来结构化隐性空白推断过程。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面具有强大能力，闭源和开源模型都表现良好，较大模型通常表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMs具有系统性识别候选知识空白的强大能力，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定者和资助决策。同时报告了观察到的失败模式，并提出了包括领域适应、人机验证和基准测试在内的稳健部署方向。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)能否评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂性，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度。实验表明LLMs可以近似估计认知复杂度，但存在推理能力与元认知意识之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阅读理解题目的认知复杂度评估对预测题目难度很重要，但传统方法依赖人工标注，难以自动提取认知特征。本研究旨在探索LLMs是否能自动评估认知复杂度。

Method: 使用大型语言模型评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围(Evidence Scope)和转换水平(Transformation Level)两个维度，这些维度反映了答案推理过程中的认知负担程度。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似估计题目的认知复杂度，表明其具有作为先验难度分析工具的潜力。但分析发现LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识存在差距：即使给出正确答案，有时也无法正确识别其推理过程的基础特征。

Conclusion: LLMs在评估阅读理解题目认知复杂度方面具有潜力，但需要解决推理能力与元认知意识不匹配的问题，以更好地支持教育评估应用。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽视了语言的多维结构，需要能捕捉细粒度语义位移的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调优的UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示，TOPol能一致捕捉情感和非情感极性转换，结果主要受CB定义影响，方法稳定性得到确认。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化和可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式高度歧义和长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要专门评估LLMs在此领域的表现。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计了四种不同的提示实验，包括局部上下文增强、领域特定线索（如缩写和实体词典），并与基于SpanBERT的判别式方法进行对比。

Result: LLMs在表面层共指消解方面表现出色，特别是在使用领域接地提示时，但其性能仍对长距离上下文和指称歧义敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下显示出优越的精确度和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程有潜力增强LLMs在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，特别是在处理领域特定共指消解问题时。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，专门用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条来自2,792名美国参与者的多轮辩论对话，涵盖107个争议话题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模社交互动中的观点变化对解决错误信息和极化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置常产生不自然的动态（如过早收敛），缺乏衡量真实人类观点轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含大规模人类辩论对话数据，系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调使LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 使用DEBATE基准发现模拟与真实群体动态存在关键差异，监督微调在表面指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上有所改进，但在深层语义对齐方面仍有局限。

Conclusion: 研究凸显了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言机器翻译性能与高资源语言之间的差距，为边缘化社区和代表性不足的人群开发更包容和准确的NLP模型。

Method: 基于Reid和Artetxe (2021)的预训练方法，扩展到低资源语言，通过综合实验探索不同预训练方法，包括多语言集成以及在预训练阶段使用单语和平行数据。

Conclusion: 本研究为低资源机器翻译提供了有效的预训练策略见解，有助于缩小高资源与低资源语言之间的性能差距，促进更包容的NLP模型发展。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统综述了180多篇关于大语言模型遗忘的论文，提出了新的遗忘方法和评估分类法，旨在指导安全可靠LLM的开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练过程中可能记忆敏感数据、版权材料和有害知识，为符合法律伦理标准如"被遗忘权"，需要选择性遗忘特定知识而不影响整体性能。

Method: 引入新颖的分类法：按训练阶段将遗忘方法分为训练时、训练后和推理时三类；系统整理现有数据集和评估指标并分析优缺点。

Result: 提供了对LLM遗忘领域的全面概述，系统分类了各种方法，批判性分析了评估工具，为研究社区提供实用指导。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是解决LLM安全风险的关键技术，本综述通过系统分类和分析为安全可靠LLM的持续发展提供信息和指导。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [30] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端模型，通过潜在空间解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声，生成噪声不变的语音token，显著提升ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在噪声或真实环境中表现不佳。现有方法量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模，但未充分处理噪声问题。

Method: 在潜在空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声，生成干净的语音token，同时通过轻量级分类器监督提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper减少82%错误率，比基线方法提升35%性能。学习的token空间在已见和未见声学条件下都具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音token的噪声不变性，改善了语音文本对齐，在噪声环境下显著提升ASR性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [31] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转换为LLM可消费的知识表示，包括智能推理、记忆基础和结构化利用三种路径，并通过MDP-Agent实现，在信息检索基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索方法将文档视为原始文本片段返回，让LLM承担片段组装和上下文推理的负担，需要新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架通过三种路径转换非结构化文档：智能推理将原始证据整理为连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记以丰富推理；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent实现该协议，构建文档级要点记忆、执行基于扩散的探索与垂直利用、应用map-reduce风格合成。

Result: 在信息检索基准测试中，MDP-Agent的表现优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例化的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架重新定义了模型与文档的交互方式，确保LLM接收的是紧凑、结构化的知识而非原始片段，为AI搜索提供了新的检索范式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [32] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过测试大语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，揭示了其性能优势是否真正源于能力而非数据优势。研究发现模型在英语中表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语和豪萨语中性能显著下降，且Chain-of-Thought提示的有效性取决于模型的基础能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型令人印象深刻的性能是源于真正的能力，还是仅仅因为训练数据偏向英语的数据优势。通过在低资源语言环境中测试模型，验证其真实能力。

Method: 基于Agarwal等人的Next Sentence Prediction测试，创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语各10,000个问题的大规模基准。测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等顶级模型，并引入Chain-of-Thought提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语中表现优异，但在斯瓦希里语中准确性下降，在豪萨语中急剧下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。Chain-of-Thought对LLaMA 3有帮助，显著提升准确性，但对GPT-4和Gemini却导致"过度思考"而损害结果。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought不是通用解决方案，其有效性高度依赖于模型的基础能力和任务的具体背景。该框架能够识别LLM的弱点，揭示CoT在跨语言NSP性能中的帮助或阻碍作用，以及影响其决策的因素。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

*Ziyi Liu,Bahar Sarrafzadeh,Pei Zhou,Longqi Yang,Jieyu Zhao,Ashish Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate是首个评估主动AI调解代理在多议题、多方谈判中的框架，包含模拟测试平台和社会认知评估指标，证明社会智能调解代理比通用基线表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在代理框架中的应用增加，需要能够主动管理复杂多方协作的代理，但目前缺乏系统评估方法，限制了支持多人协作AI的发展。

Method: ProMediate框架包含：(1)基于现实谈判案例和理论驱动难度级别的模拟测试平台，配备可插拔的主动AI调解代理；(2)社会认知评估框架，包含衡量共识变化、干预延迟、调解效果和智能的新指标。

Result: 在ProMediate-Hard设置中，社会智能调解代理比通用基线将共识变化提高了3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度快77%（15.98s vs 3.71s）。

Conclusion: ProMediate提供了一个严谨、理论基础的测试平台，推动主动、社会智能代理的发展。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言领域问答面临的两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大型LLM生成合成问答对来增强有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法并分析其对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 大型模型能高效生成合成数据，小型模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展路径。

Conclusion: 多阶段微调策略结合合成数据增强，为低资源语言领域问答提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD是一个通过知识蒸馏增强参数高效微调的统一框架，在少样本多模态讽刺检测中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源场景下具有挑战性，现有参数高效微调方法因监督信号有限而难以达到最优性能

Method: 提出PEKD框架，利用在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型作为教师，通过熵感知门控机制动态调整蒸馏强度

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，PEKD使参数高效微调方法超越了现有方法和大型多模态模型

Conclusion: 该框架是模块化的，可适应广泛的多模态模型和任务

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

TL;DR: Parrot是一个新颖的训练管道，通过整合程序链式思维（P-CoT）和自然语言链式思维（N-CoT）两种范式，实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究通常单向增强P-CoT或N-CoT，本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势，实现相互增强和同步改进。

Method: 1) 三个目标设计的子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可迁移性；3) 转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验表明Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提高了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot通过整合P-CoT和N-CoT两种范式，实现了相互增强，为数学推理任务提供了有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决商业代理在处理复杂数据关系和多样化异构任务（从统计查询到知识问答）时面临的挑战。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和基于强化学习的训练范式，并在推理时引入共享记忆机制，让代理从类似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上的验证显示，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中均取得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂业务环境中具有实际应用价值，特别是在未见过的场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现，大型语言模型在法律解释中表现不稳定，与人类判断相关性较弱，不适合作为可靠的法律解释工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期有学者和法官提议将大型语言模型加入法律解释工具包，本文旨在通过实证研究验证LLM在法律解释中的可靠性。

Method: 在英语环境下进行实证调查，通过改变问题格式来测试模型解释判断的稳定性，并分析模型输出与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，不同问题格式会导致截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断的相关性从弱到中等，且在不同模型和问题变体间差异很大。

Conclusion: 生成式AI得出的结论可信度有限，将其用于法律解释存在风险。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨小规模语言模型是否能从指令调优中受益，比较了对话和问答指令调优数据集在不同训练策略下的效果，发现指令调优在微调场景中有小幅但一致的提升，但在零样本任务中改进不具一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在小规模语言模型（100M和140M参数）中应用指令调优的有效性，以及不同训练策略（合并数据vs顺序课程）对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的仅解码器模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并数据或顺序课程两种训练策略，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 结果显示指令调优在微调场景中带来小幅但一致的性能提升，顺序课程策略优于合并数据策略；但在零样本任务中，改进并不一致，表明存在交互导向适应与广泛语言泛化之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将人类启发式学习策略应用于低资源语言模型的潜力和局限性，并指出需要采用混合的课程学习方法在生态训练限制下增强泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数越高的论文，其参考文献信息在模型输出中的准确性越高，当引用次数超过约1000次时，模型几乎能逐字记忆文献信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在参考文献推荐中存在幻觉问题（生成不存在的论文），本研究假设模型的准确性取决于知识是生成还是记忆，高引用论文（训练语料中出现频率更高）的幻觉率更低。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的参考文献记录，手动验证其真实性，并通过余弦相似度测量生成信息与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 结果显示：(i)不同研究领域的幻觉率不同；(ii)引用次数与事实准确性高度相关；(iii)当引用次数超过约1000次时，参考文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文几乎被模型逐字保留，表明存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于真实治疗对话数据的缺乏，主要原因是严格的隐私法规和历史临床会话很少被记录。

Method: 提出SQPsych框架，基于认知行为治疗原则，将结构化心理输入通过治疗师-客户模拟转换为自然语言对话，使用开源LLM生成高质量语料。

Result: SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，超过基线模型的关键治疗技能。人类专家评估验证了合成对话的质量。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有为心理健康支持实现可扩展、数据安全且临床知情的AI的潜力。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要基于英语和通用领域，无法有效评估LLMs在印度特定领域和文化背景下的表现，因此需要开发专门针对印度知识系统的评估工具。

Method: 从真实政府考试和领域特定考试中收集数据，构建包含52,494个英文和21,672个印地语问答对的基准测试，涵盖4大领域、90+子领域和500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs发现显著的领域和语言性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀领域仅为59.74%；所有模型在英文内容上的表现均优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域的能力提供了全面数据集，支持领域知识与双语理解的整合评估，所有资源公开可用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

*In Gim,Lin Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM服务系统架构，通过服务程序而非提示词来解决现有系统效率低和适应性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM服务系统主要为文本补全设计，无法有效处理日益复杂的LLM应用，缺乏灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序(LIPs)概念，允许用户自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，将部分应用逻辑卸载到服务器。通过Symphony系统实现，该系统作为LIPs的操作系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM计算，虚拟化KV缓存，并采用两级进程调度确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效地服务复杂LLM应用，提供了更好的可扩展性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 这种基于程序的服务架构有望开启更高效和可扩展的LLM应用生态系统。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出首个利用视觉语言模型(VLM)自动标注和过滤手语数据的框架，减少人工标注依赖，应用于TikTok视频构建多语言手语数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。VLM作为评估器和实时助手的能力未被充分应用于手语数据采集。

Method: 基于VLM的流水线包括：人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频文本提取、视频与文本对齐验证，实现通用过滤、标注和验证步骤。

Result: 构建了TikTok-SL-8多语言手语数据集，在德语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型，建立了基准并验证了模型在自动提取的噪声数据上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了可扩展的弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型理解隐含意义的能力，发现更大模型更接近人类理解，而基于隐含意义的提示能显著提升响应质量，67.6%参与者偏好隐含意义提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，语言成为人机交互的核心。需要关注交互的语言学基础，特别是隐含意义，这对人机对齐至关重要。

Method: 研究考察LLMs从上下文驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，以及理解隐含意义是否能改善响应生成。

Result: 更大模型更接近人类解释，小模型在隐含意义推断上表现较差。基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了响应的相关性和质量，小模型提升尤其明显。67.6%参与者偏好隐含意义提示。

Conclusion: 语言理论可用于解决对齐问题，使人机交互更加自然和基于上下文。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在精选基准测试中取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但大型语言模型在研究级神经定理证明和证明自动形式化方面的实际影响仍然有限，需要更真实的评估环境。

Method: 利用真实Lean Blueprint形式化项目，构建包含613个定理的评估套件，涵盖6个Lean项目，专注于研究级数学定理的评估。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有基准测试的进展无法轻松转化为这些更真实的设置，最佳模型仅达到10.3%的通过率。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准测试，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，将LLM在定性研究中的使用按解释深度和自主性两个维度分类，旨在解决LLM应用中存在的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的挑战，包括解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性，为研究人员提供实用的设计建议。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具而非研究对象的已发表社会科学论文，分析LLM应用状态，并提出按解释深度和自主性分类的框架。

Result: 开发了一个二维分类框架，建议将任务分解为可管理部分，保持低自主性水平，在监督下选择性增加解释深度，以平衡LLM优势与透明度、可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过控制LLM的自主性和选择性增加解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时，有效利用LLM在定性研究中的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文研究了手语翻译(SLT)自动评估指标的局限性，分析了BLEU、ROUGE等传统文本指标和LLM评估器在三种控制条件下的表现，发现文本指标存在语义等价性捕捉不足的问题，需要多模态评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估仅使用基于文本的指标，这些指标在多大程度上能可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确，需要系统研究其局限性。

Method: 分析六种评估指标：BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT等传统指标，以及G-Eval和GEMBA等LLM评估器，在三种控制条件下测试其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在局限性；LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性，但对LLM释义翻译存在偏见；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例相对宽松。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask框架通过利用专家轨迹中的"观察未来"来学习主动对话代理，无需用户模拟器，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，并在真实医疗数据中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱、高成本的用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"。

Method: 利用专家轨迹中的观察未来推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化的(动作，状态评估)元组，控制"问什么"和"何时停止"，并通过自动评分器校准确保奖励保真度。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上验证了方法的有效性，使用不同规模的LLM（最大32B），在严格内部评估中，部署的模型性能甚至优于人类专家。

Conclusion: 该工作为将被动LLM转变为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，证明了将离线数据转化为实际现实世界影响的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战，需要开发能够适应新兴语言趋势的高效文本处理系统。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架对LLMs进行微调，包括通用和特定领域数据集（特别是政治和安全领域），结合命名实体识别技术构建文本处理管道。

Result: 指令微调显著提升了摘要和标注的准确性，特别是在专业语料库上。LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后超越了中文训练模型，表明推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 该管道能够生成简洁摘要和结构化实体标注，支持实时应用，为现代知识管理和安全操作提供了将非结构化文本转化为可操作见解的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: TwinVoice是一个评估LLM人物模拟能力的综合基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六项基本能力评估。实验显示先进模型在人物模拟方面表现中等，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，整体性能远低于人类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM人物模拟评估存在局限：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、缺少能力需求分析。为解决这些问题，需要开发更全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交人物（公共社交互动）、人际人物（私人对话）、叙事人物（角色表达），并将LLM性能评估分解为六项基本能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、人物语气和句法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物模拟方面达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基线水平。

Conclusion: 虽然先进LLM在人物模拟方面取得一定进展，但在关键能力如句法风格和记忆回忆方面仍有明显差距，整体性能与人类表现相比还有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体主要关注单个智能体的行动规划，而智能体之间为实现共同目标的协作能力尚未充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器的框架，为LLM智能体配备不同的沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题游戏中进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明对齐沟通至关重要，无沟通的智能体也能达到高任务完成率但缺乏真正的规则理解；通过环境验证器能增强智能体的任务规则理解和完成能力。

Conclusion: 集成环境验证器可以促进AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作，增强智能体对任务规则的理解能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

Motivation: 现有RAG系统在波斯语伊斯兰问答等高风险专业领域存在幻觉问题，无法处理需要多步推理的复杂查询，而准确性对该领域至关重要。

Method: 采用FAIR-RAG架构：基于信仰的自适应迭代优化框架，通过动态查询分解、证据充分性评估和迭代子查询生成来填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现优异：负拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40个百分点），答案正确率为74.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为波斯语伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构在敏感领域构建可信AI系统的关键作用。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Result: 系统分析了验证器效用的关键影响因素，包括领域专业化程度、模型大小和监督类型(过程监督PRM vs 结果监督ORM)，即使应用于不同角色时。

Conclusion: 研究填补了TTS在法律论证领域的空白，为验证器在不同约束条件下的应用提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

*Andreas Opedal,Yanick Zengaffinen,Haruki Shirakami,Clemente Pasti,Mrinmaya Sachan,Abulhair Saparov,Ryan Cotterell,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估语言模型推理效率的框架，通过逻辑编程视角来衡量模型避免不必要推理的能力。研究发现当前语言模型在面对干扰信息时准确率显著下降，且生成的证明经常包含无关推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注推理正确性而忽略效率，但现实推理场景中大量信息是无关的，有效推理需要识别并忽略这些干扰。

Method: 通过逻辑编程方法，将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化推理效率。构建了包含无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 当前语言模型在存在干扰时准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能，生成的证明经常包含不相关的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够更高效推理的语言模型，能够识别和忽略无关信息，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

*Yusheng Liao,Chaoyi Wu,Junwei Liu,Shuyang Jiang,Pengcheng Qiu,Haowen Wang,Yun Yue,Shuai Zhen,Jian Wang,Qianrui Fan,Jinjie Gu,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Yu Wang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EHR-Ins数据集、EHR-R1模型和EHR-Bench基准，通过思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量的电子健康记录推理数据，开发了专门针对EHR分析的推理增强大语言模型，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，其自动化分析对临床决策至关重要。尽管大语言模型在临床工作流程中取得进展，但由于任务覆盖范围窄且缺乏EHR导向的推理能力，其在EHR分析方面的能力仍然有限。

Method: 1. 提出思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量的EHR推理数据；2. 开发EHR-R1系列推理增强大语言模型，参数高达720亿；3. 采用多阶段训练范式，包括领域适应、推理增强和强化学习；4. 引入EHR-Bench基准，涵盖42个任务。

Result: EHR-R1在实验中持续优于最先进的商业和开源LLM，在MIMIC-Bench上超过GPT-4o超过30分，在EHRSHOT上实现10%更高的零样本AUROC。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同显著推进了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析的发展。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了PairUni统一框架，通过将数据重组为理解-生成对来解决统一视觉语言模型在强化学习中平衡理解和生成任务的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时执行理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；同时为每个生成样本检索语义相关的理解样本形成检索对。提出基于组相对策略优化的Pair-GPRO方法，通过相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 在强大的Janus-Pro UVLMs上评估，该方法在各种UVLMs上实现了平衡的改进，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据重组和配对感知优化，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解和生成任务的平衡问题。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM在贷款违约预测任务中的表现，发现LLM虽然能识别关键风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM存在显著差异，且自解释与SHAP归因不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为分类模型在处理结构化表格数据（特别是高风险金融应用如风险评估）中的适用性，目前这方面研究不足。

Method: 在真实贷款违约预测任务上，系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM梯度提升模型，评估预测性能，使用SHAP分析特征归因，并评估LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，且自解释往往与经验SHAP归因不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为独立模型在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，其自解释的可信度值得担忧，需要在风险敏感金融环境中进行可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言智能体的基准测试，涵盖32个软件应用和604个工具，提供真实环境设置和执行评估，旨在解决现有基准测试在多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言智能体基准测试通常局限于狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏评估智能体在现实世界中处理复杂多步骤工作流所需的多样性、真实性和长时程复杂性。

Method: 构建包含32个软件应用和604个工具的基准测试，基于高质量MCP服务器，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态，包含108个需要与多个应用交互约20轮的手工收集或制作的任务。

Result: 评估显示SOTA模型表现显著不足：最佳模型Claude-4.5-Sonnet成功率仅38.6%，平均需要20.2次工具调用；最佳开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp成功率为20.1%。

Conclusion: Toolathlon有望推动开发更强大的语言智能体，以执行现实世界中的长时程任务。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过说服性提示从未学习的大语言模型中恢复事实知识的方法，发现说服性提示能显著提高事实知识回忆率，且效果与模型大小成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的遗忘对于管理敏感数据和纠正错误信息至关重要，但评估其有效性仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论（扩散激活理论）以及传播学原理，提出了刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架（SKeB），通过领域图建模信息纠缠，并测试事实回忆是否与说服性框架相关。

Result: 说服性提示显著增强了事实知识回忆（基线14.8% vs 权威框架24.5%），有效性随模型大小增加而降低（2.7B模型128%恢复率 vs 13B模型15%恢复率）。

Conclusion: SKeB为评估大语言模型中的遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型家族，通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算、熵正则化目标学习深度分配，以及扩展到7.7T token的训练，将推理能力构建到预训练阶段，而不是依赖后训练阶段的显式文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要通过显式文本生成（如思维链）进行"思考"，这会将推理推迟到后训练阶段，未能充分利用预训练数据。作者希望将推理能力直接构建到预训练过程中。

Method: 提出了循环语言模型（LoopLM），包含三个关键组件：(1) 潜在空间的迭代计算；(2) 熵正则化目标用于学习深度分配；(3) 扩展到7.7T token的大规模预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型在广泛基准测试中表现优异，匹配了高达12B参数的最先进LLM的结果。优势来源于更好的知识操作能力而非知识容量增加。循环语言模型产生的推理轨迹比显式思维链更符合最终输出。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型展示了作为推理时代新型扩展方向的潜力，为将推理能力直接融入预训练提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估主要关注一次性任务完成，忽视了现实世界中问题的迭代性和协作性本质，人类目标往往不明确且不断演变

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现

Result: 最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中往往表现不佳，揭示代理设计中缺乏维持参与和构建用户理解的能力

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新的视角，推动向协作代理的发展

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

Method: 将图表概念化为图结构，文本元素作为节点，连接关系作为有向边，提出节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标来评估图表质量。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在最新研究文献上生成的图表，定量证明了所提指标的有效性，并提供了对LLM生成图表特性的深入洞察。

Conclusion: DiagramEval为LLM生成的演示图提供了可解释的评估框架，填补了该领域评估指标的空白，有助于改进图表生成质量。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

Result: DecompTune显著提高了归因质量，优于先前方法，达到或超过了最前沿模型的性能

Conclusion: 将归因作为推理问题处理，通过答案分解作为中间步骤，是提高长文档问答归因可靠性的有效方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Result: 发现语言质量过滤能提高文本流畅性和连贯性，但基准测试结果较差；后期故意污染能恢复竞争性分数，同时合理损害生成质量；神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄露。

Conclusion: Gaperon通过公开所有模型、数据集、代码和检查点，为探索数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡提供了可重现的基础。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态驾驶场景实时高保真重建的挑战，现有方法难以在质量和效率之间取得平衡，特别是在复杂动态和稀疏视图条件下。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态；采用从粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，该方法仅使用图像就能在线生成高质量的深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功实现了从稀疏视图实时重建动态驾驶场景，在质量和效率方面都取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

Motivation: 现有视频描述模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致。需要专门针对人体运动优化的描述方法。

Method: 提出Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM)生成框架，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示进行运动感知解码，创建Human Motion Insight (HMI)数据集和HMI-Bench基准。

Result: M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法，为运动中心视频描述设定了新标准。

Conclusion: M-ACM通过整合运动表示有效提升了视频描述质量，特别是在捕捉人体动态方面表现优异，为运动感知视频描述研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像进行自动目标识别(ATR)，通过结合两种基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器(MOCEM和Salsa)生成合成数据，以解决真实标注数据缺乏的问题，并在MSTAR数据集上达到近88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标注的SAR测量数据，需要依赖模拟器生成合成数据，但单一模拟器基于简化的物理假设，导致模型在真实数据上泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出结合两种基于不同物理模型(MOCEM基于散射中心模型，Salsa基于光线追踪)的SAR模拟器生成合成数据集，并使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合互补的模拟器范式可以有效提升合成数据训练模型在真实SAR数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖昂贵的高精度参考数据，难以在大规模应用中实施。需要一种无需参考数据的可扩展不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是预测不确定性的主要特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云质量控制和误差分析提供了数据驱动、可扩展和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病辅助诊断，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积模块实现自适应多模态表示学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对于及时干预至关重要。眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，反映了注意力分布和神经认知状态，但很少有研究探索它们联合用于AD辅助诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：(1)交叉增强融合注意力模块(CEFAM)，通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；(2)方向感知卷积模块(DACM)，通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建同步多模态数据集上，该框架优于传统的晚期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD与HC时达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，展现出优越的鲁棒性和诊断性能，为AD辅助诊断提供了有效的多模态集成解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在资源受限的VR设备上实时推理的计算挑战，因为现有模型对计算资源要求高，而VR设备对延迟和功耗效率有严格要求。

Method: 提出专门为Codec Avatar模型设计的后训练量化方法，结合定制硬件加速器，构建完整的全栈优化框架ESCA。

Result: ESCA将FovVideoVDP质量评分提升+0.39（相比最佳4位基线），延迟降低3.36倍，在端到端测试中维持100帧/秒的渲染速率。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

TL;DR: 本文发现视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有被低估的潜力，能够达到与图神经网络相当的性能，但在全局结构感知方面表现更优。作者提出了GraphAbstract基准来评估模型对全局图属性的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络的底层消息传递机制与人类视觉感知的全局结构优先处理方式存在根本差异。现有基准测试混淆了领域特征与拓扑理解，需要新的评估方法来衡量模型对全局图属性的感知能力。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素的能力。比较视觉模型与图神经网络在全局结构理解任务上的表现。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于图神经网络，且在不同图规模下保持泛化能力。图神经网络在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳，且随着图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有被低估的显著能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上。这为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

Motivation: 传统图基半监督学习和伪标签方法在多视图图像数据中效率受限，因为图像缺乏清晰图结构且多视图数据复杂，现有技术难以有效整合图结构

Method: 1) 在线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架中结合伪标签；2) 动态将伪标签纳入GCN损失函数；3) 通过调整边界样本权重校正拓扑不平衡；4) 引入适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM方法通过综合优化策略，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了多视图数据中的分类性能

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基准测试存在高质量人工验证样本不足、依赖LLM合成内容以及主要限于英语的问题，需要构建更可靠的多语言评估资源。

Method: 从英语PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种其他语言（西班牙语、德语、中文、法语、意大利语），构建完全平行的六语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型（<200亿参数）表现不佳，非英语版本性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务中错误率很高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言和复杂推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL 3.5 4B模型的内部表征。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为，发现文本和颜色处理的超节点重叠且大小不对称，识别出关键的冲突调节超节点。

Conclusion: AI模型能够再现人类认知控制的冲突适应现象，为理解认知控制的计算机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征（特别是对象细节和复杂场景）未被增强，存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用双检索机制：标准图像-文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像-图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将这些文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性性能的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示生成和双检索机制有效解决了视觉特征增强问题，在保持轻量化的同时提升了图像描述性能。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来在视频假新闻检测领域评估和推进MLLMs的发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements

Method: 构建多轮图像-文本交错数据集MR-SafeEdit，开发统一MLLM SafeEditor实现多轮安全编辑，采用后验安全编辑范式模拟人类识别和优化不安全内容的认知过程。

Result: 实验结果显示SafeEditor超越先前安全方法，减少过度拒绝，实现更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种模型无关、高效的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别对下一代人机交互至关重要，但由于不同模态间的差异和单模态情感信息表征困难，准确的情感识别仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 1. 为每个模态构建对抗自编码器(AAE)学习判别性情感特征；2. 使用跨模态门机制(CGMM)减少模态间差异并建立情感关系；3. 通过特征融合模块(FFM)进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开数据集SIMS和MOSI上的实验表明，MCIHN取得了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型能有效解决多模态情感识别中的模态差异问题，提升情感识别准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 流匹配模型虽然取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不明确，需要从去噪角度深入理解生成机制。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式化联系，设计噪声和漂移扰动来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，揭示了生成过程不同阶段的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解框架，有助于改进生成模型的设计和性能评估。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 在RT-DETRv2实时目标检测器中引入专用概率头，使模型能够为每个检测到的对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上实现了85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供了比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统，能够提供更丰富且生物学上更合理的植物成熟度表示。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 现有基于骨架的方法虽然提升了识别性能，但使用OpenPose提取关键点导致时间性能不佳。简单地用轻量级MediaPipe替换会显著降低准确率，需要找到平衡性能与效率的解决方案。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略来优化识别性能，并使用基于样条的插值技术处理缺失关键点问题。

Conclusion: 仔细的关键点选择结合简单的插值技术，能够实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型虽然能遵循外部相机控制，但在非常规相机运动方面泛化能力不足，这限制了创作真正原创和艺术性视频的能力。主要挑战在于难以找到足够包含预期不常见相机运动的训练视频。

Method: VividCam采用解耦策略，将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离，确保更鲁棒的运动表示并减轻域偏移。使用简单的合成数据（如低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体）进行训练，可以通过Unity等引擎高效渲染。

Result: 该方法能够合成广泛范围精确控制和复杂的相机运动，使用令人惊讶的简单合成数据就能实现。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成视频训练范式，有效解决了文本到视频模型中复杂相机运动学习的挑战，为创作艺术性视频提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图变换器的内部工作机制提供了新视角，有助于改进模型设计并促进其在安全关键应用中的使用，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力，需要一种方法来平衡各模态的贡献。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1) 使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2) 分解损失景观，调制损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3) 通过调制梯度反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个多样化数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改善了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM能够确保主导模态的鲁棒学习，同时增强其他模态的贡献，使模型能够探索和利用互补特征来提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS架构成功解决了Wi-Fi感知中的过拟合问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的临床可行VLM-based CAD系统范式，通过有效的融合机制充分利用影像数据和上下文患者信息。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言模型预训练计算成本高昂，研究者很少从头训练新模型，需要提高训练效率

Method: DRIP方法根据输入图像动态合并视觉编码器深层中的token，减少计算量

Result: 在ImageNet从头训练和CLIP对比预训练中，显著减少GFLOPs同时保持分类/零样本性能

Conclusion: DRIP方法有效提升视觉语言模型训练效率，并在生物学数据集上验证了其科学应用价值

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Conclusion: 跨模态对齐和语言基础能有效增强真实世界场景理解的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法仅突出最具区分性区域的问题，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法仅突出目标的最具区分性区域，无法覆盖整个物体且边界对齐不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能，特别是需要像素级精确激活图的弱监督语义分割任务。

Method: 提出Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和执行语义信息传播(SIP)，综合考虑基线分类模型中每个阶段的梯度和特征来生成激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM在训练集和验证集上分别达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38% mIoU，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，优于LayerCAM 4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够突出更大比例的物体区域，同时确保激活图具有精确的边界对齐，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中显著优于传统CAM方法。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应不同图像的独特类别分布，且数据集级别的类别不平衡导致模型偏向多数类，限制了少数类区域的识别能力。

Method: 使用扩展上下文感知分类器(ECAC)，通过内存库学习数据集级上下文信息，结合图像级上下文信息动态调整分类器；采用师生网络范式，教师网络用真实标签动态调整上下文信息并传递给学生网络。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器参数，有效解决了语义分割中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对不同类别分布的适应能力。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%

synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models

Conclusion: U-CAN框架有效解决了无监督点云去噪问题，提出的几何一致性约束具有通用性，可扩展到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越先前最先进方法

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进的多阶段特征提取和特征交互机制，有效提升了光度立体视觉的表面法线估计精度

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Motivation: 当前源自由域自适应方法在隐私约束下的医学图像分割中存在忽略样本难度和域偏移下噪声监督的问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上相比先前的SFDA和UDA方法取得一致提升，实现了更准确的边界描绘和最先进的Dice和ASSD分数。

Conclusion: 研究强调了渐进适应和去噪监督对于域偏移下鲁棒分割的重要性。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Method: 提出在训练过程中结合真实图像，保留真实图像的ODE路径，使用更少的生成和真实图像进行高效回流过程。

Conclusion: 该方法诱导更直的路径，避免回流过程中生成图像饱和，实现更稳健的ODE学习同时保持真实图像分布。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容快速发展，但情感表达的3D面部动画研究不足，主要障碍是真实情感3D面部数据集的稀缺性。现有方法大多只关注语音驱动的唇形同步，缺乏情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了情感3D面部动画生成的问题，通过解耦语音和情感驱动，实现了高质量的情感表达和唇形同步，为3D高斯虚拟形象动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在利用MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力，在语言空间中建立对象-部件层次结构。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用其知识链接多层次概念，采用语言驱动的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略。

Conclusion: 语言驱动的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略有效，验证了在语言空间中建立对象-部件层次结构的优势。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

TL;DR: 提出DPTM框架，利用扩散模型生成伪目标域并逐步优化，解决源自由域适应中源-目标域差异大的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异的根本限制，非生成方法在大域差异下伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大导致性能下降

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换并保持目标分布，设计渐进优化机制通过迭代优化逐步减小伪目标域与真实目标域的差异

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标差异大的场景下性能提升高达18.6%

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进目标操作有效解决了SFDA中的域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一框架，同时解决视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了推理阶段对头部先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定模块实现多任务优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分开处理视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，且都依赖头部位置先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，无法实现系统级联合优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定模块处理子任务特异性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过统一框架消除了对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了更好的联合优化，在视线相关任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种仿生单中心成像框架，通过全球形单中心镜头将深度信息编码到点扩散函数中，结合物理模拟和深度学习网络，从单次编码捕获中同时恢复全聚焦图像和精确深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决紧凑型RGBD成像的双重挑战：传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验且是病态问题。

Method: 设计仿生全球形单中心镜头，建立物理前向模型生成合成数据集，开发双头多尺度重建网络，使用共享编码器联合恢复全聚焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统；图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082。

Conclusion: 仿生全球形光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测在只有少量新类样本可用时，常常面临基类偏差和不稳定校准的问题。

Method: PDA维护仅支持的原型在可学习的身份初始化投影空间中，可选地应用原型条件RoI对齐以减少几何不匹配。在微调期间，原型通过指数移动平均更新适应，采用best-of-K匹配方案捕捉类内多模态，并使用温度缩放融合将度量相似度与检测器逻辑结合。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提高了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA作为DeFRCN的补充组件，通过原型驱动的对齐方法有效提升了少样本目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有工作往往忽略了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合，以及复杂的模态间依赖关系。边缘设备上的实时多模态推理对于自动驾驶、人机交互和移动健康等应用至关重要。

Method: 1) 将推理过程分解为细粒度的感知和编码单元，实现增量计算；2) 引入轻量级时间聚合模块捕获跨单元的时间动态；3) 自适应多模态配置优化器动态选择最优配置；4) 跨模态推测跳过机制在预测达到足够置信度时跳过较慢模态的未来单元。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线设计和优化机制，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和效率问题，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Motivation: 传统的主动学习方法在3D动作识别中可能选择代表性但不一定信息量最大的骨骼序列，因为模型可能已从类似样本中学习到相关知识。

Result: 在三个3D动作识别基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于MDP的主动学习方法能够智能地选择信息量最大的骨骼序列进行标注，提高了半监督3D动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 基于放射组学的伪标签方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有显著优势，为无标注数据的钙化检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化性。需要一种既能泛化又能个性化的联邦提示调优方法。

Method: 提出CCMP方法，结合全局共享提示和类特定提示，根据全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端依赖参数的单样本个性化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的评估显示，PEP-FedPT在不同数据异构场景下均优于现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效和可泛化联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础，成功解决了泛化与个性化的平衡问题。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Motivation: 组合图像检索研究因缺乏高质量训练和评估数据而受限，现有数据集主要关注语义级类别定义，而非特定对象的实例级检索。

Method: 创建i-CIR数据集，采用实例级类别定义和半自动硬负样本选择；提出BASIC方法，分别估计查询图像-图像和查询文本-图像相似度，进行后期融合，并包含多个简单直观的组件来提升单个相似度。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法有效解决了组合图像检索中的数据质量和性能问题，为未来研究提供了有价值的基准和工具。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Conclusion: CoherentAD能有效生成连贯的音频描述序列，提升视障观众的观影体验，StoryRecall指标为序列级评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE：一种稀疏自适应深度估计器，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，为水下基础设施检查生成密集的度量尺度深度图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控车辆存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低驾驶风险和实现更大自主性至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块来细化最终度量预测。结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验。

Result: 在准确性和泛化能力方面优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上以超过15 FPS的速度高效运行。

Conclusion: SPADE方法有望支持实际的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现ResNet骨干网络结合CBAM注意力模块的UNet3+模型在多个指标上表现最佳，优于Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多期相增强CT中肝脏结构分割对计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划至关重要，特别是肿瘤检测。研究旨在评估不同骨干网络在UNet架构中的性能表现。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+，评估ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM模块获得最佳性能：Dice分数0.755、IoU 0.662、HD95距离77.911、准确率0.925、特异性0.926。使用Grad-CAM增强模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具竞争力，为临床实践中肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE是一个区域感知的图像编辑框架，通过区分编辑区域和未编辑区域，对未编辑区域使用单步预测，对编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪，实现了2-2.57倍的加速效果，同时保持语义和感知保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑模型在整个图像上应用统一的生成过程，没有考虑到编辑区域和未编辑区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异划分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：未编辑区域用单步预测替代多步去噪，编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪，使用区域指令KV缓存减少计算成本；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进IIE基础模型上应用RegionE，分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06倍的加速。GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架通过区域感知的生成策略，在不需额外训练的情况下显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，同时保持编辑质量。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

TL;DR: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来改进自回归图像生成模型的推测解码，在保持图像质量和多样性的同时实现1.71倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高质量图像，但推理速度慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中应用不足，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和未能充分利用图像二维空间结构。

Method: 提出Hawk方法，利用图像的空间结构来引导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，相比标准自回归模型实现了1.71倍的加速，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk方法成功解决了自回归图像生成模型的推理速度问题，通过利用图像空间结构实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的可关节3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用于关节生成，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要密集视角监督的优化重建流程，要么生成粗糙几何近似且忽略表面纹理。将原生3D扩散模型扩展到关节对象训练面临重大挑战。

Method: 将预训练的静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将关节作为额外生成维度扩展SDS到3D-to-4D，给定不同关节状态的几张图像，联合优化几何、纹理和关节参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化对象类别上泛化良好，仅需几分钟完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D展示了无需任务特定训练或大规模关节数据集，即可实现高质量关节3D对象生成的可行性，为机器人、AR/VR和动画应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: VFXMaster是一个统一的、基于参考的视觉特效视频生成框架，通过上下文学习实现动态特效的迁移和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖'一个LoRA对应一个特效'的资源密集型范式，无法泛化到未见特效，限制可扩展性和创作能力的问题。

Method: 设计上下文条件策略和注意力掩码，精确解耦和注入特效属性；提出一次性特效适应机制提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效模仿各类特效信息，对域外特效表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: VFXMaster为视觉特效生成提供了统一的解决方案，具有出色的泛化能力，将开源代码、模型和数据集推动未来研究。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Conclusion: AmarDoctor在诊断准确性和专科推荐方面显著优于人类医生，证明其作为孟加拉语人群数字医疗解决方案的有效性，能够改善初级医疗服务获取。

Abstract: This study presents AmarDoctor, a multilingual voice-interactive digital
health app designed to provide comprehensive patient triage and AI-driven
clinical decision support for Bengali speakers, a population largely
underserved in access to digital healthcare. AmarDoctor adopts a data-driven
approach to strengthen primary care delivery and enable personalized health
management. While platforms such as AdaHealth, WebMD, Symptomate, and K-Health
have become popular in recent years, they mainly serve European demographics
and languages. AmarDoctor addresses this gap with a dual-interface system for
both patients and healthcare providers, supporting three major Bengali
dialects. At its core, the patient module uses an adaptive questioning
algorithm to assess symptoms and guide users toward the appropriate specialist.
To overcome digital literacy barriers, it integrates a voice-interactive AI
assistant that navigates users through the app services. Complementing this,
the clinician-facing interface incorporates AI-powered decision support that
enhances workflow efficiency by generating structured provisional diagnoses and
treatment recommendations. These outputs inform key services such as
e-prescriptions, video consultations, and medical record management. To
validate clinical accuracy, the system was evaluated against a gold-standard
set of 185 clinical vignettes developed by experienced physicians.
Effectiveness was further assessed by comparing AmarDoctor performance with
five independent physicians using the same vignette set. Results showed
AmarDoctor achieved a top-1 diagnostic precision of 81.08 percent (versus
physicians average of 50.27 percent) and a top specialty recommendation
precision of 91.35 percent (versus physicians average of 62.6 percent).

Conclusion: CCI框架既提供理论创新又提供可复现实现模式，挑战硅谷设计正统，为资源受限市场的公平AI部署提供可行框架。

Abstract: While global AI development prioritizes model performance and computational

different architectural decisions. This paper introduces Contextual and
Cultural Intelligence (CCI) -- a systematic framework enabling AI systems to
process cultural meaning, not just data patterns, through locally relevant,
emotionally intelligent, and economically inclusive design. Using design
science methodology, we validate CCI through a production AI-native
cross-border shopping platform serving diaspora communities. Key empirical
findings: 89% of users prefer WhatsApp-based AI interaction over traditional
web interfaces (n=602, chi-square=365.8, p<0.001), achieving 536 WhatsApp users
and 3,938 total conversations across 602 unique users in just 6 weeks, and
culturally informed prompt engineering demonstrates sophisticated understanding
of culturally contextualized queries, with 89% family-focused commerce patterns
and natural code-switching acceptance. The CCI framework operationalizes three
technical pillars: Infrastructure Intelligence (mobile-first, resilient
architectures), Cultural Intelligence (multilingual NLP with social context

Abstract: Accurate recognition of human emotions is critical for adaptive
human-computer interaction, yet remains challenging in dynamic,
conversation-like settings. This work presents a personality-aware multimodal
framework that integrates eye-tracking sequences, Big Five personality traits,
and contextual stimulus cues to predict both perceived and felt emotions.
Seventy-three participants viewed speech-containing clips from the CREMA-D
dataset while providing eye-tracking signals, personality assessments, and
emotion ratings. Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused
them with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM
and literature baselines. Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance
perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality
traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1
up to 0.58). These findings highlight the benefit of combining physiological,
trait-level, and contextual information to address the inherent subjectivity of
emotion. By distinguishing between perceived and felt responses, our approach
advances multimodal affective computing and points toward more personalized and
ecologically valid emotion-aware systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通常通过过程监督对LLM进行微调，这种弱探索激励无法有效增强智能推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习：首先在高质量轨迹上进行基础微调，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL来缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续超越先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上实现11.1%的相对改进，仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 仅使用结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中的智能推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RAVR框架，通过利用答案引导推理来增强大语言模型的推理能力，解决了在模型能力不足时难以采样高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，发现"为什么是这个答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为前者避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而进行解释性重构。当LLM在当前任务能力不足时，传统的强化学习难以采样高质量推理路径。

Method: 提出了RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分代理，通过答案引导来推导高质量推理路径。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型取得了持续改进，减少了推理中的犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能够显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，为增强LLM推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

TL;DR: 开发了PsyCoTalk，首个支持共病诊断的大规模对话数据集，包含3000个多轮诊断对话，通过合成EMR和多智能体框架构建，经精神科医生验证具有高真实性和诊断有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神科共病在临床上很常见但诊断复杂，现有数据集难以支持多障碍同时筛查，需要构建能够模拟真实临床访谈的共病诊断对话数据。

Method: 结合合成患者电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成，使用层次状态机和上下文树将临床访谈协议转化为支持130多个诊断状态的结构化框架。

Result: 创建了502个合成EMR和3000个多轮诊断对话，与真实临床记录相比在对话长度、标记分布和诊断推理策略方面具有高保真度，精神科医生确认其真实性和诊断有效性。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk数据集为精神科共病研究提供了宝贵资源，支持在一次对话中实现多障碍筛查的模型开发和评估，提升了诊断准确性和治疗规划能力。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: 提出GAP框架，通过图规划实现工具执行的并行化，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct采用顺序执行，无法利用独立子任务间的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下

Method: 训练智能体基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，智能决定并行和顺序执行策略，采用两阶段训练（SFT+RL）

Result: 在MHQA数据集上显著超越传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务中，通过智能并行化大幅提升工具调用效率

Conclusion: GAP框架通过依赖感知的图规划有效解决了顺序执行的瓶颈，实现了工具执行的智能并行化，提升了多步推理任务的性能

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

*Matthew Kelly*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了Epistemic Suite，一种后基础诊断方法学，用于揭示AI输出产生和接收的认知条件，通过20个诊断视角识别模式如信心洗白、叙事压缩等，并产生可检查的FACS包作为中间层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的流畅文本可能误导用户将模拟连贯性误认为真正理解，需要诊断方法来揭示其认知条件而非判断真伪。

Method: 采用20个诊断视角，基于三个设计原则：诊断生产先于评估主张、偏好诊断牵引力而非基础解决、将反思性嵌入结构要求。包含认知暂停、认知分诊协议和元治理层。

Result: 该方法将语言模型转向诊断立场，产生可检查的FACS包（标志、注释、矛盾地图、暂停日志），创建AI输出与人类判断之间的中间层。

Conclusion: Epistemic Suite作为外部脚手架运行，保持可消耗性和拒绝作为保障而非失败，维护性能与理解的区别，实现负责任审议同时保持认知谦逊。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent, plausible text that can mislead
users into mistaking simulated coherence for genuine understanding. This paper
introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for
surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and
received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through
twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to
reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced
authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:
diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction
over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural
requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts
language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable
artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS
bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.
A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit
breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based
on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage
Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link
activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and
pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into
model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite
operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as
safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between
performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while
maintaining epistemic modesty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索叙事分析在医疗差距研究中的价值，验证LLM能否从非裔美国人医疗经历故事中识别潜在因素和干预途径。

Method: 采用LDA主题建模识别50个非裔美国人故事中的主题，使用开源LLM进行层次化摘要，GPT4评估摘要质量并与专家评估对比。

Result: 识别出26个相关主题（健康行为、医疗团队互动、照护管理等），GPT4评估显示摘要无虚构、高度准确、全面有用，与专家评估一致性中等至高。

Conclusion: LDA和LLM结合能有效从非结构化叙事中提取医疗经验见解，为健康研究和临床改进提供新方法，最终改善医疗结果。

Abstract: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights
into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether
Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and
avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization
of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed
stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given
topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization
approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries
for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were
rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4
model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story
summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA
stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from
fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT
ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our
approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,
interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,
among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors
and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient
manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and
LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a
variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical
improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving
health outcomes.

TL;DR: PANORAMA是一个包含8,143条美国专利审查记录的完整数据集，包含原始申请、引用文献、非最终驳回和授权通知等完整决策轨迹，用于评估大语言模型在专利审查各步骤中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP研究将专利审查简化为预测任务，忽略了审查员基于详细信息的逐步评估过程，特别是办公室行动文件中的决策理由，这使得难以衡量当前技术在专利审查过程中的实际水平。

Method: 构建PANORAMA数据集，将专利审查轨迹分解为模拟专利专业人员审查过程的顺序基准，允许研究人员评估大语言模型在每个步骤中的能力。

Result: 研究发现，虽然大语言模型在检索相关现有技术和定位相关段落方面相对有效，但在评估专利权利要求的新颖性和非显而易见性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 在专利领域推进NLP（包括大语言模型）需要对真实世界的专利审查有更深入的理解，PANORAMA数据集为此提供了开放资源。

Abstract: Patent examination remains an ongoing challenge in the NLP literature even
after the advent of large language models (LLMs), as it requires an extensive
yet nuanced human judgment on whether a submitted claim meets the statutory
standards of novelty and non-obviousness against previously granted claims --
prior art -- in expert domains. Previous NLP studies have approached this
challenge as a prediction task (e.g., forecasting grant outcomes) with
high-level proxies such as similarity metrics or classifiers trained on
historical labels. However, this approach often overlooks the step-by-step
evaluations that examiners must make with profound information, including
rationales for the decisions provided in office actions documents, which also
makes it harder to measure the current state of techniques in patent review
processes. To fill this gap, we construct PANORAMA, a dataset of 8,143 U.S.
patent examination records that preserves the full decision trails, including
original applications, all cited references, Non-Final Rejections, and Notices
of Allowance. Also, PANORAMA decomposes the trails into sequential benchmarks
that emulate patent professionals' patent review processes and allow
researchers to examine large language models' capabilities at each step of
them. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs are relatively effective at
retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing the pertinent paragraphs, they
struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims. We discuss
these results and argue that advancing NLP, including LLMs, in the patent
domain requires a deeper understanding of real-world patent examination. Our
dataset is openly available at

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语音基础模型对声音质量（如吱吱声和呼吸声）的敏感性，通过开放式生成任务和语音情感识别来评估模型行为在不同发声输入下的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音理解基准主要依赖多项选择题回答格式，容易失败且无法可靠捕捉副语言特征对模型行为的细微影响。语音基础模型能够直接处理原始音频，但声音质量这一副语言变化维度尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过开放式生成任务和语音情感识别来探测语音基础模型，引入包含合成声音质量修改的新并行数据集，评估模型对吱吱声和呼吸声的响应。

Result: 提供了对语音基础模型对这些特定非词汇语音感知方面敏感性的首次检验。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统地检验了语音基础模型对声音质量变化的敏感性，为理解模型如何处理副语言信息提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct
processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual
representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially
respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal.
One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality,
encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation
types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and
social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely
rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to
failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic
features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through
open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether
model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce
a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality,
designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work
provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular
non-lexical aspects of speech perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个既能提供高精度无线感知，又能保证安全性和可审计性的系统，防止在分布偏移下的不安全行为，并支持隐私保护的联邦学习。

Method: 使用掩码频谱预训练和相位一致性正则化的编码器，结合跨模态对齐和校准选择性弃权头，实现四阶段证明管道（特征承诺、阈值绑定、时间窗口绑定、PLONK式证明）。

Result: 在活动检测、存在感知、呼吸监测和RF指纹识别等任务中，提高了宏F1分数和校准性能，在扰动下获得良好的覆盖-风险曲线，并能有效拒绝篡改和重放攻击。

Conclusion: ZK-SenseLM成功实现了安全可审计的无线感知，在保持高精度的同时提供了强大的安全保证和验证能力。

Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a
large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave
radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end
zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral
pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal
alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens.
To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated
selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is
registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving
pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version
binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the
quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and
confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a
gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates
with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization
without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are
part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion,
respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1
and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and
rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DMVFC的深度学习纤维聚类框架，利用多模态dMRI和fMRI数据实现功能一致的脑白质分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前纤维聚类方法主要使用纤维几何特征，忽略了功能性和微观结构信息。fMRI可以测量白质神经活动，为纤维聚类提供有价值的多模态信息。

Method: DMVFC包含两个主要组件：多视图预训练模块（分别计算几何、微观结构和功能信号的嵌入特征）和协作微调模块（同时优化嵌入差异）。

Result: 与两种最先进的纤维聚类方法相比，DMVFC在实现功能上有意义且一致的白质分割结果方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DMVFC能够有效整合白质纤维的几何、微观结构特征和fMRI BOLD信号，实现功能一致的白质分割。

Abstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method
for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural
connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies
primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial
trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the
functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is
increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using
functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information
for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore,
microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed
from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the
clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering
framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint
multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM
parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural
characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber
tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining
module to compute embedding features from each source of information
separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional
signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine
the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two
state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance
in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.

Motivation: 集中式医疗图像分类面临数据和隐私问题，联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在异构非IID数据和高通信成本方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用Top-k稀疏化技术，只传输前k个梯度来减少通信开销，解决数据异构性问题。

Result: 该方法提高了联邦学习效率，保持隐私保护，在非IID医疗图像设置中改善了诊断准确性和患者护理。

Conclusion: CFL-SparseMed为医疗图像分类提供了一个统一解决方案，有效平衡了通信效率、数据异构性和模型准确性。

Abstract: Secure and reliable medical image classification is crucial for effective
patient treatment, but centralized models face challenges due to data and
privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving

\textbf{CFL-SparseMed}, an FL approach that uses Top-k Sparsification to reduce

Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically
relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision
transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a
custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align
image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive
inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe
dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI
images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including
BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that
focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic
alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Resi-VidTok是一个用于超低速率轻量级视频传输的弹性令牌化框架，通过重要性排序的令牌流实现渐进编码和优雅质量降级，在恶劣信道条件下保持感知和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线网络中实时视频传输面临严峻挑战，特别是在有限带宽和弱连接等恶劣信道条件下，现有深度模型难以有效应对。

Method: 采用1D令牌化管道，整合差分时间令牌编码，支持从不完整令牌集可靠恢复；结合步长控制帧稀疏化和轻量级解码器侧插值器减少传输负载；使用信道自适应源-信道编码和调制方案动态分配速率和保护。

Result: 在低至0.0004的信道带宽比下仍能保持稳健的视觉和语义一致性，实时重建速度超过30fps。

Conclusion: Resi-VidTok为能效敏感、延迟敏感和可靠性关键的无线应用提供了实用的视频传输解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time transmission of video over wireless networks remains highly
challenging, even with advanced deep models, particularly under severe channel
conditions such as limited bandwidth and weak connectivity. In this paper, we
propose Resi-VidTok, a Resilient Tokenization-Enabled framework designed for
ultra-low-rate and lightweight video transmission that delivers strong
robustness while preserving perceptual and semantic fidelity on commodity
digital hardware. By reorganizing spatio--temporal content into a discrete,
importance-ordered token stream composed of key tokens and refinement tokens,
Resi-VidTok enables progressive encoding, prefix-decodable reconstruction, and
graceful quality degradation under constrained channels. A key contribution is
a resilient 1D tokenization pipeline for video that integrates differential
temporal token coding, explicitly supporting reliable recovery from incomplete
token sets using a single shared framewise decoder--without auxiliary temporal
extractors or heavy generative models. Furthermore, stride-controlled frame
sparsification combined with a lightweight decoder-side interpolator reduces
transmission load while maintaining motion continuity. Finally, a
channel-adaptive source--channel coding and modulation scheme dynamically
allocates rate and protection according to token importance and channel
condition, yielding stable quality across adverse SNRs. Evaluation results
indicate robust visual and semantic consistency at channel bandwidth ratios
(CBR) as low as 0.0004 and real-time reconstruction at over 30 fps,
demonstrating the practicality of Resi-VidTok for energy-efficient,
latency-sensitive, and reliability-critical wireless applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估端到端构建/测试成功率，无法揭示代理在环境配置中成功或失败的具体原因和过程，限制了软件工程代理的改进。

Method: 自动构建任务实例，注入真实README错误，在Docker中验证，提供过程级轨迹评估，包括规划、感知驱动错误诊断、反馈驱动修复和最终环境配置执行。

Result: 评估显示代理能够定位错误，但难以将反馈转化为有效修正，限制了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Enconda-bench通过过程级分析和端到端可执行性，为改进软件工程代理提供了可操作的见解，是首个环境配置过程级内部能力评估框架。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents show promise for software engineering, but
environment configuration remains a bottleneck due to heavy manual effort and
scarce large-scale, high-quality datasets. Existing benchmarks assess only
end-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.
We introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,
which provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent
capabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error
diagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment
configuration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting
realistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality
evaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end
executability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.
Evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while
agents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective
corrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench
is the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment
for environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving
software engineering agents.

TL;DR: StorageXTuner是一个基于LLM代理的存储系统自动调优框架，通过四个代理分离关注点，实现异构存储引擎的高效参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存储系统自动配置困难，参数空间大且工作负载、部署环境和版本差异大。现有启发式和ML调优器通常系统特定，需要手动粘合，且在变化时性能下降。LLM方法虽有帮助但通常将调优视为单次、系统特定的任务，限制了跨系统重用、约束了探索并削弱了验证。

Method: 提出StorageXTuner框架，包含四个代理：Executor（沙盒化基准测试）、Extractor（性能摘要）、Searcher（基于洞察的配置探索）和Reflector（洞察生成和管理）。设计采用洞察驱动的树搜索与分层内存，促进经验验证的洞察，并使用轻量级检查器防止不安全操作。

Result: 在RocksDB、LevelDB、CacheLib和MySQL InnoDB上使用YCSB、MixGraph和TPC-H/C进行评估。相比默认设置和ELMo-Tune，StorageXTuner吞吐量最高提升575%和111%，p99延迟最多降低88%和56%，且收敛所需试验次数更少。

Conclusion: StorageXTuner通过LLM代理驱动的框架有效解决了存储系统自动调优的挑战，实现了跨系统的性能提升和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large
and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and
ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under
changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a
single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains
exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM
agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines.
StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed
benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided
configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management).
The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that
promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to
guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on
RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C.
Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up
to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and
56%, and converges with fewer trials.

### [161] [CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24805)

TL;DR: 使用条件去噪扩散概率模型从非衰减校正PET图像生成合成CT图像，用于PET成像中的衰减校正，避免额外CT扫描的辐射暴露和配准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像中的衰减问题会导致定量不准确，传统CT校正方法存在额外辐射暴露、空间配准误差和设备成本高的问题，需要开发替代方案。

Method: 采用条件去噪扩散概率模型，结合三个正交视图的非衰减校正PET图像，通过集成投票生成伪CT图像。

Result: 在159个头颈部扫描研究中，伪CT生成质量显著提升，CT图像平均绝对误差为32±10.4 HU，PET重建图像在所有感兴趣区域的平均误差为(1.48±0.68)%。

Conclusion: DDPM方法能够从非衰减校正PET图像生成高质量的伪CT图像，有效解决PET成像中的衰减校正问题，减少辐射暴露和配准误差。

Abstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential
for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue
encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution
of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching
detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal
degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to
differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to
misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed
Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon
attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to
extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial
misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment
infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an
alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation
reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can
generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in
order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from
non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble
voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and
improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans
acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method
achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an
average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when
comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated
pseudo-CT versus the true CT.

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo协议利用群体智能和分布式成对排名共识，在AI推理中实现优于多数投票的性能，在GPQA Diamond上达到85.90%准确率，比多数投票提升17.21个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和训练规模收益递减，需要能够水平扩展容量和能力的推理层。

Method: 采用群体推理方法，通过成对排名和Bradley-Terry风格聚合模型实现异构模型间的声誉加权共识，结合链上声誉系统和能力证明来抵抗Sybil攻击。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优异，GPQA Diamond准确率85.90%，比多数投票高17.21个百分点；对抗性提示注入性能下降仅0.12%，而单体模型基线下降6.20%。

Conclusion: 为去中心化AI系统奠定基础，通过集体智能实现高质量推理的民主化访问，同时保持可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型中的文化敏感神经元，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感。通过CVQA基准测试，作者识别并验证了这些神经元的存在，并提出了新的识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型表现优异，但在处理文化相关输入时仍存在困难。作者旨在理解模型如何处理文化背景信息，特别是识别对特定文化敏感的神经元。

Method: 使用CVQA基准测试，在25个文化群体上测试三种VLMs。识别文化选择性神经元并进行因果测试（通过停用神经元）。提出了新的基于边际的选择器CAS，并与现有的概率和熵基方法进行比较。

Result: 实验证明存在这样的神经元：停用它们会显著影响对应文化问题的性能，而对其他文化影响很小。CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有方法。层分析显示这些神经元倾向于聚集在某些解码器层。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态表征的内部组织方式，发现了专门处理文化信息的神经元集群，为理解VLMs如何处理文化背景信息提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型的固有低维结构是一个重要问题，本文旨在从模型无关的角度研究语言模型作为序列概率模型的低维结构。

Method: 首先实证证明现代语言模型的logits矩阵具有低秩结构，然后利用这种结构通过不相关提示输出的线性组合来生成目标提示的响应。

Result: 实验表明多种现代语言模型都展现出低秩特性，并且可以利用这种特性有效地生成响应。理论分析也支持这一发现。

Conclusion: 语言模型具有普遍的低维结构，这种结构可以用于改进生成过程，为理解和优化语言模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合量子-经典循环神经网络架构，其中整个循环核心由参数化量子电路实现，由经典前馈网络控制。该模型在多个序列学习任务中表现出与强经典基准相竞争的性能。

Result: 在情感分析、MNIST、置换MNIST、复制记忆和语言建模等任务中，使用最多14个量子比特进行模拟，模型表现与强经典基准相竞争。在序列到序列模型中开发的软注意力机制在机器翻译任务中显示有效性。

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于量子操作并在广泛序列学习任务中实现与强经典基准竞争性能的模型，为量子机器学习提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Result: 相比先前工作，提出的概念在数量上更一致，用户认为更可解释，同时保持竞争力的ImageNet性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更忠实的概念解释，概念更具一致性和可解释性，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SVD分解的结构化局部学习框架，通过在低秩流形上训练神经网络，减少可训练参数数量，同时保持与反向传播相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播全局误差传播和全参数化带来的内存和计算开销问题，以及直接反馈对齐方法在深层架构中可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 在SVD分解的低秩流形上训练网络，对SVD分量应用复合损失函数（交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化），构建匹配SVD结构的反馈矩阵。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上达到与反向传播相当的准确率，减少了可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习是替代全秩梯度训练的有原则且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景覆盖评估方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或计算密集型大视觉语言模型，在大规模部署中成本高、效率低，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 通过蒸馏过程训练SCOUT模型，学习近似LVLM生成的覆盖标签，利用预计算的感知特征，避免冗余计算，实现快速可扩展的场景覆盖估计。

Result: 在真实自主导航场景的大规模数据集上评估，SCOUT在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本，为大规模覆盖分析提供了有效实用的替代方案。

Conclusion: SCOUT代表了自主系统中高效场景覆盖监督的重要进展，虽然其性能依赖于LVLM生成的训练标签质量，但为大规模部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

TL;DR: SynHLMA是一个用于生成手部语言操纵序列的框架，能够根据语言指令合成手部与铰接物体的交互动作，包括生成、预测和插值三种典型任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手部抓取生成方法主要关注物体功能，但在铰接物体交互中需要同时考虑物体变形和长期操纵序列，这需要更综合的建模方法。

Method: 使用离散HAOI表示建模每个手-物体交互帧，结合自然语言嵌入，通过HAOI操纵语言模型在共享表示空间中对齐抓取过程和语言描述，并采用关节感知损失确保手部抓取跟随铰接物体关节的动态变化。

Conclusion: SynHLMA框架能够有效生成符合语言指令的手部与铰接物体交互序列，为具身AI和VR/AR应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.
