### [1] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据标签的方法，结合音频基础模型和语言模型，无需微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对话转录的可读性和信息量，通过添加说话者特征（如年龄、性别、情感）的元数据标签，丰富转录内容。

Method: 使用冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和语言模型（LLAMA），通过轻量级连接器桥接音频与语言表示，推断说话者属性。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；冻结的LLAMA模型在某些场景下通过直接比较x-vectors实现了8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话转录后处理提供了一种高效且无需微调的解决方案，能够丰富转录内容并提升实用性。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

### [2] [Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04796)
*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决低资源语言在分词中的不平等问题，通过优化压缩增益实现跨语言公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的分词算法依赖频率目标，导致低资源语言的分词结果较差，加剧了语言间的计算和金融不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩最差语言的压缩增益。

Result: 实验表明，该算法能显著改善语言间的分词公平性，且对全局压缩率和下游任务性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的解决方案，可在不牺牲性能的前提下提升分词的跨语言公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

### [3] [Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04814)
*David Sasu,Natalie Schluter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过结合半监督语音表示和音高重音检测模块，联合训练模型显著提升了ASR性能和音高重音检测的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过保留或重新学习重要的韵律线索（如音高重音）来提升预训练语音模型的性能。

Method: 提出了一种联合ASR和音高重音检测的模型，利用半监督语音表示进行训练。

Result: 音高重音检测的F1分数提升了41%，ASR在LibriSpeech上的WER降低了28.3%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩展预训练语音模型以保留韵律线索对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to
retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.

### [4] [Persistent Instability in LLM's Personality Measurements: Effects of Scale, Reasoning, and Conversation History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04826)
*Tommaso Tosato,Saskia Helbling,Yorguin-Jose Mantilla-Ramos,Mahmood Hegazy,Alberto Tosato,David John Lemay,Irina Rish,Guillaume Dumas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERSIST框架评估了25+开源大语言模型的人格稳定性，发现即使是400B+参数的模型也存在显著的行为不一致性，提示当前LLM缺乏真正的行为一致性基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的人格稳定性，以评估其在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Method: 使用传统和LLM适应的人格测试工具（如BFI-44、SD3），系统性地改变问题顺序、重述、角色和推理模式，评估500,000+模型响应。

Result: 发现模型行为存在显著不稳定性，包括响应变异性高、提示顺序影响人格测量、干预措施可能增加变异性等。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性的基础，人格对齐策略可能不足以满足安全关键应用的需求。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

### [5] [RCR-Router: Efficient Role-Aware Context Routing for Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Structured Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04903)
*Jun Liu,Zhenglun Kong,Changdi Yang,Fan Yang,Tianqi Li,Peiyan Dong,Joannah Nanjekye,Hao Tang,Geng Yuan,Wei Niu,Wenbin Zhang,Pu Zhao,Xue Lin,Dong Huang,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RCR-Router的动态上下文路由框架，用于多智能体大语言模型（LLM）系统，旨在解决现有静态或全上下文路由策略的不足，如高令牌消耗和适应性差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体LLM系统的协调机制通常依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过高、内存冗余以及跨轮次适应性不足。

Method: RCR-Router是一个模块化、角色感知的上下文路由框架，动态选择语义相关的内存子集，并采用轻量级评分策略指导内存选择，同时迭代整合智能体输出到共享内存中。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，RCR-Router减少了令牌使用（最高30%），同时保持或提升了答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对提升多智能体LLM系统的可扩展性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

### [6] [I Think, Therefore I Am Under-Qualified? A Benchmark for Evaluating Linguistic Shibboleth Detection in LLM Hiring Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04939)
*Julia Kharchenko,Tanya Roosta,Aman Chadha,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）对语言标志（shibboleths）反应的基准，揭示了LLMs对某些语言模式（如模糊语言）的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在语言标志上的反应，以揭示其潜在的基于语言模式的偏见，尤其是在性别、社会阶层或地区背景等人口统计学属性上的歧视。

Method: 通过100个验证过的问题-回答对构建访谈模拟，生成受控的语言变体以隔离特定现象，同时保持语义等价。

Result: 模糊语言的回答平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准在识别模型特定偏见上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测和衡量AI系统中的语言歧视提供了基础框架，对自动化决策中的公平性有广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

### [7] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统，解决了动词语义和图像解释的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准精确匹配评估无法捕捉动词语义和图像解释的模糊性，导致模型性能评估不完整。

Method: 提出视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义簇，用于评估活动识别模型。

Result: 在imSitu数据集中，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义簇，簇基评估更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: 簇基评估提供了更细致的模型性能评估，优于标准评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

### [8] [A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05003)
*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段大语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），提高了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自杀事件中SDoH因素提取的挑战，如长尾分布、关键压力因素分析和模型可解释性不足。

Method: 采用多阶段大语言模型框架，对比了BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1，并通过用户研究评估模型解释效果。

Result: 框架在SDoH因素提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现更优，且小模型微调可降低成本。多阶段设计提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和预防策略制定。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [9] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构熵最小化的方法，将多轮对话划分为语义独立的子对话，以减少噪声并提升情感四元组提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设对话中情感元素均匀分布，但实际上对话常包含多个语义独立的子对话，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 利用结构熵最小化算法划分对话，并采用两步框架：先在话语级别提取情感元素，再在子对话级别匹配四元组。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最优性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过语义划分和两步提取，有效解决了对话中情感四元组提取的噪声问题，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

### [10] [Evaluation of LLMs in AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05028)
*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了四种LLM架构在AMR解析中的表现，发现简单微调即可达到SOTA性能，其中LLaMA 3.2表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索微调解码器LLM在AMR解析中的潜力，简化现有复杂方法。

Method: 微调四种LLM（Phi 3.5、Gemma 2、LLaMA 3.2、DeepSeek R1）并使用LDC2020T02测试集评估。

Result: LLaMA 3.2性能接近SOTA解析器（SMATCH F1: 0.804），Phi 3.5在结构有效性上表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单微调解码器LLM可替代复杂AMR解析器，LLaMA 3.2和Phi 3.5各具优势。

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [11] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简化且高效的参数高效微调方法Align-LoRA，挑战了多任务学习中多适配器或多头的复杂结构范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中，现有方法倾向于使用复杂的多适配器或多头结构以捕获任务特定知识，但作者发现这种结构可能并非最优。

Method: 作者提出了一种简化的多头架构（高头间相似性）和单适配器LoRA（增加秩），并进一步设计了Align-LoRA，通过显式损失对齐任务表示。

Result: 实验表明，Align-LoRA显著优于所有基线方法，验证了共享表示的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文表明，多任务学习的泛化能力依赖于学习鲁棒的共享表示，而非隔离任务特定特征，Align-LoRA为此提供了更简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/jinda-liu/Align-LoRA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“MultiCheck”的多模态事实核查框架，通过结合文本和图像信号进行细粒度验证，显著提升了事实核查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态错误信息的增加对依赖文本证据的事实核查系统提出了挑战，需要一种能够同时处理文本和图像的方法。

Method: MultiCheck框架结合了文本和图像的专用编码器，通过融合模块捕捉跨模态关系，并使用对比学习目标优化语义对齐。

Result: 在Factify 2数据集上，MultiCheck的加权F1得分为0.84，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了显式多模态推理的有效性，为复杂现实场景中的可扩展和可解释事实核查提供了潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [13] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出BEE-RAG框架，通过熵不变性原理解决检索增强生成（RAG）中长上下文导致的熵增长和注意力稀释问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识局限性促使RAG成为补充手段，但长检索上下文导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用平衡上下文熵重构注意力动态，分离注意力敏感性与上下文长度，并通过零样本推理和多重要性估计优化平衡因子。

Result: 实验证明BEE-RAG在多种RAG任务中有效。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程优化RAG性能，适应不同上下文长度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AttnRank的注意力驱动重排序框架，通过调整输入信息的位置以优化大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型对输入信息位置的敏感性，发现模型倾向于关注序列开头和结尾的内容，而忽略中间部分。

Method: 提出AttnRank框架，分两步：校准模型的位置注意力偏好，并重排序输入以匹配高注意力位置。

Result: 实验表明AttnRank在多种任务和模型上显著提升性能，无需修改模型参数或训练过程。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效、即插即用的方法，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

TL;DR: PrinciplismQA是一个用于评估大语言模型在医疗伦理方面表现的基准测试，包含3648个问题，揭示模型在伦理知识与应用间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试常忽视大语言模型的伦理推理能力，医疗领域需要更严格的伦理评估。

Method: 基于Principlism理论，构建包含选择题和开放式问题的数据集，问题来自权威教材和案例研究，并由医学专家验证。

Result: 实验显示模型在动态应用伦理原则（如Beneficence）时表现不佳，前沿闭源模型表现最佳，医学领域微调可提升伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断模型伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，推动更平衡、负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: This paper presents the contributions of the ATLANTIS team to SemEval-2025
Task 3, focusing on detecting hallucinated text spans in question answering
systems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural
Language Generation (NLG) but remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating
incorrect or misleading content. To address this, we explored methods both with
and without external context, utilizing few-shot prompting with a LLM,
token-level classification or LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data. Notably, our
approaches achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in
English and German. This work highlights the importance of integrating relevant
context to mitigate hallucinations and demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
models and prompt engineering.

Method: 采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式，首先生成初始推理数据集，训练中等规模的助理模型，再联合训练轻量级学生模型进行推理和分类。

Result: 实验表明，MulCoT-RD仅需3B参数即可在JMSRC任务上表现优异，并具备良好的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境提供了高效的多模态情感推理和分类解决方案，同时兼顾性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖人工标注指令，成本高且难以扩展，而代码片段资源丰富。

Method: CodeBoost包含最大团选择、双向预测、错误感知预测、异构增强和异构奖励五个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多代码LLM和基准测试中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种高效且可扩展的代码LLM训练方法。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为早期错误对推理链影响最大，但本文通过实验发现晚期错误更具破坏性，需针对性解决。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包含自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE），通过位置影响评分函数和双路径校正机制处理晚期脆弱性。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH基准测试中，ASCoT表现优异，显著优于标准CoT方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明需针对特定失败模式设计自适应校正机制，而非统一验证策略。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Result: 在不同参数规模下（39M至1.3B），SONAR-LLM表现出竞争力，并发布了完整训练代码和预训练模型。

Conclusion: SONAR-LLM成功结合了LCM的优势并简化了训练过程，为未来研究提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LRLMs中因复杂反思行为导致的过度思考问题，减少冗余推理步骤、降低推理成本并提升实用性。

Method: 提出Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS)，动态抑制高置信度时的反思触发词生成，无需重新训练或修改模型架构。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用量，同时保持准确性，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CGRS是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于不同规模和架构的LRLMs，具有显著的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Result: 用户偏好可调整设置，但未显著改善体验；系统在功能和交互设计上存在问题。

Conclusion: 个性化不足，需默认提供可理解的手语虚拟角色，建议改进动画和交互设计。

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM自我纠正提供了见解，并建议未来比较LLM反馈与人类专家输入的效果。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Conclusion: MyCulture证明了开放式结构在提高公平性和区分力上的有效性，呼吁开发更多文化和语言包容的LLMs评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen

contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks

spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了多种创造力衡量指标（创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge），发现其一致性有限，并提出需改进评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估不同创造力指标在多个创意领域的表现，揭示其局限性。

Method: 通过分析创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge在创意写作、非常规问题解决和研究构思中的应用。

Result: 发现这些指标一致性有限，各有局限性，如创造力指数侧重词汇多样性，困惑度依赖模型信心等。

Conclusion: 强调需要更稳健、通用的评估框架以更贴合人类对创造力的判断。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG)方法，通过系统化问题分解和依赖感知推理增强大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中容易产生幻觉，现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不足。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LAG显著提升了推理鲁棒性，减少幻觉，并更贴近人类认知。

Conclusion: LAG为现有RAG系统提供了一种基于逻辑的替代方案，提升了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过20 Questions游戏评估LLMs的地理偏见，发现模型在推断全球北方和西方实体时表现更优，且语言对性能差距影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已调整以减少显性偏见，但其预训练数据中的隐性偏见仍存在，需通过创新方法揭示。

Method: 使用Geo20Q+数据集，在七种语言和两种游戏配置下测试LLMs的地理表现。

Result: LLMs在推断全球北方和西方实体时表现更优，且语言对性能差距影响较小。

Conclusion: 自由形式的评估框架能揭示LLMs的隐性偏见，地理和文化差异嵌入其推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种解码策略，通过动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和基于上下文的复制分布，提高法律文本生成的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域的应用因生成不可靠或虚构内容而受限，现有方法如检索增强生成和上下文感知解码未能有效保证上下文的忠实整合。

Method: 提出CoCoLex解码策略，根据模型置信度动态调整词汇分布，鼓励从上下文中直接复制内容。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有上下文感知解码方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强上下文的忠实整合，显著提升了法律文本生成的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

*Guang Yang,Xinyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于频率的不确定性量化方法，利用共形预测确保覆盖保证，提升LLM在MCQA中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多选题回答中的不可靠性（如幻觉和过度自信），以适用于高风险领域。

Method: 通过多次独立采样模型输出分布，以最频繁样本为参考计算预测熵（PE）。

Result: 频率PE优于基于logit的PE，能有效区分正确与错误预测，并控制误覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑盒场景下的不确定性量化提供了模型无关的框架，增强了LLM的实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，西方多语言大模型（MLLMs）中政治观点在语言间转移，而非独立存在，且政治对齐后观点变化一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言大模型是否反映跨语言政治观点差异，以及政治对齐对观点的影响。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估五种西方语言中模型的意见，并在政治对齐前后进行对比。

Result: 未对齐模型显示极少跨语言差异；政治对齐后观点在五种语言中几乎一致变化。

Conclusion: 西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间转移，突显MLLMs在文化、政治对齐上的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathSmith是一个新框架，通过从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成高难度数学问题，提升LLM推理能力，实验证明其在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成方法依赖人工模板，缺乏多样性和可扩展性，限制了LLM在数学推理上的进步。

Method: MathSmith从零构建问题，使用九种预定义策略增加难度，并通过强化学习优化结构有效性、推理复杂性和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试（包括简单、中等和困难类别）中，MathSmith均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升LLM推理能力方面的潜力，具有强扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出Cooper框架，联合优化策略模型和奖励模型，解决规则奖励不鲁棒和模型奖励易受攻击的问题，通过动态训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型存在规则奖励不鲁棒和模型奖励易受攻击的局限性，需一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，结合规则奖励的高精度和动态训练奖励模型，引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模。

Result: 实验显示Cooper缓解了奖励攻击，提升RL性能，如在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上平均准确率提高0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是有效对抗奖励攻击的方法，为奖励模型与RL的更好结合提供参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

TL;DR: OmniEAR是一个评估语言模型在具身任务中物理交互、工具使用和多智能体协调能力的框架，揭示了现有模型在动态能力和自主协调方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身推理中的能力，填补现有基准测试在动态工具获取和自主协调策略方面的不足。

Method: 通过文本环境表示建模连续物理属性和复杂空间关系，覆盖1,500个家庭和工业场景，系统评估模型在工具推理和隐式协作中的表现。

Result: 模型在显式指令下表现良好（85-96%成功率），但在动态工具推理（56-85%）和隐式协作（63-85%）中性能下降，复合任务失败率超50%。完整环境信息反而降低协调性能。

Conclusion: 具身推理对现有模型提出根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理大语言模型（R-LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在长形式事实性任务中容易产生幻觉，且缺乏可靠的验证方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的奖励函数，综合考虑事实精度、回答详细程度和相关性，并应用于在线强化学习。

Result: 在六个长形式事实性基准测试中，模型平均减少了23.1个百分点的幻觉率，回答详细程度提高了23%，且整体回答帮助性未下降。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数有效提升了R-LLMs在长形式事实性任务中的表现，解决了奖励黑客问题。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

Motivation: 研究动机源于对LLMs如何说服人类的理解不足，以及线性探针在分析模型表示方面的潜力。

Method: 方法包括利用认知科学见解训练探针，分析说服动态的不同方面，并与基于提示的方法进行比较。

Result: 结果显示探针在多轮对话中能有效捕捉说服动态，且在速度和性能上优于基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 结论认为探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的可行工具，尤其适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

TL;DR: H-NET++是一种分层动态分块模型，通过端到端训练学习语言学信息的分割，解决了字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级语言模型避免了脆弱的标记器，但在形态丰富的语言中面临计算挑战，因为单词可能跨越多个字节。

Method: H-NET++采用轻量级Transformer上下文混合器、两级潜在超先验、专门处理正字法伪影（如波斯语ZWNJ）以及基于课程的训练。

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最佳结果：比BPE-based GPT-2-fa压缩率提高12%，ParsGLUE性能提升5.4pp，对ZWNJ损坏的鲁棒性提高53%，形态边界F1得分为73.8%。

Conclusion: H-NET++的分层动态分块为形态丰富语言提供了一种无需标记器的有效解决方案，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: RetinexDual提出了一种基于Retinex理论的新框架，通过两个互补子网络（SAMBA和FIA）解决UHD图像恢复中的问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频域转换）在UHD图像恢复中存在信息丢失或局部退化问题，RetinexDual旨在克服这些限制。

Method: RetinexDual包含两个子网络：SAMBA（用于反射分量校正）和FIA（用于频域中的颜色和光照校正）。

Result: 在四种UHD图像恢复任务中，RetinexDual在质量和定量指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过互补设计有效解决了UHD图像恢复问题，其各组件的重要性通过消融实验得到验证。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

Motivation: 现有公共基准在ENT内窥镜分析中缺乏对分类和相似病例检索的支持，且设备、操作者差异及细微病变增加了分析难度。

Method: 提供专家标注的图像数据集，包含解剖区域、正常/异常状态标签及双语描述，并定义三个基准任务，采用服务器端评分。

Result: 报告了表现最佳团队的结果，并提供了深入讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep填补了ENT内窥镜分析领域的空白，为临床提供了可靠的分类和检索工具。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

Result: ViT-Tiny在ImageNet-1K上达到75.4% Top-1，密集预测任务中表现优异，刷新紧凑自监督蒸馏的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMAD通过多教师蒸馏和共识机制，显著提升了紧凑模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于重建的扩散模型在异常检测中存在计算成本高、重建结果不准确及噪声水平选择困难等问题。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了重建过程，提高了效率和准确性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有方法，F1分数分别提升7%和13%。

Conclusion: RADAR通过无重建方法解决了传统扩散模型的局限性，为实时异常检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了低成本眼球追踪算法，未来将通过LRP进一步提升模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

TL;DR: LuKAN模型基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）和Lucas多项式激活，通过离散小波变换和空间投影层实现高效且准确的3D人体运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测精度和计算效率之间难以平衡，LuKAN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 模型使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，核心为基于Lucas多项式的KAN层，最后通过逆小波变换生成预测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优于基线模型，兼具计算效率。

Conclusion: LuKAN在3D人体运动预测中实现了精度与效率的平衡。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度视觉线索识别和复杂推理能力的新框架，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估MLLMs对细微视觉线索的识别和复杂推理能力，而这些能力对深度视觉理解至关重要。

Method: 提出VER-Bench框架，包含374个精心设计的问题，覆盖地理空间、时间、情境、意图、系统状态和符号推理，每个问题附带结构化证据。

Result: 当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的推理方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Motivation: Transformer-based目标检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和固定查询导致的低效问题上表现不佳。

Method: DAMM引入三种查询：基于视觉语言模型的外观查询、多边形嵌入的位置查询和随机学习查询，并通过双流交叉注意力模块分别优化语义和空间特征。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力机制显著提升了目标检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高多模态仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

Motivation: 现有视频高光检测方法因使用固定模型而无法适应不同测试视频的独特特性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合主任务（高光检测）和辅助任务（跨模态幻觉），通过元辅助训练方案实现测试时自适应。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了现有高光检测模型的性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应有效解决了现有方法的泛化问题，提升了高光检测性能。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，无需重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在鱼眼图像上因相机参数变化导致深度估计错误，需一种无需额外数据的方法实现适配。

Method: 引入校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，利用自监督学习从透视图像生成鱼眼图像并强制估计一致性。

Result: 在室内外场景中，方法优于现有技术，仅需一组令牌即可适配多种FMDEs。

Conclusion: 通过调整潜在嵌入分布，成功将FMDEs扩展到鱼眼图像，避免了传统方法的负面影响。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

Conclusion: 模型性能优异，但未达100%准确率的原因可能是数据集中的双标签问题（重复图像不同标签）。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on

rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM在零样本和小样本分类任务中显著提升泛化性能，且计算成本几乎不增加。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言应用提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，TRKT实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT通过知识转移和动态场景适应，显著提升了弱监督动态场景图生成的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学影像，还可推广到其他领域，如放射学、遥感和自动驾驶。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: HOW-Seg通过人机交互动态优化预测，实现了高质量的分割效果，为开放世界点云语义分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Result: 在稀疏视角3D合成中表现优于现有方法，如PSNR提升3.27%。

Conclusion: 自适应加权和不确定性学习显著提升了3DGS在稀疏视角下的渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Waymo Open Dataset上实现了更高的mAP和召回率。

Conclusion: 通过增加自由度，优化了质量与成本的权衡，提升了性能。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散图像压缩方法存在解码延迟高和保真度不足的问题，SODEC旨在通过单步解码和保真度改进来解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜在表示，用单步解码替代多步去噪，并引入保真度引导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Result: SODEC在率失真感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升20倍以上。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，实现了高效且高质量的图像压缩。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用深度基础模型增强深度补全鲁棒性的新框架，无需大规模训练即可在OOD场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全模型依赖有限数据，在OOD场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在单目深度估计中表现出色，因此探索如何利用基础模型提升深度补全的鲁棒性。

Method: 结合深度基础模型提取RGB图像的环境线索（结构和语义上下文），设计无参数的双空间传播方法（3D和2D空间），并引入可学习的校正模块逐步优化深度预测。

Result: 在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上训练，并在16个其他数据集上评估，OOD场景中表现优异，超越现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合基础模型和双空间传播，显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但模态差距限制了其直接用于无监督域适应的效果。

Method: 设计了一个模态分离框架，分离模态特定和模态不变组件，并利用模态自适应集成权重优化性能。

Result: 在多种实验设置下，性能提升高达9%，计算效率提高9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态差距问题，显著提升了无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索快速学习如何通过快速权重（如LoRA）在深度神经网络早期层中引入全局上下文敏感性。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer自编码器，结合LoRA实现快速权重，研究熟悉性训练对自注意力机制的影响。

Result: 熟悉性训练使早期层与顶层全局上下文对齐，扩展自注意力范围，且LoRA显著增强效果。

Conclusion: 熟悉性训练在分层网络中引入全局敏感性，混合快速-慢速权重架构为研究大脑快速学习提供计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言模型在遮挡场景中忽视细粒度属性信息的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先生成属性伪标签，再结合整体与细粒度信息进行特征提取。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能，显著提升遮挡和细微差异的处理能力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID有效结合整体与细粒度信息，为遮挡Re-ID提供新思路。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAM的视频持续学习方法，通过压缩视频数据减少存储需求，并解决了视频压缩器的遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习面临高内存需求和长视频流的挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 使用压缩视觉技术存储视频编码而非原始数据，并通过刷新视频编码解决遗忘问题。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模数据集上，CRAM方法显著优于现有技术，且内存占用更低。

Conclusion: CRAM方法有效解决了视频持续学习中的内存和遗忘问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高变异性与复杂性导致现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现不佳，尤其是面对领域偏移时。

Method: MCDRL分两步：1）利用CLIP的跨模态能力识别病变区域并构建领域特异性变异的混淆字典；2）训练因果干预网络消除这些变异的影响，保留关键解剖结构信息。

Result: 实验表明MCDRL在分割准确性和泛化能力上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCDRL通过因果驱动的方法有效提升了医学图像分割的领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Result: 评估了传统IQA方法和大型多模态模型在AI-UGC上的表现。

Conclusion: 论文为AI-UGC的感知质量评估提供了基准数据集和分析，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，早期诊断和准确治疗至关重要。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且易导致医生疲劳，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两种新指标评估临床相关性。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架能够高效生成临床相关的SOAP笔记，减轻医生负担，适用于实际医疗场景。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的快速发展需要超越人类感知的图像质量评估方法，尤其是确保场景构图结构的完整性。

Method: SCSSIM是一种无需训练的度量方法，通过图像的分层统计测量来量化SCS的保持情况。

Result: 实验表明，SCSSIM对非构图失真具有高不变性，而对构图失真表现出单调递减，准确反映SCS变化。

Conclusion: SCSSIM在结构评估方面优于现有方法，是开发和评估生成模型的重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Motivation: 现有视频ReID方法未能有效识别和选择查询-库对中最具区分性的特征，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: HAMoBE框架利用预训练大模型（如CLIP）的多层特征，分两级提取特征：第一级从冻结大模型中提取低层特征，第二级由专注于长期、短期和时间特征的专家组成，并通过双输入决策门控网络动态调整专家贡献。

Conclusion: HAMoBE通过分层和自适应特征整合，有效解决了视频ReID中的特征选择问题，为动态环境下的监控和安全提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现，揭示了当前模型的潜力与局限。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS提出了一种两阶段框架，通过解耦类感知检测和类无关分割，解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSS方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和次优的保留-可塑性平衡。

Method: DecoupleCSS分为两阶段：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成位置感知提示；第二阶段利用SAM模型生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能，平衡了保留和适应性。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦设计有效解决了CSS中的灾难性遗忘问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过分类和对抗学习实现自动图像着色的方法，改进了传统回归任务的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像着色任务具有高度不适定性，传统回归方法忽略了颜色预测的多模态特性，因此需要更先进的方法。

Method: 采用分类和对抗学习技术，基于前人工作构建模型并进行改进和比较。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但强调了方法的改进和比较。

Conclusion: 分类和对抗学习为图像着色提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup是一种无需辅助面部控制组件的高保真、身份一致且鲁棒的化妆迁移框架，通过直接利用源-参考图像对实现卓越的迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN或扩散模型的方法依赖额外组件来平衡迁移质量和身份一致性，但会引入额外误差，导致效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，使用源图像作为条件输入，并引入轻量级化妆特征注入器RefLoRAInjector，同时设计了鲁棒的数据生成流程。

Result: 实验表明，FLUX-Makeup在多样场景中表现鲁棒，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup通过简化框架和优化数据生成，显著提升了化妆迁移的效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs的预训练背景多样且不透明，导致潜在偏差，影响下游应用的通用性和透明度。

Method: 通过压缩和对齐来自不同模型的瓦片级特征，并采用轻量级注意力机制根据组织表型上下文自适应融合。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务上均优于单个PFM，并提供模型生物语义特化的可解释性。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，提升性能并增强模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和视频长度限制的问题，PoseGen旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用in-context LoRA微调策略，在token级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿态信息以控制运动。通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制实现长视频生成。

Result: PoseGen在身份保真度、姿态准确性和生成无限长度视频方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen通过创新的微调和分段生成策略，成功解决了长视频生成中的身份漂移和长度限制问题。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）是一种新型的Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning（FSCIL）方法，通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边界惩罚，解决了基类判别性和新类泛化性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本高的问题导致增量任务中训练数据不足，现有方法难以平衡基类判别性和新类泛化性。

Method: SMP结合了Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging（MIAM）机制和Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration（MPCC）策略，分别用于基任务学习和增量任务中的决策边界优化。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中达到了最先进的性能，并更好地平衡了基类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP通过创新的边界惩罚策略，显著提升了FSCIL的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在病理图像分类中因处理大量高分辨率图像块导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，包括动态多实例网络（DMIN）和双分支轻量级实例预筛选网络（DB-LIPN），通过自蒸馏和不对称蒸馏两步训练筛选无关图像块。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，AHDMIL在分类性能和推理速度上均优于现有方法，例如在Camelyon16数据集上准确率提升5.3%，推理速度加快1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL通过高效筛选相关图像块和引入CKA分类器，显著提升了病理图像分类的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的视觉定位框架，通过生成多个潜在表达来补充单一文本输入的不足，提升目标对象的定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一文本输入，无法充分利用视觉细节，导致相似对象误识别。

Method: 引入主题分发器和视觉概念注入器模块，结合共享主题和独特属性概念，并采用正边距对比学习策略对齐潜在表达。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有RIS和REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和对比学习策略，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Result: 在有限数据场景下，FedGIN比无GIN的联邦学习提升12-18%的3D Dice分数；在完整数据场景下，性能接近集中式训练，显著优于单模态基线。

Conclusion: FedGIN在多模态医学图像分割中表现出色，具有强大的跨模态泛化能力，同时保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Motivation: 在任意尺度图像超分辨率任务中，低分辨率图像的几何模式（如重复纹理、边缘或形状）容易扭曲变形，导致高分辨率恢复时出现伪影。旋转等变性能够保持原始图像的方向和结构完整性，因此本文致力于构建一种旋转等变的ASISR方法。

Method: 重新设计了编码器和隐式神经表示（INR）模块的基本架构，使其具备内在的旋转等变能力，并提供了理论分析以评估其等变误差。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在模拟和真实数据集上均表现出色，且能够以即插即用的方式集成到现有ASISR方法中，进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的旋转等变ASISR方法有效解决了低分辨率图像中几何模式变形的问题，为图像超分辨率任务提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: X-MoGen通过统一框架和形态一致性模块，成功解决了跨物种运动生成的挑战，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: PhysPatch为MLLM系统提供了高效的对抗攻击解决方案，并确保现实部署可行性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感图像地物提取的多模态视觉语言模型，显著提升了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoMatcher提出了一种通过大规模多域数据预训练的通用内窥镜图像匹配方法，解决了视觉条件复杂和数据稀缺的问题，并在多个数据集上显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的通用密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但由于视觉条件复杂（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺，仍具挑战性。

Method: EndoMatcher采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强鲁棒性；构建了首个多域内窥镜数据集Endo-Mix6，并提出渐进式多目标训练策略以解决训练稳定性问题。

Result: 在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上，EndoMatcher将内点匹配数量分别提升了140.69%和201.43%，在Gastro-Matching数据集上MDPA提升了9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher通过多域数据预训练和渐进式训练策略，实现了在未见器官和成像条件下的零样本泛化，显著提升了内窥镜图像匹配的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

TL;DR: VFlowOpt是一种视觉令牌剪枝框架，通过重要性图和渐进式剪枝模块减少计算成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉令牌冗余导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 提出重要性图推导和渐进式剪枝模块，结合视觉信息流优化剪枝策略。

Result: 剪枝90%视觉令牌，性能接近原始模型，减少89% KV-Cache内存，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt有效平衡了计算效率和模型性能，适用于多种LMMs。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中因数据隐私和传输成本导致的性能下降问题。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot设置下，平均分割精度分别提升2.18%和4.11%。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨域少样本分割任务中显著优于现有方法，且无需源域数据。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack框架显著提升了视觉语言跟踪性能，为任务提供了新基准。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Motivation: 传统方法及多数基于学习的方法假设气泡为近球形，难以处理变形、合并或破裂的气泡，尤其在空气润滑系统中。

Method: 将任务视为迁移学习问题，使用微调的SAM v2.1模型。

Result: 首次证明SAM v2.1能准确分割高度非凸、不规则的气泡结构。

Conclusion: 现代视觉基础模型为复杂气泡分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen是一种基于扩散的框架，用于从任意视角生成可控相机图像，通过FAVS和CVC-SSL解决缺乏真实数据的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶中任意视角图像生成潜力巨大，但缺乏真实数据限制了高保真生成模型的训练。

Method: 提出FAVS（分层匹配策略）和CVC-SSL（自监督学习），通过扩散模型实现跨视角一致性。

Result: 仅需多相机图像和姿态即可训练，无需额外传感器或深度图，支持多种车辆配置。

Conclusion: Arbiviewgen是首个支持可控任意视角相机图像生成的方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Conclusion: 区域感知对比预训练对多模态医学图像理解至关重要，RegionMed-CLIP为其提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Conclusion: CF3方法在效率和性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: SGDFuse通过语义引导的扩散模型解决了图像融合中的核心挑战，提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Motivation: 动态室外环境中的复杂物体交互及其随时间演变需要精确捕捉，4D LiDAR点云提供了丰富的时空信息，但在MLLMs中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了B4DL基准、可扩展的数据生成管道，以及一个直接处理原始4D LiDAR的MLLM模型。

Result: 模型和数据集为动态室外环境中的时空推理提供了统一解决方案。

Conclusion: B4DL填补了4D LiDAR在MLLMs中的空白，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated
dataset, and inference outputs on diverse scenarios at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），通过频域特征建模提升遥感图像中细微变化的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以检测细微变化区域。频域特征（尤其是小波域）能放大频率分组的差异，增强边缘变化的感知。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频成分，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID）；低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并通过渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）优化变化区域。最后融合高低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上，WGDF显著减轻边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过频域建模和特征融合，有效提升了遥感图像变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低资源语言的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）增强方法，强调语言能力和文化基础的双重目标，并通过MELLA数据集验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言中表现不佳，主要局限于文本模态或机器翻译，忽略了多模态信息和文化基础的重要性。

Method: 提出双源策略，分别收集文化相关的原生网络替代文本和语言相关的MLLM生成描述，构建MELLA数据集。

Result: 实验显示，在MELLA上微调后，模型在八种语言中表现普遍提升，生成更丰富的描述。

Conclusion: MELLA数据集通过增强文化知识和语言能力，显著提升了MLLM在低资源语言中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语义的抑郁评估方法（VS-LLM），用于自动分析PPAT草图，以支持心理学家进行大规模的心理状态评估。实验结果显示，该方法比心理学家评估方法提高了17.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPAT草图分析依赖心理学家的经验且耗时费力，因此需要一种自动化方法来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出VS-LLM方法，结合视觉和语义信息分析PPAT草图，并建立实验环境支持自动化分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，VS-LLM方法比心理学家评估方法提高了17.6%的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图的心理状态评估提供了高效且自动化的解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Motivation: 现有高效模型在分布外数据上性能下降明显，表明泛化能力不足，需改进架构设计。

Method: 引入Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA)机制，动态全局令牌增强局部-全局特征建模，提出CoCAViT。

Result: CoCAViT-28M在ImageNet-1K上达到84.0% top-1准确率，并在多个OOD基准测试中显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: CoCAViT在保持低延迟的同时，显著提升了小模型的泛化能力和多任务性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: mKG-RAG框架通过引入结构化多模态知识，有效提升了检索增强生成在视觉问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管预训练的视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现出色，但微调通常会丧失其自然语言查询和零样本能力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用类似文本反转（TI）的方法，通过学习新的或改进现有词嵌入，扩展VLM的词汇表，仅需少量示例即可检测新对象。

Result: 该方法在保持原始模型性能的同时，显著减少了计算资源需求，并在实验中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了微调导致的遗忘问题，同时保留了VLM的零样本能力，适用于开放词汇目标检测。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 3DGabSplat提出了一种基于3D Gabor的基元，解决了3DGS在高频细节表示和效率上的不足，显著提升了渲染质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS因高斯函数的低通特性无法有效捕捉高频细节，且存在冗余基元和内存开销问题。

Method: 利用多方向3D频率响应的3D Gabor基元表示辐射场，开发CUDA光栅化器和频率自适应机制。

Result: 实验显示3DGabSplat在PSNR上比3DGS提升1.35 dB，同时减少基元数量和内存消耗。

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat可作为即插即用模块提升现有3DGS的效率和质量，达到最先进的渲染效果。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉语言推理任务中难以有效建模视觉状态转换，导致推理不连贯。Uni-CoT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两级推理范式（宏微观CoT）和结构化训练，结合图像生成与理解能力，降低计算开销。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中达到SOTA性能，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且连贯的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Motivation: 现有方法多从单张图像生成报告，忽略了患者临床背景和先验图像等关键信息，无法捕捉诊断意图或疾病进展。

Method: PriorRG采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过先验引导的对比预训练提取时空特征；第二阶段通过先验感知的粗到细解码逐步整合先验知识。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和MIMIC-ABN数据集上，PriorRG表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和F1分数分别提升3.6%和3.8%。

Conclusion: PriorRG通过有效利用先验知识，显著提升了胸部X光报告的临床准确性和流畅性。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖昂贵标注，而模型预测的空间重叠模式隐含置信度信号，可用于提升定位精度。

Method: GUI-RC通过多预测空间投票网格识别共识区域；GUI-RCPO将一致性模式转化为奖励，用于推理时自监督优化。

Result: GUI-RC提升ScreenSpot基准2-3%；GUI-RCPO进一步优化Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct至85.14%。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展和强化学习为GUI定位提供数据高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨视角定位中缺乏冗余观测和可靠性验证的问题。

Method: 将查询图像切片生成多个3-DoF位姿，通过几何刚性公式和NFA模型筛选并合并有效位姿。

Result: 在DReSS数据集上，Slice-Loc将平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米，方向误差从3.42°降至1.24°。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc显著提升了定位精度和可靠性，适用于GNSS失效环境下的智能车辆定位。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，F1分数比现有方法提升7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过显式建模解剖知识显著提升了放射报告生成的性能。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性，传统GNN依赖静态图拓扑且忽视物理空间位置，注意力机制缺乏特异性。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力机制能有效捕捉WSIs和ROIs中的复杂空间结构。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCAGE的无训练方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，提升了文本到图像生成中的组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型和掩码生成变换器在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但在组合生成中仍存在属性绑定和文本-图像对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，通过对比注意力引导优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，无需额外训练。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准和指标上均显著提升了组合保真度，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: UNCAGE是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著改善了文本到图像生成的组合能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制难以在不损害数据效用的情况下精确识别和缓解投毒图像，影响了系统的可靠性。

Method: 利用多个先进视觉语言模型的多数投票机制检测投毒图像，并通过校准噪声修正。

Result: TrueBiometric能100%准确检测并修正投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的识别准确率。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为防御人脸识别系统中的后门攻击提供了更实用、准确和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 物理对抗性伪装对安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）构成威胁，现有技术因环境变化和梯度冲突而效果不佳。

Method: 引入梯度校准策略确保梯度一致性，开发梯度去相关方法消除冗余更新，提升多角度优化的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在攻击成功率上平均提升13.46%（距离）和11.03%（角度），显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了物理对抗性伪装的挑战，同时强调了现实场景中系统设计的鲁棒性需求。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

TL;DR: SmoothSA改进Slot Attention（SA）在对象中心学习（OCL）中的表现，通过预热冷启动查询和区分视频帧的变换，提升对象聚合的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，影响图像或视频首帧的精确聚合；非首帧查询已具备样本信息，需要不同的变换方式。

Method: SmoothSA通过自蒸馏模块预热冷启动查询，并在视频帧中区分首帧和非首帧的变换方式（全迭代和单迭代）。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，直观展示了如何平滑SA的迭代和循环。

Conclusion: SmoothSA显著提升了SA在OCL中的性能，为对象聚合提供了更平滑的解决方案。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性图仅捕获一阶归因，忽略了跨模态交互的复杂性，需要更全面的解释方法。

Method: 提出FIxLIP，基于博弈论中的加权Banzhaf交互指数，分解视觉-语言编码器的相似性。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP优于一阶归因方法，并可用于模型比较。

Conclusion: FIxLIP提供高质量解释，并能有效比较不同模型，为跨模态交互分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决传统基于流的方法在模型表达能力上的限制，提出更高效的无监督异常检测方法。

Method: 引入时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）插值，构建非概率演化路径以增强对样本轨迹的动态控制。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度下的最先进性能。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持的高效分离机制，并展示了其计算可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Result: F2PASeg能实时、鲁棒地分割关键解剖结构，适应术中变化。

Conclusion: F2PASeg为垂体手术规划提供了可靠解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Motivation: 先前研究表明图像压缩可防御对抗扰动，但缺乏全面攻击评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建强白盒和自适应攻击，评估多种压缩模型的抗攻击能力。

Result: 高保真压缩模型抗攻击能力强，低保真模型易被攻破，原因是分布一致性而非梯度掩蔽。

Conclusion: 高保真压缩模型提供固有鲁棒性，未来对抗攻击需克服高保真性挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

<details>

Motivation: 历史地图缺乏一致性，预训练基础模型难以直接应用，需要一种方法引导模型识别多变的地图模式。

Method: 提出OND知识提示机制，替换SAM模型的提示编码器，并微调以适应历史地图分割任务。

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND定义的类别，并通过少量样本适应新类别，性能优于UNet基线。

Conclusion: OND知识提示机制有效提升了历史地图分割的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Conclusion: 该方法成功填补了形状分析中手性特征提取的空白，为相关任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖物体模板或假设物体完全可见，但在实际场景中，固定视角和静态抓握会导致物体部分不可见，重建结果不真实。

Method: MagicHOI利用大规模新视角合成扩散模型提供物体监督，结合可见接触约束对齐手和物体。

Result: MagicHOI在3D手-物体重建任务中显著优于现有方法，新视角合成先验有效规范了不可见区域。

Conclusion: MagicHOI通过新视角合成先验和接触约束，提升了有限视角下手-物体重建的准确性。

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The

Result: 在遮挡严重的拥挤环境中，提供了更鲁棒的多目标跟踪解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过改进外观和运动建模，显著提升了遮挡场景下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

*Ekaterina Shumitskaya,Dmitriy Vatolin,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间随机平滑的新型图像质量评估（IQA）模型认证防御方法，相比直接在输入空间添加噪声的方法，保留了图像质量并提供鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入图像中直接添加高斯噪声会降低视觉质量，而新方法通过在特征空间添加噪声，既保持了图像保真度，又提供了鲁棒性认证。

Method: 分析了主干网络雅可比矩阵的最大奇异值，将特征空间噪声水平与输入空间扰动关联起来，适用于全参考和无参考IQA模型，无需修改架构。

Result: 在两种基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法，推理时间减少99.5%（无认证）和20.6%（有认证），与主观质量分数的相关性提升高达30.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了IQA模型的鲁棒性和效率，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

TL;DR: Octozi是一个结合大型语言模型和领域特定启发式方法的AI平台，显著提升临床试验数据清理效率，减少错误和假阳性查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验数据清理是药物开发的关键瓶颈，传统手动方法难以应对数据量和复杂性的增加。

Method: Octozi结合大型语言模型和领域特定启发式方法，辅助临床数据审查。

Result: AI辅助使数据清理吞吐量提高6.03倍，错误率从54.67%降至8.48%，假阳性查询减少15.48倍。

Conclusion: AI辅助方法可解决临床试验操作中的低效问题，加速药物开发并降低成本，同时保持合规性。

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Optimal Brain Connection的结构剪枝框架，通过Jacobian Criterion评估参数重要性，并利用Equivalent Pruning机制保留原始连接贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构剪枝方法常忽略参数间的相互联系，导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 提出Jacobian Criterion，评估结构参数重要性；2. 引入Equivalent Pruning机制，通过自编码器保留原始连接贡献。

Result: Jacobian Criterion在保留模型性能上优于其他方法，Equivalent Pruning有效减少微调后的性能下降。

Conclusion: Optimal Brain Connection框架在结构剪枝中表现出色，兼顾参数交互和性能保留。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSTGNN是一种轻量化的空间-频谱-时序图神经网络框架，用于检测AI生成和篡改视频，通过联合分析空间、时序和频谱信息，显著优于现有方法且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检测方法难以泛化到多种篡改类型，且依赖大模型。SSTGNN旨在通过结构化图表示和多模态联合推理解决这些问题。

Method: SSTGNN将视频表示为结构化图，结合可学习频谱滤波器和时序差分建模，捕捉篡改痕迹。

Result: SSTGNN在多种数据集上表现优异，参数减少42.4倍，具有强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSTGNN是一种高效、轻量化的视频篡改检测框架，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 随着在线视频内容的爆炸式增长，人工审核不安全视频的需求已超出人类能力范围，亟需自动化解决方案。MLLMs在多模态内容审核中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文引入了一个新的多模态多语言数据集，并通过比较分析评估了Gemini、GPT和Llama等MLLMs在品牌安全分类中的表现。

Result: 研究表明MLLMs在品牌安全分类中具有潜力，但其准确性和成本效率仍需改进。论文还揭示了MLLMs的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文为未来研究提供了数据集，并呼吁进一步探索高效且负责任的内容审核方法。

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Action Discovery的新方法，用于解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和未标注动作的问题，通过两步法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决部分标注数据集中已知动作和未知动作的识别问题，特别是在神经科学等领域中常见的行为标注不完整情况。

Method: 采用两步法：1) Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) 用于时间分割；2) Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) 用于语义分类。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly三个数据集上验证，性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Action Discovery方法有效解决了部分标注数据集中的动作识别问题，为模糊和未标注动作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）对高质量、多样化和可扩展数据的需求日益增长，但大规模真实数据收集成本高且耗时，限制了应用发展。

Method: 通过MLLM-Collector收集资产和描述，利用MLLM-Generator和MLLM-Optimizer构建3D布局并进行语义优化，最后用MLLM-Planner生成时间连贯的未来帧。

Result: 实验表明，合成数据显著提升了现有基线模型的性能。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction作为一种可扩展且高效的数据引擎，具有推动生成智能发展的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART框架通过自适应模块增强VLP模型，结合弱监督定位和LLM知识，提升开放词汇多标签识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖关系建模上的不足，提升开放词汇多标签识别的性能。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含自适应细化模块（ARM）和自适应转移模块（ATM），结合弱监督损失和LLM知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DART有效整合外部知识和自适应模块，显著提升开放词汇多标签识别能力。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: WeTok是一种新型视觉分词器，通过分组无查找量化和生成解码技术，显著提升了压缩比和重建保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间存在不理想的权衡，WeTok旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）两项核心技术。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok实现了最低的零样本rFID（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在性能和压缩效率上均超越现有方法，为视觉生成提供了更优的分词解决方案。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Motivation: 图像-文本相关性评估是衡量生成AI响应质量的关键，但现有方法难以处理多样化的文本格式和场景定义。

Method: 采用LLaVA架构，结合详细任务指令和多模态上下文样本，构建LLaVA-RE模型。

Result: 实验验证了LLaVA-RE框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D内容质量评估方法主要依赖基于图像的指标，且仅关注对象级别，无法全面评估空间一致性、材料真实性和局部细节。

Method: 提出Hi3DEval框架，结合对象级和部分级评估，并扩展纹理评估至材料真实性；构建Hi3DBench数据集和多代理标注流程；提出基于混合3D表示的自动评分系统。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在建模3D特性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于现有基于图像的指标。

Conclusion: Hi3DEval为3D生成内容提供了可扩展的评估方案，优于传统手动评估方法。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

TL;DR: MOSEv2是一个更复杂的视频对象分割数据集，旨在推动真实场景下的VOS研究，包含更多挑战性场景，如遮挡、恶劣天气等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOS数据集主要包含显著、孤立的对象，限制了在真实场景中的泛化能力。MOSEv2旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MOSEv2包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码，涵盖200个类别，增加了场景复杂性和新挑战。

Result: 在MOSEv2上，20种VOS方法和9种跟踪方法性能显著下降，表明现有方法在真实场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MOSEv2为VOS研究提供了更真实的测试环境，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

Conclusion: GAP为点云到高斯的生成任务提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别技术的发展，隐私保护需求日益突出，现有的人脸匿名化方法无法满足生物识别模板保护的可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性要求。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，并通过多目标损失函数优化，生成高质量的可取消人脸图像。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer在保持高识别精度的同时，提供了更强的隐私保护，商业API上的性能提升了11%以上。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer是一种高效的人脸隐私保护方法，能够在保持识别功能的同时满足生物识别模板保护的所有要求。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

Method: 开发了LCB-RB基准和OD-based奖励模型训练方法，并提出了P-GRPO算法，选择性奖励成功任务的推理过程。

Result: 7B参数模型在代码生成任务中表现优异，超越基线4.5%，与GPT-4-Turbo相当，并可推广至数学任务。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了奖励欺骗问题，提升了推理质量与最终结果的匹配度。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

*Wuqiang Zheng,Yiyan Xu,Xinyu Lin,Chongming Gao,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PaperEval是一个基于LLM的自动化论文评估框架，通过领域感知检索和潜在推理机制提升评估质量，实验和实际应用效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版物快速增长，识别高质量研究成为挑战，现有LLM方法因知识过时和推理能力有限而受限。

Method: PaperEval包含领域感知检索模块和潜在推理机制，采用渐进排名优化策略迭代优化预测。

Result: 实验显示PaperEval在学术影响和论文质量评估上优于现有方法，实际应用中获得了高用户参与度。

Conclusion: PaperEval通过创新设计解决了LLM在论文评估中的局限性，展现了实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

Motivation: 探索语音大语言模型在低资源语言环境中的适用性，解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用SLAM-ASR框架，通过轻量级可训练投影器连接语音编码器与大语言模型，评估数据量需求及多语言预训练的效果。

Conclusion: 研究为优化低资源语言和多语言环境下的语音LLM提供了方向，强调了预训练和多语言模型的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a
trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly,
we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

TL;DR: 论文通过分析LLM在RTL代码生成中的错误原因，提出针对性修正技术，显著提升了生成准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的RTL代码生成成功率低，缺乏对错误原因的深入理解，阻碍了改进。

Method: 进行错误分析并分类，采用领域知识库、检索增强生成、设计描述规则和外部工具转换多模态输入，结合迭代调试循环。

Result: 改进后的框架在VerilogEval基准测试中达到91.0%准确率，比基线方法提升32.7%。

Conclusion: 针对特定错误原因的修正技术能显著提升LLM在RTL代码生成中的性能。

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像检索研究存在样本量不足、数据分割不当和统计验证不足等问题，阻碍了临床转化。

Method: 采用DenseNet121、ResNet50和VGG16等CNN架构，结合精细调优、度量学习和超级集成优化等策略，使用严格的分层数据分割和统计验证。

Result: DenseNet121和ResNet50的精确度分别提升19.64%和19.58%，超级集成优化达到36.33%的精确度，显著优于文献中的预期。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床诊断支持提供了性能基准和架构选择指南，显著提升了5类医学检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GMM方法依赖外部共识图或原子模型初始化，限制了其独立使用。cryoGS旨在解决这一问题，实现从原始图像直接重建。

Method: cryoGS结合高斯溅射和冷冻电镜成像物理模型，开发了正交投影感知的高斯溅射技术，并引入归一化项和FFT对齐坐标系。

Result: 实验证明cryoGS在真实数据集上表现优于基线方法，具有高效和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cryoGS为冷冻电镜重建提供了一种无需外部初始化的高效解决方案，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的伪影影响诊断准确性，传统基于图像的方法因预处理导致信息丢失和内存需求高，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: 利用INRs提供紧凑连续的图像表示，结合深度权重空间网络、图神经网络和关系注意力变换器进行图像质量评估。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了较少的参数下达到相似性能。

Conclusion: INRs为医学图像质量评估提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spitz肿瘤与常规黑色素瘤在组织学特征上重叠，诊断困难，需探索AI辅助诊断的潜力。

Method: 使用393例Spitz肿瘤和379例常规黑色素瘤数据集开发AI模型，比较其与四位病理学家的表现，并进行模拟实验评估AI对病理工作流程的影响。

Result: AI模型在区分任务中表现最佳（AUROC 0.95），基因异常和诊断类别预测准确率分别为0.55和0.51，优于随机猜测和病理学家。模拟实验显示AI可降低成本和时间。

Conclusion: AI模型在Spitz肿瘤诊断中表现优异，尤其在区分任务中，未来可优化病理工作流程。

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上广泛存在，对社会和个人造成严重危害，需要开发高效的自动检测方法。

Method: 研究采用Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa、GPT-2和ELECTRA）对MetaHate数据集（包含120万样本）进行仇恨言论检测。

Result: 微调后的ELECTRA模型表现最佳（F1分数：0.8980），但分类错误揭示了讽刺、隐晦语言和标签噪声的挑战。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在仇恨言论检测中表现出色，但仍需解决讽刺和隐晦语言等问题。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音同步翻译系统中翻译质量与延迟之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出REINA损失函数，基于信息理论训练自适应策略，利用非流式翻译模型优化流式翻译。

Result: 在多语言任务中实现了最先进的性能，延迟与质量权衡效率提升高达21%。

Conclusion: REINA策略显著优化了语音同步翻译系统的性能，为延迟与质量的平衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

TL;DR: R-Zero是一种完全自主的框架，通过两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver）的交互生成训练数据，无需人工标注，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练方法依赖人工标注任务，限制了AI超越人类智能的发展。R-Zero旨在通过自主生成数据解决这一瓶颈。

Method: R-Zero初始化两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver），通过交互优化：Challenger提出任务，Solver解决任务，形成自我改进的课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了推理能力，例如在数学推理和通用领域推理基准上分别提升了6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为LLM的自主进化提供了可行路径，突破了依赖人工标注的限制。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练方法在函数调用任务中表现不佳，监督微调依赖表面模式匹配，而标准强化学习方法难以处理结构化函数调用的复杂动作空间。

Method: 采用两阶段数据准备流程，结合迭代LLM评估和抽象语法树验证，设计了基于策略熵探索的强化学习框架。

Result: 在Berkeley函数调用排行榜上达到86.02%的准确率，比标准GRPO方法提升6%，尤其在代码预训练模型上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为函数调用任务提供了更优的强化学习起点，代码和数据集将开源以推动社区发展。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时忽略了计算成本与对齐质量的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于基线方法，且在低预算下仍有效。

Conclusion: HIA为可扩展、个性化的LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

TL;DR: Fairy±i提出了一种新的2位量化框架，通过提升全精度模型的性能并利用复数域的优势，首次突破了量化误差的精度上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QAT研究仅关注最小化全精度模型的量化误差，未尝试超越其精度上限。本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: 利用复数域的表征优势，将权重映射到四次单位根{±1, ±i}，实现对称且信息最优的2位表示，支持无乘法推理。

Result: Fairy±i在PPL和下游任务中超越了现有2位量化方法的精度上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为极低位约束下构建高精度实用LLM开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

Conclusion: LLMs在生成CPs方面具有潜力，可扩展临床决策支持，改善高血压患者护理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中分布偏移和数据不平衡问题日益突出，但缺乏统一的评估平台，阻碍了公平和系统的比较。

Method: 开发ALScope平台，整合多领域数据集和代表性算法，支持灵活配置实验条件。

Result: 实验表明：(1)算法性能因领域和任务设置而异；(2)非标准场景下算法仍有改进空间；(3)部分算法性能好但耗时较长。

Conclusion: ALScope为深度主动学习提供了全面评估工具，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现和局限性。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

<details>

Motivation: 预训练权重是现代深度学习的基石，但在数据稀缺场景下，如何获取更丰富的知识仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 利用结构化遗忘及其逆过程，通过逐步缩小数据集进行微调，建模权重演变并预测知识增强的权重。

Result: 实验表明，KNOW预测在多种数据集和架构上优于传统微调和简单权重预测方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为重新解释遗忘动态提供了新视角，推动了深度学习中的知识传递极限。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Method: 采用P2P拓扑结构，通过本地验证集计算一致性分数，选择个性化更新并引入正则化。

Result: 在两个数据集上优于集中式基线和其他P2P方法，尤其在对抗性和异构条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR框架显著提升了联邦学习的性能和鲁棒性，适用于异构和对抗性环境。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 解决半监督持续学习中无标签学习、记忆稳定性和学习塑性之间的复杂平衡问题。

Method: 提出USP框架，包括特征空间保留策略（FSR）、分治伪标记方法（DCP）和类均值锚定无标签蒸馏（CUD）。

Result: USP在最终准确率上比现有方法提升高达5.94%。

Conclusion: USP有效解决了半监督持续学习中的关键挑战，并在实验中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

Conclusion: 提出的算法在多视图聚类中表现出高效性和自动化优势，为复杂数据模式发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Conclusion: 填补了无监督VLM适应领域的综述空白，为未来研究提供了框架和方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An
actively maintained repository of relevant literature is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）面临数据样本需完美对齐和需所有客户联合推理的限制，X-VFL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了Cross Completion（XCom）补全缺失特征和Decision Subspace Alignment（DS-Align）对齐决策子空间，支持局部独立推理。

Result: 实验显示X-VFL在CIFAR-10和MIMIC-III数据集上分别提升15%和43%的准确率。

Conclusion: X-VFL在部分缺失特征和局部独立推理场景中表现出色，验证了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges
and future directions for advancing language-guided 3D scene understanding

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory
efficiency and high visual quality while maintaining real-time rendering speed.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂动态场景重建中表现优异，保真度更高。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态3DGS的频谱冲突问题，实现了更高质量的重建。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: RAP提出了一种实时音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过混合注意力机制和静态-动态训练范式，实现了高质量、低延迟的动画生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因计算复杂无法实时部署，而压缩表示又难以保留细节和同步性，因此需要一种兼顾质量和效率的解决方案。

Method: RAP采用混合注意力机制实现精细音频控制，并通过静态-动态训练范式避免显式运动监督。

Result: 实验表明，RAP在实时约束下实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RAP为实时音频驱动肖像动画提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

*Mohamed Abdul Gafoor,Marius Preda,Titus Zaharia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于惯性体积的新型密度控制方法，改进了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的点基元管理，提升了新视角合成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS中自适应密度控制（ADC）的不足，优化点基元管理以提高重建质量。

Method: 利用高斯函数的惯性体积指导密度控制，并比较了传统SfM和深度图像匹配（DIM）的点云初始化效果。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，新方法在重建质量上优于3DGS，表现稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的密度控制方法有效提升了3DGS的性能，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across
diverse scenes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实扫描数据集上均能有效提升服装分割的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为服装人体建模提供了更精确的语义分割方法，尤其在多层服装处理上表现突出。

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将3D图形工具中的物理光照控制能力扩展到真实场景的重照明中。

Method: 通过单目估计几何和本征组件推断场景的彩色网格表示，结合路径追踪引擎和神经渲染器实现光照编辑。

Result: 实现了逼真的重照明效果，并在自监督训练中重建了真实场景的光照。

Conclusion: 该方法为真实场景的光照编辑提供了物理精确且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注攻击成功率（ASR），而忽略了攻击输出是否真正满足恶意意图，导致低质量输出。

Method: JPS结合目标导向的视觉扰动和多代理优化的文本提示，通过迭代协同优化实现攻击。

Result: JPS在ASR和MIFR上均达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: JPS为多模态大语言模型的越狱攻击提供了高效且意图明确的解决方案。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业机械维护需要及时干预以防止灾难性故障并优化运行效率，传统方法仅能检测异常，无法提供具体维护建议。

Method: 系统将轴承振动数据（BPFO、BPFI、BSF、FTF频率）转化为自然语言供LLM处理，结合多代理组件分析维护手册和网络搜索，生成结构化维护建议。

Result: 实验验证表明，系统能有效检测异常并提供上下文相关的维护指导，填补了状态监测与可操作维护计划之间的空白。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用，为跨机械组件和工业领域的预测性维护提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）解决方案存在隐私和可扩展性问题，需要持续互联网连接。本研究旨在探索更高效、隐私友好的替代方案。

Method: 比较了三种方法：（1）基于云LLM的在线方法；（2）基于传统机器学习分类器的半自动化离线方法；（3）基于客户端SLM的完全离线方法。

Result: 客户端SLM方法在精确匹配（0.93）、Levenshtein相似度（0.99）和ROUGE评分（0.98）上表现最佳，同时减轻了服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端SLM方法为AWebGIS提供了高效、隐私保护的解决方案，展示了浏览器可执行模型的可行性。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Result: HealthFlow在复杂医疗数据分析任务中表现优于现有框架。

Conclusion: 研究推动了从工具使用者到自我进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规则方法无法覆盖所有边缘案例，机器学习需大量标注数据，LLMs有望提供更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 分析了LLMs的空间推理能力，提出结合特征减少推理依赖，并采用“审查-优化”方法修正错误。

Result: LLMs在减少空间推理依赖时表现优异，“审查-优化”方法能有效修正错误。

Conclusion: LLMs是传统规则方法的灵活替代，未来可结合多模态方法进一步优化。

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

Motivation: Web导航是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的重要领域，但现有方法未能有效整合离线学习和在线探索。论文旨在通过双系统认知理论解决这一问题。

Method: 提出CogniWeb框架，将任务分解为快速直觉（System 1）和慢速推理（System 2）过程，并根据任务复杂度自适应切换。

Result: 在WebArena上的实验显示，CogniWeb实现了43.96%的成功率，同时显著提高了效率（减少75%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 通过双系统认知理论，CogniWeb成功整合了离线与在线学习，为Web导航智能体提供了高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

Method: 引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在Meta CRAG-MM挑战中，QA-Dragon显著提升推理性能，单源、多源和多轮任务分别提升5.06%、6.35%和5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态混合检索策略，有效提升复杂VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号与神经模块松散耦合的问题，实现更紧密的集成，以支持可解释的规则推理和上下文推断。

Method: 设计了一个统一推理系统，将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入，LLM智能体处理归纳推理和规划，中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%）。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前AI评估工具未能覆盖欧盟AI法案关注的系统性风险，亟需填补这一“基准-监管差距”。

Method: 使用LLM-as-judge分析，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类中。

Result: 发现评估工具过度关注行为倾向（如幻觉倾向、歧视性偏见），而忽视关键功能能力（如失控场景）。

Conclusion: 研究为政策制定者和开发者提供了量化分析，助力更安全、合规的AI发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Method: 利用小型通用LLM生成六种新数据集，补充三大ERC基准。

Result: 生成数据集显著提升ERC分类器性能，增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 低成本LLM生成的数据集有效解决ERC数据不足问题，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for

### [187] [Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05012)

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种语言和运行时系统，旨在解决现代LLM流程中提示管理的问题，通过结构化、自适应和一等执行模型组件的方式，实现运行时提示优化和管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM流程中，提示（prompt）作为核心元素却仍是一个脆弱、不透明的字符串，与数据流脱节，限制了重用、优化和运行时控制。

Method: SPEAR提出了一种提示代数，支持运行时提示动态调整（如基于置信度、延迟等信号）和结构化提示管理（如版本化视图、日志记录）。

Result: 初步实验量化了不同提示优化模式（手动、辅助、自动）与静态提示和代理重试的对比，以及提示级优化（如操作符融合）的效果。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过结构化提示管理，为LLM流程提供了更灵活、高效的提示优化和控制能力。

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

TL;DR: MICoBot是一个用于人机协作的混合主动对话系统，通过三层决策机制优化任务分配，显著提升任务成功率和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作中因人类伙伴行为多变、意愿和能力变化带来的适应性挑战。

Method: 采用混合主动对话范式，结合元规划器、任务分配器和动作执行器三层决策机制。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，MICoBot显著优于纯LLM基线和其他任务分配模型。

Conclusion: MICoBot通过灵活的任务分配和对话机制，有效提升人机协作的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务感知视角规划（TAVP）框架，通过主动视角规划和任务特定表示学习，解决了现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在3D感知和任务干扰上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型依赖静态视角和共享视觉编码器，限制了3D感知并导致任务干扰，影响了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: TAVP结合主动视角规划和任务特定表示学习，采用高效探索策略和新型伪环境加速视角获取，并引入混合专家（MoE）视觉编码器解耦任务特征。

Result: 在RLBench任务上，TAVP显著优于固定视角方法，生成了更完整和区分性的视觉表示，提升了动作预测能力。

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视角规划和表示学习，显著提升了多任务机器人操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

TL;DR: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿提升端到端自动驾驶模型的鲁棒性，减少碰撞率并提高闭环性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶模型过于关注自车状态，缺乏规划导向的理解，限制了决策过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于结构化场景表示的规划模型作为教师模型，结合强化学习和生成建模优化状态到决策的映射。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上，碰撞率降低50%，闭环性能提升3分。

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多目标学习显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习训练的移动机器人在面对分布外场景时性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用自适应共形推理生成预测不确定性估计，并通过约束强化学习引导机器人行为。

Result: 在分布内场景中，成功率提高8.80%，碰撞和侵入人类轨迹次数显著减少；在分布外场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实机器人实验中验证了其安全性和鲁棒性，适用于稀疏和密集人群。

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for
robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and
simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is
a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the
spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in
a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent
representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight,
flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference
across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable
evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural
simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development.
The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite
measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action
alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable
and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied
intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.
