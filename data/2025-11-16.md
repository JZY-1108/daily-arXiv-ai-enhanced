Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omnilingual ASR是首个专为可扩展性设计的大规模自动语音识别系统，通过自监督预训练和编码器-解码器架构，仅需少量样本即可支持新语言，覆盖1600多种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高资源语言ASR快速发展而7000多种语言中大多数缺乏支持的现状，突破传统架构限制和伦理问题，实现语言包容性。

Method: 采用7B参数的自监督预训练学习鲁棒语音表示，引入LLM启发的编码器-解码器架构实现零样本泛化，结合大规模多样化训练语料和社区合作收集数据。

Result: 覆盖1600多种语言（其中500多种首次获得ASR支持），在低资源条件下显著优于现有系统，提供从300M到7B的模型系列。

Conclusion: 开源模型和工具可降低研究者和社区的门槛，促进参与，同时强调设计中的伦理考量和社会影响。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has advanced in high-resource languages, but most of the world's 7,000+ languages remain unsupported, leaving thousands of long-tail languages behind. Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation. Open-source artifacts are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/omnilingual-asr.

### [2] [Order Matters: Rethinking Prompt Construction in In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09700)
*Warren Li,Yiqian Wang,Zihan Wang,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现示例顺序对上下文学习性能的影响与示例选择相当重要，挑战了传统认为示例选择更重要的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视上下文学习中示例选择与示例顺序的相对重要性，因为大多数研究都假设示例选择比顺序更重要。

Method: 在分类和生成任务上进行控制实验，使用多个开源模型家族（0.5B到27B参数）和GPT-5，系统比较示例选择和排序的影响。

Result: 不同示例顺序导致的性能差异与使用完全不同示例集的效果相当，且可以通过开发集识别强顺序，接近基于测试标签选择最佳顺序的性能。

Conclusion: 示例选择和排序在提示设计中具有同等且相互交织的重要性，需要重新审视上下文学习中的假设。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to perform new tasks by conditioning on a sequence of examples. Most prior work reasonably and intuitively assumes that which examples are chosen has a far greater effect on performance than how those examples are ordered, leading to a focus on example selection. We revisit this assumption and conduct a systematic comparison between the effect of selection and ordering. Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels. Our findings highlight the equal and intertwined importance of example selection and ordering in prompt design, calling for a reexamination of the assumptions held in ICL.

### [3] [Contextual morphologically-guided tokenization for Latin encoder models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09709)
*Marisa Hudspeth,Patrick J. Burns,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，发现基于形态学的分词能提升下游任务性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现更好，证明了语言资源对形态复杂语言建模的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词方法通常优先考虑信息理论目标而非语言学目标，对形态丰富的语言效果不佳。拉丁语作为形态丰富但预训练数据中等、词典资源丰富的语言，是研究形态感知分词的理想案例。

Method: 开发了针对拉丁语的形态感知分词方法，利用该语言丰富的词典资源来指导分词过程，使其更符合形态学结构。

Result: 形态引导的分词在四个下游任务上提高了整体性能，特别是在领域外文本上表现提升最明显，显示了模型泛化能力的改善。

Conclusion: 对于缺乏大规模预训练数据的低资源语言，开发和整合语言资源可以作为提升语言模型性能的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical component of language model pretraining, yet standard tokenization methods often prioritize information-theoretical goals like high compression and low fertility rather than linguistic goals like morphological alignment. In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages. For low-resource languages that lack large-scale pretraining data, the development and incorporation of linguistic resources can serve as a feasible alternative to improve LM performance.

*C. LeMay,A. Lane,J. Seales,M. Winstead,S. Baty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP在从里根到克林顿政府时期的总统指令中提取主要主题的应用，比较了NLP与人工分析的结果，发现两者都能识别相关文档，但存在差异，表明需要进一步验证NLP在此类应用中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLP在处理大规模书面语料库中的潜力，特别是在识别总统指令中的信号主题方面，以评估NLP在社会科学研究中的实用性。

Method: 使用NLP技术从里根到克林顿政府的总统指令中提取主要主题，并与人工分析结果进行比较。

Result: NLP和人工分析都能识别相关文档，证明NLP在大规模书面语料研究中的潜在效用，但两者结果存在差异。

Conclusion: 虽然NLP展示了在社会科学应用中的内在能力，但由于AI/ML领域的快速发展，现有工具可能已过时，需要更多研究来验证NLP在此类用例中的有效性。

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

### [5] [How Small Can You Go? Compact Language Models for On-Device Critical Error Detection in Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09748)
*Muskaan Chopra,Lorenz Sparrenberg,Sarthak Khanna,Rafet Sifa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现10亿参数左右的小型语言模型（如Gemma-3-1B）在机器翻译关键错误检测任务中能达到最佳质量效率平衡，在保持低计算成本的同时实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然擅长评估机器翻译，但其规模和成本限制了在边缘设备和隐私敏感工作流中的部署。研究旨在探索在保持检测意义改变翻译错误能力的前提下，模型可以小到什么程度。

Method: 使用多个小于20亿参数的模型进行基准测试，采用标准化提示、轻量级logit-bias校准和多数投票方法，在WMT21、WMT22和SynCED-EnDe-2025数据集上评估语义质量和计算指标。

Result: Gemma-3-1B在质量效率权衡方面表现最佳，在SynCED-EnDe-2025上达到MCC=0.77和F1-ERR=0.98，在MacBook Pro M4 Pro上保持400ms单样本延迟。Qwen-3-1.7B获得最高绝对MCC但计算成本更高。

Conclusion: 经过指令调优的紧凑LLM结合轻量级校准和小样本监督，能够为机器翻译提供可信赖的端侧关键错误检测，实现隐私保护、低成本的实时翻译流程错误筛查。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at evaluating machine translation (MT), but their scale and cost hinder deployment on edge devices and in privacy-sensitive workflows. We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines. All datasets, prompts, and scripts are publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [6] [Predicate-Argument Structure Divergences in Chinese and English Parallel Sentences and their Impact on Language Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09796)
*Rocco Tripodi,Xiaoyu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了中英文平行句中的谓词-论元结构，发现语言迁移具有不对称性，这对跨语言NLP中的源语言选择具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言NLP在低资源场景中很实用，但语言差异（特别是类型学距离较远的语言）阻碍了语言迁移。本文旨在分析中英文谓词-论元结构的对齐情况。

Method: 通过注释投影实验，将一种语言作为源语言向平行句投影注释，进行定性和定量分析，并提出结构差异的分类方法。

Result: 分析结果显示语言迁移具有明显的不对称性，源语言的选择对迁移效果有重要影响。

Conclusion: 在跨语言NLP应用中，源语言的选择需要仔细考虑，任何关于跨语言NLP的科学论断都需要先进行此类不对称性研究。

Abstract: Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained significant traction in recent years, offering practical solutions in low-resource settings by transferring linguistic knowledge from resource-rich to low-resource languages. This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric. An aspect that requires attention when it comes to selecting the source language in transfer learning applications and that needs to be investigated before any scientific claim about cross-lingual NLP is proposed.

### [7] [TARG: Training-Free Adaptive Retrieval Gating for Efficient RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09803)
*Yufeng Wang,Lu wei,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TARG是一种无需训练的检索门控方法，通过分析基础模型短文本草稿的不确定性分数，智能决定何时进行检索，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少检索次数和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法对每个查询都进行检索，虽然提高了事实准确性，但增加了计算开销和延迟，影响效率。

Method: 使用基础模型生成短文本草稿，从草稿的前缀对数中计算轻量级不确定性分数（平均token熵、top-1/top-2对数间隙的边际信号、少量随机前缀的方差），仅在分数超过阈值时触发检索。

Result: 在NQ-Open、TriviaQA和PopQA数据集上，TARG相比Always-RAG在保持或提升EM/F1的同时，减少70-90%的检索次数，显著降低端到端延迟。

Conclusion: TARG提供了一种模型无关、无需训练的检索门控方案，在现代指令调优LLM下，边际信号是稳健的默认选择，小N方差提供了保守的预算优先替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factuality but retrieving for every query often hurts quality while inflating tokens and latency. We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.

### [8] [Khmer Spellchecking: A Holistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09812)
*Marry Kong,Rina Buoy,Sovisal Chenda,Nguonly Taing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种综合方法解决高棉语拼写检查问题，通过整合子词分割、命名实体识别、字素到音素转换和语言模型，实现了94.4%的最新准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高棉语拼写检查面临词汇表与分词模型不对齐、单词多种书写形式、复合词灵活构成以及缺乏命名实体识别模型等挑战，现有解决方案无法充分应对这些问题。

Method: 采用综合方法，整合高棉语子词分割、命名实体识别、字素到音素转换和语言模型，识别潜在修正候选并排序最优选项。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在高棉语拼写检查任务上达到94.4%的最新准确率，优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的综合方法有效解决了高棉语拼写检查的多重挑战，并为该领域提供了公开的基准数据集。

Abstract: Compared to English and other high-resource languages, spellchecking for Khmer remains an unresolved problem due to several challenges. First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合数据分析和机器学习的课程推荐系统，帮助学生选择符合行业趋势的课程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生选择相关课程的挑战，弥合大学学习与行业期望之间的差距

Method: 使用数据挖掘和协同过滤技术，结合机器学习算法、用户偏好和学术标准构建算法框架

Result: 开发了具有易用前端界面的推荐系统，通过迭代原型和用户反馈不断优化

Conclusion: 该系统可作为学生、教师和职业顾问的有用工具，促进终身学习和职业发展

Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of selecting relevant courses for students by proposing the design and development of a course recommendation system. The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations. We hope that the proposed course recommendation system will help university students in making data-drive and industry-informed course decisions, in turn, improving graduate outcomes for the university sector.

*Neo Wang,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于RAG和微调LLM的课程论坛问答系统，解决学生问题响应延迟和重复问题，在HotpotQA数据集上表现良好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 课程论坛中学生问题数量激增导致响应延迟和重复问题，需要自动化解决方案来减轻教师负担

Method: 使用开源LLM微调课程数据，结合RAG方法从本地知识库检索相关文档，并集成多链思维推理减少幻觉

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上的实验表明，微调LLM结合RAG方法在问答任务中表现优异

Conclusion: 基于RAG和微调LLM的问答系统能有效解决课程论坛中的问题响应挑战，具有实用价值

Abstract: The course forums are increasingly significant and play vital role in facilitating student discussions and answering their questions related to the course. It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM with RAG method has a strong performance on question answering task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TermGPT框架，通过多级对比学习解决LLM在专业术语表示上的各向同性问题，特别针对法律和金融领域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本生成方面表现优异，但其嵌入空间存在各向同性问题，导致在专业领域（如法律、金融）术语级表示能力不足，影响下游任务性能

Method: 构建句子图捕捉语义结构关系，基于上下文和拓扑线索生成对比样本，设计句子级和词元级多级对比学习方法

Result: 在金融术语数据集上实验表明，TermGPT在法律和金融领域的术语区分任务中优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: TermGPT框架有效提升了LLM在专业领域的术语表示能力，为领域特定应用提供了更好的语义区分

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in text generation tasks; however, their embedding spaces often suffer from the isotropy problem, resulting in poor discrimination of domain-specific terminology, particularly in legal and financial contexts. This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents. Experiments show that TermGPT outperforms existing baselines in term discrimination tasks within the finance and legal domains.

*Mingye Zhu,Yi Liu,Zheren Fu,Quan Wang,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InTRO是一个新框架，通过令牌级探索和自我反馈来解决LLM推理训练中的泛化问题和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法存在局限性：监督微调惩罚了同样有效的替代推理路径，而强化学习在信用分配和计算成本方面存在困难。

Method: 利用生成策略与其答案条件对应策略之间的信息差异估计令牌级重要性权重，在单次前向传播中实现令牌级探索和自我反馈。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，InTRO始终优于其他基线方法，将解决方案准确率相对基础模型提高了20%，并且推理链更加简洁。

Conclusion: InTRO不仅提高了推理准确性，还实现了跨领域迁移，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for chain-of-thought reasoning presents a significant challenge: supervised fine-tuning on a single "golden" rationale hurts generalization as it penalizes equally valid alternatives, whereas reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards struggles with credit assignment and prohibitive computational cost. To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HierRouter是一种分层路由方法，通过动态组装轻量级专用语言模型来构建推理管道，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在资源受限或实时场景中部署时面临的高计算和内存成本问题

Method: 将问题建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，使用基于PPO的强化学习代理在推理过程中动态选择模型，考虑上下文和累积成本

Result: 在6个基准测试中，相比独立使用单个模型，响应质量提升高达2.4倍，仅产生最小额外推理成本

Conclusion: 分层路由方法为实现成本高效、高性能的LLM推理提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

*Jialin Wu,Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinfeng Li,Xiaofeng Wang,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnchTable是一个新颖框架，通过NTK安全向量蒸馏和干扰感知合并技术，在微调LLM时保持安全对齐，解决安全性与实用性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM微调过程会削弱安全对齐，导致有害输出风险增加，需要在不影响性能的情况下维持安全约束。

Method: 使用NTK安全向量蒸馏方法解耦安全约束与任务推理，结合干扰感知合并技术平衡安全性和实用性。

Result: 在11个数据集和3种LLM架构上的评估显示，EnchTable显著降低不安全率，提高实用性得分，并有效抵抗jailbreaking攻击。

Conclusion: EnchTable能无缝集成到各种部署流程中，在不同任务领域具有通用适用性，且不产生显著开销。

Abstract: Many machine learning models are fine-tuned from large language models (LLMs) to achieve high performance in specialized domains like code generation, biomedical analysis, and mathematical problem solving. However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.

Abstract: To provide a unified and flexible solution for daily communication among hearing-impaired individuals, we introduce the Omni-Model paradigm into assistive technology and present HI-TransPA, an instruction-driven audio-visual personal assistant. The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion. Experiments on our purpose-built HI-Dialogue dataset show that HI-TransPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both literal accuracy and semantic fidelity. This work establishes a foundation for applying Omni-Models to assistive communication technology, providing an end-to-end modeling framework and essential processing tools for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范是主观的、语境依赖的，且因文化而异，现有方法主要针对孤立话语或合成对话，难以捕捉真实对话的流动性。

Method: 提出Norm-RAG框架，建模话语级属性（沟通意图、说话者角色、人际框架、语言线索），通过语义分块检索结构化规范文档，实现可解释的规范推理。

Result: 在MINDS双语数据集上实验表明，Norm-RAG提高了规范检测和泛化能力，在文化适应性和社交智能对话系统方面表现更好。

Conclusion: Norm-RAG为多语言对话中的社会规范推理提供了有效的解决方案，有助于开发更具文化适应性的社交智能系统。

Abstract: Social norms are implicit, culturally grounded expectations that guide interpersonal communication. Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression. Our experiments show that Norm-RAG improves norm detection and generalization, demonstrates improved performance for culturally adaptive and socially intelligent dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 本研究通过使用GPT-4o-mini对646个选择题进行自动化知识组件识别，发现单纯LLM方法效果不如专家设计，且产生过多冗余标签。通过基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法显著改善了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识组件的手动识别是自适应学习系统的瓶颈，现有LLM方法在小数据集上效果有限且产生冗余标签，需要解决规模化应用和冗余问题。

Method: 首先使用GPT-4o-mini的"模拟教科书"提示策略对646个选择题进行知识组件识别，然后提出基于余弦相似度的语义合并方法来减少冗余标签。

Result: 单纯LLM方法产生569个知识组件，RMSE为0.4285，不如专家设计的101个组件（RMSE 0.4206）。使用余弦相似度阈值0.8的合并方法将组件数减少到428个，RMSE改善到0.4259。

Conclusion: 单纯的规模化LLM生成不足够，但结合语义合并技术为自动化知识组件识别提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Knowledge Components (KCs) are foundational to adaptive learning systems, but their manual identification by domain experts is a significant bottleneck. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a "simulated textbook" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.

TL;DR: REAP方法通过子任务规划器和事实提取器模块，在检索增强生成中实现全局规划和细粒度分析，解决多跳推理中的局部推理困境和潜在线索利用不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在多跳推理任务中缺乏全局规划，容易陷入局部推理困境，且对检索内容的利用不足，忽视潜在线索，影响推理结果的准确性。

Method: 提出REAP框架，包含子任务规划器(SP)和事实提取器(FE)模块。SP维护全局视角，指导推理方向并评估任务状态；FE对检索内容进行细粒度分析提取可靠答案和线索。两个模块协同工作，增量构建逻辑一致的全局知识表示。

Result: 在多个公开多跳数据集上的实验表明，REAP在域内和域外设置下均显著优于现有RAG方法，验证了其在复杂多跳推理任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: REAP通过结构化子任务和事实维护，结合统一任务范式设计，显著提升了多跳推理的可靠性和可追溯性，为复杂推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been extensively employed to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple public multi-hop datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RAG methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, validating its effectiveness in complex multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但在数值推理方面存在明显不足，需要系统评估其在数值事实核查中的稳健性

Method: 使用受控扰动（包括标签翻转探针）对最先进模型进行系统评估，测试其在数值声明和证据对上的真实性预测能力

Result: 所有模型在特定扰动下准确率显著下降（最高62%），增加上下文长度通常降低准确率，但使用扰动演示增强扩展上下文后大多数模型能大幅恢复

Conclusion: 数值事实核查存在关键局限性，当前语言模型的稳健性仍是一个开放挑战

Abstract: Large language models show strong performance on knowledge intensive tasks such as fact-checking and question answering, yet they often struggle with numerical reasoning. We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover. These findings highlight critical limitations in numerical fact-checking and suggest that robustness remains an open challenge for current language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出ETC方法，通过建模token级不确定性动态来确定最佳检索时机，在六个QA基准测试中优于基线方法并减少检索频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态RAG允许LLM按需获取外部知识，但现有方法基于低token置信度触发检索，可能导致错误传播后才干预。需要更早检测不确定性趋势。

Method: ETC利用熵序列的一阶和二阶差分来检测新兴不确定性趋势，实现更早更精确的检索触发，无需训练且模型无关。

Result: 在六个QA基准测试和三个LLM骨干上的实验表明，ETC始终优于强基线，减少检索频率，在领域特定场景中特别有效。

Conclusion: 趋势感知的不确定性建模能产生更有效的检索时机，ETC方法即插即用，可轻松集成到现有解码流程中。

Abstract: Dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows large language models (LLMs) to fetch external knowledge on demand, offering greater adaptability than static RAG. A central challenge in this setting lies in determining the optimal timing for retrieval. Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines. Implementation code is included in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言RAG中，当检索到的证据与用户查询和上下文示例语言不一致时，模型经常出现语言漂移，在推理密集型解码（如思维链生成）中尤为明显。

Method: 提出Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD)方法，这是一种轻量级、无需训练的解码策略，通过惩罚非目标语言标记来引导生成朝向目标语言。

Result: 在三个多语言数据集和多种类型不同语言上的实验表明，SCD能够持续改善语言对齐和任务性能。

Conclusion: SCD为多语言RAG提供了一种有效且可推广的解决方案，无需修改架构或额外数据。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform knowledge-intensive tasks in multilingual settings by leveraging retrieved documents as external evidence. However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.
  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERTScore作为广泛采用的语义相似度评估指标，在金融领域存在严重缺陷——对数值变化不敏感，而金融文本中数值精度直接影响语义（如区分2%收益和20%损失）。

Method: 构建FinNuE诊断数据集，通过受控的数值扰动覆盖财报电话会议、监管文件、社交媒体和新闻文章等多种金融文本类型。

Result: BERTScore无法区分语义关键的数值差异，经常为财务上截然不同的文本对分配高相似度分数。

Conclusion: 嵌入式评估指标在金融领域存在根本性局限，需要开发数值感知的金融NLP评估框架。

Abstract: BERTScore has become a widely adopted metric for evaluating semantic similarity between natural language sentences. However, we identify a critical limitation: BERTScore exhibits low sensitivity to numerical variation, a significant weakness in finance where numerical precision directly affects meaning (e.g., distinguishing a 2% gain from a 20% loss). We introduce FinNuE, a diagnostic dataset constructed with controlled numerical perturbations across earnings calls, regulatory filings, social media, and news articles. Using FinNuE, demonstrate that BERTScore fails to distinguish semantically critical numerical differences, often assigning high similarity scores to financially divergent text pairs. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations of embedding-based metrics for finance and motivate numerically-aware evaluation frameworks for financial NLP.

Conclusion: 分析了当前LLMs在正式教育系统中的优势和局限性，为AI教育工具开发提供参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework "PustakAI"\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset "NCERT-QA" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8. We classify the curated QA pairs as Factoid, Inferential, and Others (evaluative and reasoning). We evaluate the dataset with various prompting techniques, such as meta-prompt, few-shot, and CoT-style prompting, using diverse evaluation metrics to understand which approach aligns more efficiently with the structure and demands of the curriculum. Along with the usability of the dataset, we analyze the strengths and limitations of current open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1b, Llama3.2:3b, and Nemotron-mini:4b) and high-end LLMs (Llama-4-Scout-17B and Deepseek-r1-70B) as AI-based learning tools in formal education systems.

Motivation: 标准自注意力的二次复杂度限制了Transformer模型在长上下文任务中的应用，而现有高效变体需要架构更改和昂贵的从头预训练。

Method: 将长输入分割为重叠块，使用参数自由的融合机制，通过累积前后块的上下文向量来丰富每个块的边界表示，赋予结构位置感知。

Conclusion: ScaleFormer提供了一种简单有效的方法，使预训练模型能够有效推理长文本，实现线性复杂度并保持文档叙事流的结构感知。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention severely limits the application of Transformer-based models to long-context tasks. While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text. Experiments on long-document summarization show that our method is highly competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring architectural modifications or external retrieval mechanisms.

Method: 使用LEX-ICON数据集（包含4种语言的8052个真实词和2930个伪词），通过测量音素级注意力分数来分析模型在25个语义维度上的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究首次大规模量化分析了MLLMs对语音象征性的可解释性，为人工智能与认知语言学领域搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖大规模多轮对话数据集微调LLMs，将每次响应生成视为孤立任务，未能显式优化多轮指令跟随，导致LLMs难以处理复杂的长距离约束。

Method: GraphIF包含三个核心组件：基于智能体的关系提取模块构建结构化图、关系图提示生成模块将图信息转换为自然语言提示、响应重写模块利用图提示优化LLM输出。

Result: 在两个长多轮对话数据集上的实验表明，GraphIF可无缝集成到指令微调LLMs中，在所有四个多轮指令跟随评估指标上均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: GraphIF成功证明了图结构在增强LLMs多轮指令跟随能力方面的有效性，为构建更智能的对话系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-turn instruction following is essential for building intelligent conversational systems that can consistently adhere to instructions across dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We present ADI-20, an extension of the previously published ADI-17 Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) dataset. ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer. We investigated the effect of (i) training data size and (ii) the model's number of parameters on identification performance. Our results show a small decrease in F1 score while using only 30% of the original training data. We open-source our collected data and trained models to enable the reproduction of our work, as well as support further research in ADI.

Abstract: With the growing number of submitted scientific papers, there is an increasing demand for systems that can assist reviewers in evaluating research claims. Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已成为灾害事件监测的重要工具，但现有系统存在事件相关偏置问题，影响对新兴事件的泛化能力

Method: 通过因果视角减少事件和领域相关偏置，提出偏置缓解方法

Result: 在三个灾害分类任务中优于多个基线方法，F1分数提升高达+1.9%，显著改善了基于PLM的分类器性能

Conclusion: 基于因果学习的偏置缓解方法能有效提升灾害事件分类系统的泛化能力

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of social media platforms, these tools have become essential for monitoring information during ongoing disaster events. However, extracting valuable insights requires real-time processing of vast amounts of data. A major challenge in existing systems is their exposure to event-related biases, which negatively affects their ability to generalize to emerging events. While recent advancements in debiasing and causal learning offer promising solutions, they remain underexplored in the disaster event domain. In this work, we approach bias mitigation through a causal lens and propose a method to reduce event- and domain-related biases, enhancing generalization to future events. Our approach outperforms multiple baselines by up to +1.9% F1 and significantly improves a PLM-based classifier across three disaster classification tasks.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个基于Web的可视化交互系统，用于分析多轮推理任务中大型语言模型的推理过程，通过可视化上下文影响和交互式修改对话历史来降低分析复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮交互中的推理过程分析面临复杂上下文依赖和缺乏专门可视化工具的挑战，导致研究人员认知负荷高。

Method: 开发VISTA系统，提供上下文影响可视化、交互式对话历史修改、自动生成推理依赖树等功能。

Result: VISTA显著降低了分析推理链的复杂性，促进了对LLM能力和局限性的深入理解。

Conclusion: VISTA为多轮推理任务提供了一个统一交互框架，支持自定义基准和本地模型集成，有助于提升LLM推理过程的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn interactions, as these scenarios more closely mirror real-world problem-solving. However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct "what-if" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path. By providing a unified and interactive framework, VISTA significantly reduces the complexity of analyzing reasoning chains, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current LLMs. The platform is open-source and supports easy integration of custom benchmarks and local models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Text2SQL-Flow框架，通过数据增强生成大规模、语义有效且结构多样的Text-to-SQL对，构建了包含89,544个标注示例的SQLFlow数据集，并在开源和闭源LLM上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL领域受限于数据稀缺、简单和低多样性，限制了模型性能，需要高质量、大规模的数据集来推动发展。

Method: 开发了SQL感知的数据增强框架，包含六个增强维度，集成了SQL执行验证、自然语言问题生成、思维链推理轨迹和数据分类的端到端流程，使用模块化数据库管理器确保跨数据库兼容性。

Result: 构建了SQLFlow高质量数据集；在开源LLM上微调持续提升性能；在闭源LLM上引入掩码对齐检索方法，通过建模问题与SQL查询的细粒度对齐实现结构感知的示例匹配，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了可扩展的数据中心化基础，推进Text-to-SQL系统发展，并强调了高质量结构化数据在现代AI中的关键作用。

Abstract: The data-centric paradigm has become pivotal in AI, especially for Text-to-SQL, where performance is limited by scarce, simplistic, and low-diversity datasets. To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever. This enables structure-aware example matching by modeling fine-grained alignments between questions and SQL queries. Experiments show our retrieval strategy outperforms existing methods, underscoring the value of SQLFlow's high-fidelity data and our novel technique. Our work establishes a scalable, data-centric foundation for advancing Text-to-SQL systems and highlights the critical role of high-quality structured data in modern AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiReason-Bench是一个统一基准，用于评估高效推理方法，包括推理蓝图、动态执行和后处理优化三类方法。通过构建标准化推理注释和提出E3-Score指标，在数学、常识和逻辑任务上评估了7种方法和6个LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的CoT推理往往产生冗长解释，增加成本且可能降低准确性。不同高效推理方法的评估实践碎片化，缺乏统一比较标准。

Method: 构建EffiReason-Bench基准，包含CommonsenseQA和LogiQA的验证CoT注释，采用标准化推理结构、选项分析和人工验证。提出E3-Score指标，基于经济权衡建模进行平滑稳定评估。

Result: 评估了7种方法在6个开源LLM（1B-70B）上的表现，涵盖4个数据集。实验表明没有单一方法在所有情况下最优，最佳策略取决于模型规模、任务复杂度和架构。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的选择需要综合考虑模型规模、任务特性和架构因素，没有通用最优解。EffiReason-Bench为跨范式评估提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting achieve strong reasoning but often produce unnecessarily long explanations, increasing cost and sometimes reducing accuracy. Fair comparison of efficiency-oriented approaches is hindered by fragmented evaluation practices. We introduce EffiReason-Bench, a unified benchmark for rigorous cross-paradigm evaluation of efficient reasoning methods across three categories: Reasoning Blueprints, Dynamic Execution, and Post-hoc Refinement. To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.

TL;DR: 提出PAL框架，将人设对齐作为对话生成的训练目标，通过两阶段训练和选择后生成策略，提升人设相关性和语义层面的响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流模型依赖词级语言模型训练，容易忽视给定人设信息，生成通用回复，需要直接以人设对齐为目标。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：人设感知学习和人设对齐，配合选择后生成推理策略，在语义层面提升人设敏感性。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于现有先进个性化对话方法和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: PAL框架能有效提升个性化对话生成的人设相关性和一致性。

Abstract: Personalized dialogue generation aims to leverage persona profiles and dialogue history to generate persona-relevant and consistent responses. Mainstream models typically rely on token-level language model training with persona dialogue data, such as Next Token Prediction, to implicitly achieve personalization, making these methods tend to neglect the given personas and generate generic responses. To address this issue, we propose a novel Persona-Aware Alignment Framework (PAL), which directly treats persona alignment as the training objective of dialogue generation. Specifically, PAL employs a two-stage training method including Persona-aware Learning and Persona Alignment, equipped with an easy-to-use inference strategy Select then Generate, to improve persona sensitivity and generate more persona-relevant responses at the semantics level. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms many state-of-the-art personalized dialogue methods and large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangGPS是一个基于语言可分性的轻量级两阶段预选择框架，通过量化不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分度来优化多语言训练数据选择，提升现有选择方法的有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言训练数据选择方法通常忽略数据的固有语言结构，导致多语言能力对训练数据组成高度敏感。

Method: 提出LangGPS框架：首先基于语言可分性分数过滤训练数据，然后使用现有选择方法精炼子集。语言可分性量化了不同语言样本在模型表示空间中的可区分程度。

Result: 在6个基准测试和22种语言上的实验表明，LangGPS能显著提升现有选择方法的有效性，特别是在理解任务和低资源语言上。高可分性样本促进清晰语言边界的形成，低可分性样本则作为跨语言对齐的桥梁。

Conclusion: 语言可分性为多语言环境中的数据效用提供了新视角，支持开发更具语言意识的LLMs，并可作为多语言课程学习的有效信号。

Abstract: Joint multilingual instruction tuning is a widely adopted approach to improve the multilingual instruction-following ability and downstream performance of large language models (LLMs), but the resulting multilingual capability remains highly sensitive to the composition and selection of the training data. Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端语音语言模型存在显著的响应延迟问题，主要源于自回归生成语音令牌和依赖复杂的流匹配模型进行语音合成。

Method: 引入VocalNet-M2模型，整合多码本分词器和多令牌预测策略，直接生成多码本语音令牌，无需延迟诱导的流匹配模型。

Result: 实验表明，VocalNet-M2显著降低了首块延迟（从约725ms到350ms），同时在主流语音语言模型中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发实时交互应用的高效高性能语音语言模型提供了有价值的见解，并全面比较了单码本和多码本策略。

Abstract: Current end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have made notable progress, yet they still encounter considerable response latency. This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮交互和对话特征，忽略了多轮通信的复杂性以及指令遵循和安全性等关键能力。全双工语音语言模型在多轮设置中的评估面临沟通轮次边界模糊和模型推理中上下文不一致等挑战。

Method: 将连续的全双工对话分割为离散的轮次，实现轮次级的全面评估。构建包含对话质量、对话动态、指令遵循和安全性四个维度的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前的全双工语音语言模型在保持多轮和多个评估维度的一致性能方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试对于评估和改进全双工语音语言模型在多轮对话中的表现是必要且有效的。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Conclusion: 隐私和性能在企业AI部署中不必相互排斥，银行、医院和律师事务所可安全采用对话式文档AI

Abstract: Organizations handling sensitive documents face a critical dilemma: adopt cloud-based AI systems that offer powerful question-answering capabilities but compromise data privacy, or maintain local processing that ensures security but delivers poor accuracy. We present a question-answering system that resolves this trade-off by combining semantic understanding with keyword precision, operating entirely on local infrastructure without internet access. Our approach demonstrates that organizations can achieve competitive accuracy on complex queries across legal, scientific, and conversational documents while keeping all data on their machines. By balancing two complementary retrieval strategies and using consumer-grade hardware acceleration, the system delivers reliable answers with minimal errors, letting banks, hospitals, and law firms adopt conversational document AI without transmitting proprietary information to external providers. This work establishes that privacy and performance need not be mutually exclusive in enterprise AI deployment.

Conclusion: 通过识别并纠正大语言模型基于困惑度的评估偏好，可以显著提升其在多步数学推理中的批判能力。

Abstract: To improve Multi-step Mathematical Reasoning (MsMR) of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is crucial to obtain scalable supervision from the corpus by automatically critiquing mistakes in the reasoning process of MsMR and rendering a final verdict of the problem-solution. Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct. Extensive experimental results on our built OPS and existing available critic benchmarks demonstrate the validity of our method.

Abstract: In the context of pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data has emerged as an alternative for generating high-quality pretraining data at scale. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models. Our framework enables robust quality control across diverse scripts and linguistic contexts. Empirical results through model runs reveal key trade-offs in generation strategies and highlight best practices for constructing effective multilingual corpora.

Motivation: 文化遗产文本包含丰富知识，但由于难以将非结构化论述系统转换为结构化知识图谱，导致难以系统查询。

Method: 五步方法论：基础分析、注释模式开发、管道架构、集成优化和全面评估。使用三个LLM（Claude Sonnet 3.7、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-4o-mini）构建顺序管道。

Result: 成功提取复杂文化遗产知识：元数据提取F1 0.96-0.99，实体识别F1 0.7-0.8，假设提取F1 0.65-0.75，证据提取F1 0.95-0.97，论述表示G-EVAL 0.62。较小模型表现具竞争力。

Conclusion: ATR4CH为协调LLM提取与文化遗产本体论提供了首个系统性方法，提供可复现框架，支持文化遗产机构将文本知识转换为可查询知识图谱。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage texts contain rich knowledge that is difficult to query systematically due to the challenges of converting unstructured discourse into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval-based methods with generative models. As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.

### [44] [Position: On the Methodological Pitfalls of Evaluating Base LLMs for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10381)
*Jason Chan,Zhixue Zhao,Robert Gaizauskas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑现有研究中评估基础LLM推理能力的方法论问题，指出基础LLM的预训练目标与推理评估的规范性质量存在根本性不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估基础LLM的推理能力时忽略了方法论上的根本问题，作者认为需要重新审视这些假设。

Method: 通过分析基础LLM预训练目标与推理评估标准之间的不匹配，展示基础LLM生成逻辑结论只是语言统计模式的副产品。

Result: 发现基础LLM的输出不能被视为其真实推理尝试，且关于基础LLM推理的结论不能推广到经过指令优化的后训练LLM。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新审视依赖这些假设的现有研究，未来工作应考虑这些方法论陷阱。

Abstract: Existing work investigates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to uncover their limitations, human-like biases and underlying processes. Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following. We call for a critical re-examination of existing work that relies implicitly on these assumptions, and for future work to account for these methodological pitfalls.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELICATE是一种用于历史意大利语实体链接的神经符号方法，结合BERT编码器和Wikidata上下文信息，通过时间合理性和实体类型一致性选择知识库实体。ENEIDE是一个历史意大利语多领域实体链接语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人文学科中实体链接面临的挑战：复杂文档类型、缺乏领域特定数据集和模型、长尾实体问题。

Method: DELICATE方法：BERT编码器+Wikidata上下文信息，使用时间合理性和实体类型一致性来选择知识库实体。ENEIDE语料库：从19-20世纪文学和政治文本中半自动提取的多领域历史意大利语实体链接语料库。

Result: DELICATE在历史意大利语实体链接任务中优于其他模型，即使与具有数十亿参数的大型架构相比。DELICATE的置信度分数和特征敏感性提供了比纯神经方法更可解释和可理解的结果。

Conclusion: DELICATE方法在人文学科实体链接任务中表现出色，特别是在处理历史意大利语时，其神经符号方法提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: In spite of the remarkable advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing, the task of Entity Linking (EL) remains challenging in the field of humanities due to complex document typologies, lack of domain-specific datasets and models, and long-tail entities, i.e., entities under-represented in Knowledge Bases (KBs). The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters. Moreover, further analyses reveal how DELICATE confidence scores and features sensitivity provide results which are more explainable and interpretable than purely neural methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类比范式组织的计算方法，通过少量结构化数据训练轻量级模型，在英语使动/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，超越GPT-3的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否通过类比范式组织，能让轻量级模型在少量数据下达到与大型语言模型相当的性能，解决数据效率问题。

Method: 采用三种认知启发原则：类比结构、对比学习和最小上下文线索，在结构化完形填空任务中训练BERT+CNN轻量模型。

Result: 仅用100个结构化示例训练，在英语使动/起始交替任务上达到F1=0.95，显著优于GPT-3零样本性能（F1=0.87），消融研究证实类比组织和对比结构的有效性。

Conclusion: 类比范式组织能够以比传统方法少几个数量级的数据实现有竞争力的语言规则学习，展示了数据效率的巨大提升。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance through training on vast datasets. Can analogical paradigm organization enable lightweight models to match this performance with minimal data? We develop a computational approach implementing three cognitive-inspired principles: analogical structure, contrastive learning, and minimal contextual cues. We test this approach with structured completion tasks where models identify correct sentence completions from analogical patterns with contrastive alternatives. Training lightweight models (BERT+CNN, $0.5M$ parameters) on only one hundred structured examples of English causative/inchoative alternations achieves $F1=0.95$, outperforming zero-shot \texttt{GPT-o3} ($F1=0.87$). Ablation studies confirm that analogical organization and contrastive structure improve performance, consistently surpassing randomly shuffled baselines across architectures. Cross-phenomenon validation using unspecified object alternations replicates these efficiency gains, confirming approach robustness. Our results show that analogical paradigm organization enables competitive linguistic rule learning with orders of magnitude less data than conventional approaches require.

TL;DR: 提出一种生成多解释-答案对的方法来处理语言模型对模糊请求的误解问题，通过强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，在对话问答和语义解析任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理模糊请求时通常会隐式地承诺一种解释，这种意图误解会使用户感到沮丧并带来安全风险。

Method: 使用强化学习和定制奖励函数训练模型，以多个有效答案作为监督，在单一结构化响应中生成多个解释-答案对。

Result: 在对话问答和语义解析任务上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法实现了更高的有效答案覆盖率。人工评估确认预测的解释与其答案高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式解释提高透明度，仅需一个生成步骤实现效率，并通过结构化输出格式支持下游应用。

Abstract: Large language models often respond to ambiguous requests by implicitly committing to one interpretation. Intent misunderstandings can frustrate users and create safety risks. To address this, we propose generating multiple interpretation-answer pairs in a single structured response to ambiguous requests. Our models are trained with reinforcement learning and customized reward functions using multiple valid answers as supervision. Experiments on conversational question answering and semantic parsing demonstrate that our method achieves higher coverage of valid answers than baseline approaches. Human evaluation confirms that predicted interpretations are highly aligned with their answers. Our approach promotes transparency with explicit interpretations, achieves efficiency by requiring only one generation step, and supports downstream applications through its structured output format.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在状态跟踪任务中的能力，将状态跟踪组件与其他因素隔离，分析不同场景下LLMs的表现。

Method: 提出基于三个明确定义的状态跟踪任务的基准测试，分析LLMs在不同场景下的性能，包括使用思维链等机制。

Result: 新一代LLMs（GPT-4、Llama3）能够有效跟踪状态，特别是结合思维链时；前代模型在初始阶段能理解任务但后续容易失败。

Conclusion: 近期LLMs在状态跟踪方面表现出色，但模型代际差异显著，机制集成对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in solving complex tasks, including those requiring a certain level of reasoning. In this paper, we focus on state tracking, a problem where models need to keep track of the state governing a number of entities. To isolate the state tracking component from other factors, we propose a benchmark based on three well-defined state tracking tasks and analyse the performance of LLMs in different scenarios. The results indicate that the recent generation of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4 and Llama3) are capable of tracking state, especially when integrated with mechanisms such as Chain of Thought. However, models from the former generation, while understanding the task and being able to solve it at the initial stages, often fail at this task after a certain number of steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LocalBench是首个系统评估LLMs在美国县级本地知识能力的基准，包含14,782个验证问题，涵盖526个县。评估显示现有模型在本地知识方面存在严重局限，最佳模型准确率仅56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估主要关注宏观地理任务，而现实应用需要AI系统能够理解社区特定的动态、文化叙事和本地治理，但缺乏针对超本地知识的系统评估。

Method: 基于Localness概念框架构建LocalBench基准，整合人口普查数据、本地subreddit讨论和区域新闻，涵盖物理、认知和关系三个维度，评估13个最先进LLMs在闭卷和网络增强设置下的表现。

Result: 模型表现严重不足：最佳模型在叙事式问题上准确率仅56.8%，数值推理低于15.5%。更大模型规模和网络增强不保证更好性能，搜索对Gemini提升13.6%但对GPT系列降低11.4%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够支持公平、位置感知AI系统的语言模型，能够参与不同地理和文化背景下本地社区的多样化、细粒度现实。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on macro-scale geographic tasks, such as global factual recall, event summarization, and regional reasoning. Yet, their ability to handle hyper-local knowledge remains poorly understood. This gap is increasingly consequential as real-world applications, from civic platforms to community journalism, demand AI systems that can reason about neighborhood-specific dynamics, cultural narratives, and local governance. Existing benchmarks fall short in capturing this complexity, often relying on coarse-grained data or isolated references. We present LocalBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs on county-level local knowledge across the United States. Grounded in the Localness Conceptual Framework, LocalBench includes 14,782 validated question-answer pairs across 526 U.S. counties in 49 states, integrating diverse sources such as Census statistics, local subreddit discourse, and regional news. It spans physical, cognitive, and relational dimensions of locality. Using LocalBench, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs under both closed-book and web-augmented settings. Our findings reveal critical limitations: even the best-performing models reach only 56.8% accuracy on narrative-style questions and perform below 15.5% on numerical reasoning. Moreover, larger model size and web augmentation do not guarantee better performance, for example, search improves Gemini's accuracy by +13.6%, but reduces GPT-series performance by -11.4%. These results underscore the urgent need for language models that can support equitable, place-aware AI systems: capable of engaging with the diverse, fine-grained realities of local communities across geographic and cultural contexts.

TL;DR: KPPO是一种基于知识供给的提示优化框架，通过系统性的知识整合而非潜在能力激发来优化提示，在知识密集型任务中显著优于基于激发的传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注激发模型能力，但在知识密集型任务中存在根本性局限，无法提供特定领域所需的事实知识、术语精确性和推理模式。

Method: 提出KPPO框架，包含三个关键创新：知识差距填补机制、批量候选评估方法（考虑性能提升和分布稳定性）、自适应知识剪枝策略（平衡性能和token效率）。

Result: 在15个知识密集型基准测试中，KPPO比最强基线平均性能提升约6%，同时token使用量减少高达29%，达到相当或更低的token消耗。

Conclusion: KPPO通过将提示优化重新定义为系统性知识整合，有效解决了知识密集型任务中的挑战，在性能和效率方面均优于传统激发式方法。

Abstract: While prompt optimization has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing language model performance, existing approaches primarily focus on elicitation-based strategies that search for optimal prompts to activate models' capabilities. These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Method: 开发了包含1600多个提示的AdvancedIF基准，并提出RIFL训练流程，包括评分标准生成、微调的评分验证器和奖励塑造

Result: RIFL在AdvancedIF上实现了6.7%的绝对提升，在公共基准测试中也表现出色

Conclusion: 评分标准是训练和评估大语言模型高级指令跟随能力的有效工具，为开发更强大可靠的AI系统铺平道路

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to impressive performance on a range of tasks, yet advanced instruction following (IF)-especially for complex, multi-turn, and system-prompted instructions-remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL. This work establishes rubrics as a powerful tool for both training and evaluating advanced IF in LLMs, paving the way for more capable and reliable AI systems.

In this paper, we introduce LOCA-R (LOgical Chain Augmentation for Reasoning), an improved version of the LOCA framework adapted for complex reasoning, and apply it to the CPhO 2025 theory examination. LOCA-R achieves a near-perfect score of 313 out of 320 points, solidly surpassing the highest-scoring human competitor and significantly outperforming all baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估主要关注语义等价改写，忽视了语言风格变化作为攻击面的潜在风险，需要系统研究风格重构对模型安全性的影响。

Method: 构建风格增强的越狱基准测试，将3个标准数据集的提示转化为11种语言风格，使用手工模板和LLM重写保持语义意图，评估16个开源和闭源模型，并引入风格中和预处理防御方法。

Result: 风格重构使越狱成功率最高提升57个百分点，恐惧、好奇和同情等风格最有效，情境化重写优于模板变体，风格中和预处理显著降低越狱成功率。

Conclusion: 语言风格重构是当前安全管道中被忽视的系统性和扩展抵抗性漏洞，需要新的防御机制来应对这种攻击面。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated for robustness against paraphrased or semantically equivalent jailbreak prompts, yet little attention has been paid to linguistic variation as an attack surface. In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.
  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates. Our findings reveal a systemic and scaling-resistant vulnerability overlooked in current safety pipelines.

Motivation: 现有对话记忆评估基准在统计能力、数据生成一致性和评估灵活性方面存在局限性，需要更全面的评估框架来推动对话记忆研究的发展。

Method: 构建大规模对话记忆评估基准，比较全上下文方法与RAG系统在不同对话长度下的性能，分析对话记忆与RAG系统的异同点。

Result: 简单全上下文方法在150次对话内达到70-82%准确率，而复杂RAG系统仅30-45%。研究发现前30次对话全上下文方法最优，150次内仍可行，超过150次需要混合或RAG方法。

Conclusion: 对话记忆具有小语料库优势，需要专门研究而非简单应用通用RAG解决方案，因为从零开始逐步增长的特性使其与RAG系统有本质区别。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for conversational memory evaluation containing 75,336 question-answer pairs across diverse categories including user facts, assistant recall, abstention, preferences, temporal changes, and implicit connections. While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.

Motivation: 探讨文学体裁作为形式分类与制度分类的合理性，理解形式与内容在文学分类中的重要性。

Method: 使用CONLIT数据集构建文学小说和体裁小说语料库，采用Welch's ANOVA比较叙事特征分布，使用逻辑回归建模特征对文学分类的影响，分析风格和语义向量表示。

Result: 发现每个文学类别具有统计显著的形式标记，女性作者身份会缩小和模糊获得文学地位的标准。

Conclusion: 文学体裁具有可识别和可量化的形式特征，但作者性别在文学分类中起着重要的调节作用。

Abstract: Though the concept of genre has been a subject of discussion for millennia, the relatively recent emergence of genre fiction has added a new layer to this ongoing conversation. While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification. This project finds statistically significant formal markers of each literary category and illustrates how female authorship narrows and blurs the target for achieving literary status.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在长文档理解中的两个核心挑战：大量无关内容的信息干扰，以及Transformer架构的二次计算成本。现有方法要么牺牲细节精度，要么增加系统复杂度。

Method: 提出URaG框架，引入轻量级跨模态检索模块，将早期Transformer层转换为高效的证据选择器，识别并保留最相关页面，让深层层专注于相关信息。

Result: 在广泛实验中，URaG实现了最先进的性能，同时将计算开销降低了44-56%。

Conclusion: URaG证明了可以利用MLLMs固有的证据定位能力在推理过程中执行检索，为高效的长文档理解提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with long document understanding due to two fundamental challenges: information interference from abundant irrelevant content, and the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based architectures. Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%. The code is available at https://github.com/shi-yx/URaG.

Motivation: 当前ASTE任务在准确捕捉方面、观点和情感极性之间关系方面仍面临挑战，先进语言模型在理解复杂语言模式方面的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 集成DeBERTa的增强注意力机制与LSTM通道，构建双通道结构，分别处理文本语义和语法模式，并精心优化组件间的协作方式。

Result: 在标准数据集上，DESS在识别方面观点对和准确确定情感方面比现有方法有显著改进，F1分数分别提高了4.85、8.36和2.42。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当经过深思熟虑地集成时，升级到更先进的语言模型可以真正提高文本情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis faces ongoing challenges in Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), particularly in accurately capturing the relationships between aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at: https://github.com/VishalRepos/DESS.

TL;DR: 本文评估了MedGemma模型在医疗订单提取任务中的表现，比较了三种提示方法：单样本提示、ReAct框架和代理工作流，发现简单的单样本方法在验证集上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确提取医患对话中的医疗订单对于减轻临床文档负担和确保患者安全至关重要。本文旨在探索领域特定的开源语言模型MedGemma在结构化订单提取任务中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种不同的提示范式：直接的单样本方法、基于推理的ReAct框架和多步骤代理工作流，使用MEDIQA-OE-2025共享任务的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，虽然ReAct和代理工作流等复杂框架功能强大，但简单的单样本提示方法在官方验证集上取得了最高性能。

Conclusion: 在手动标注的转录本上，复杂的推理链可能导致"过度思考"并引入噪声，使直接方法更加稳健和高效。这项工作为在不同数据条件下选择适当的临床信息提取提示策略提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The accurate extraction of medical orders from doctor-patient conversations is a critical task for reducing clinical documentation burdens and ensuring patient safety. This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to "overthinking" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient. Our work provides valuable insights into selecting appropriate prompting strategies for clinical information extraction in varied data conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种互补方法来生成伤口护理查询的文本回复：基于挖掘提示的策略和基于元数据引导的生成方法，旨在提高AI系统在异步远程护理中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步远程护理的快速发展增加了医护人员的工作负担，需要AI系统来更有效地管理患者查询，特别是在结合图像和文本的伤口护理场景中。

Method: 1. 挖掘提示策略：嵌入训练数据并检索最相似的示例作为少样本演示；2. 元数据引导生成：识别四个关键元数据属性，训练分类器预测这些属性并动态调整生成过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，挖掘提示提高了回复的相关性，而元数据引导生成进一步提升了临床精确度。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为开发能够提供可靠高效伤口护理支持的AI驱动工具指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of asynchronous remote care has intensified provider workload, creating demand for AI systems that can assist clinicians in managing patient queries more efficiently. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.

*Benjamin L. Badger,Matthew Neligeorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出编码器增强的因果解码器模型架构，通过估计语言熵来优化训练，在有限硬件上实现更高压缩率和更好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果语言模型难以准确估计语言熵，且计算成本高昂。需要更高效的架构来逼近语言熵极限，从而提升模型泛化性能。

Method: 引入编码器增强的因果解码器架构，在每token基础上估计熵，训练模型接近但不超越估计的每token熵值。

Result: 新架构在有限硬件上实现比因果transformer更高的压缩率，且接近熵极限的模型展现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过熵感知训练方法，模型在接近语言熵极限时能获得更好的泛化性能，这为高效语言模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Socratic Self-Refine (SSR)框架，通过细粒度评估和精确精炼来提升LLM推理能力，将模型响应分解为可验证的子问题-子答案对，实现步骤级置信度估计和迭代精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时框架依赖粗粒度的自我验证和自我修正，在复杂任务上效果有限，需要更精细的方法来评估和改进LLM的推理过程。

Method: SSR将模型响应分解为可验证的(子问题,子答案)对，通过控制性重解和自我一致性检查进行步骤级置信度估计，精确定位不可靠步骤并进行迭代精炼。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试和三个LLM上的实证结果显示，SSR始终优于最先进的迭代自我精炼基线方法。

Conclusion: SSR不仅提升了性能，还为评估和理解LLM内部推理过程提供了原则性的黑盒方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.

TL;DR: Instella是一个完全开源的30亿参数语言模型家族，在AMD MI300X GPU上训练，使用公开数据，在完全开源模型中达到最先进水平，并发布了支持128K上下文和数学推理的专门变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高性能语言模型大多为闭源或部分开源，限制了透明度和可复现性，需要开发完全开源的替代方案。

Method: 通过大规模预训练、通用指令微调和人类偏好对齐进行开发，使用公开可用数据和代码库，并针对长上下文和数学推理任务开发专门变体。

Result: 尽管使用比同类模型更少的预训练token，Instella在完全开源模型中达到最先进水平，并与同规模领先开源权重模型竞争。

Conclusion: Instella为社区提供了透明、高性能且多功能的替代方案，推动了开放和可复现语言建模研究的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet the majority of high-performing models remain closed-source or partially open, limiting transparency and reproducibility. In this work, we introduce Instella, a family of fully open three billion parameter language models trained entirely on openly available data and codebase. Powered by AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs, Instella is developed through large-scale pre-training, general-purpose instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出生成对抗蒸馏（GAD）方法，通过将学生LLM作为生成器、训练判别器区分师生模型响应，实现无需教师模型内部信息的黑盒蒸馏，在自动评估中达到与教师模型GPT-5-Chat相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒蒸馏中无法访问教师模型内部logits或参数的问题，实现仅基于文本输出的有效知识迁移。

Method: 将学生LLM作为生成器，训练判别器区分师生模型响应，形成极小极大博弈框架，判别器作为在线奖励模型与学生模型协同进化。

Result: GAD在实验中持续超越常用的序列级知识蒸馏方法，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct学生模型在LMSYS-Chat自动评估中达到与教师模型GPT-5-Chat相当的水平。

Conclusion: GAD被确立为黑盒LLM蒸馏的有效范式，为仅基于文本输出的知识迁移提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.

*Yesheng Liang,Haisheng Chen,Song Han,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParoQuant是一种仅权重的后训练量化方法，通过成对旋转量化和通道级缩放来抑制异常值，减少量化误差，在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销低于10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型权重和激活中的异常值会导致较大的量化误差和严重的精度下降，特别是在推理任务中误差会在长思维链中累积。现有PTQ方法要么无法充分抑制异常值，要么在推理时引入显著开销。

Method: 结合硬件高效的独立Givens旋转与通道级缩放，平衡通道间幅度并缩小每个量化组内的动态范围，同时协同设计推理内核以充分利用GPU并行性，保持旋转和缩放操作在运行时轻量。

Result: 在推理任务上比AWQ平均提升2.4%准确率，且开销低于10%。

Conclusion: 为推理大语言模型更高效和准确的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.

### [65] [FedeCouple: Fine-Grained Balancing of Global-Generalization and Local-Adaptability in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09599)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedeCouple是一种联邦学习方法，通过细粒度平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，联合学习全局和局部特征表示，使用动态知识蒸馏增强个性化分类器的泛化能力，并通过锚点优化特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法主要关注特征空间一致性和分类个性化，但忽略了提取器的局部适应性和分类器的全局泛化性，导致组件间协调不足、耦合弱，影响整体模型性能。

Method: 联合学习全局和局部特征表示；采用动态知识蒸馏增强分类器泛化；引入锚点优化特征空间（锚点具有严格局部性和非传输性，保护隐私并减少通信开销）。

Result: 在五个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedeCouple在有效性、稳定性、可扩展性和安全性方面持续优于九种基线方法。在有效性实验中，FedeCouple比最佳基线方法显著高出4.3%。

Conclusion: FedeCouple通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应性，解决了组件间协调不足的问题，理论分析证明其在非凸目标下收敛，实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: In privacy-preserving mobile network transmission scenarios with heterogeneous client data, personalized federated learning methods that decouple feature extractors and classifiers have demonstrated notable advantages in enhancing learning capability. However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security. Notably, in experiments evaluating effectiveness, FedeCouple surpasses the best baseline by a significant margin of 4.3%.

Conclusion: MMaDA-Parallel为思维感知图像合成建立了更鲁棒的范式，通过并行交互机制有效解决错误传播问题。

Abstract: While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

Conclusion: 该工作为声带创伤严重程度评估提供了自动化工具，能够支持大规模研究，最终改善临床理解和患者护理。

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

Conclusion: 这是首个探索和提出在指令式图像编辑模型中实现连续精细指令控制的框架，为交互式指令驱动图像操作开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing models have recently achieved impressive performance, enabling complex edits to an input image from a multi-instruction prompt. However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models. Our results pave the way for interactive, instruction-driven image manipulation with continuous and compositional control.

Abstract: This study enhances a crowd density estimation algorithm originally designed for image-based analysis by adapting it for video-based scenarios. The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events. By addressing the temporal challenges unique to video analysis, this work offers a scalable and efficient framework for real-time crowd monitoring in applications such as public safety, disaster response, and event management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPS缺失环境中的室内定位需求，特别是在紧急响应和辅助导航应用中。现有视觉方法如PALMS受限于智能手机LiDAR的短距离和室内布局的模糊性。

Method: 使用基础单目深度估计模型(Depth Pro)从RGB图像重建尺度对齐的3D点云，然后通过卷积与平面图进行几何布局匹配，输出位置和方向的后验分布。

Result: 在Structured3D和自定义校园数据集上，PALMS+在静态定位精度上优于PALMS和F3Loc，无需训练。在33条真实轨迹上的序列定位中，定位误差更低，展示了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PALMS+展示了在基础设施自由应用中的潜力，为相机自由跟踪提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Result: 在里昂灯光节2022的五个数据集上测试，碰撞率最高降低31%，平均位移误差和最终位移误差分别平均降低5%和6%，在大多数测试集上优于多个最先进模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够在不增加位移误差的情况下有效降低碰撞率，在从低到高的各种人群密度场景中均表现出色，为拥挤环境中的行人轨迹预测提供了更现实的解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic and crowded environments, realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenging task due to the complex nature of human motion and the mutual influences among individuals. Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.

Abstract: Soiling detection for automotive cameras is a crucial part of advanced driver assistance systems to make them more robust to external conditions like weather, dust, etc. In this paper, we regard the soiling detection as a semantic segmentation problem. We provide a comprehensive comparison of popular segmentation methods and show their superiority in performance while comparing them to tile-level classification approaches. Moreover, we present an extensive analysis of the Woodscape dataset showing that the original dataset contains a data-leakage and imprecise annotations. To address these problems, we create a new data subset, which, despite being much smaller, provides enough information for the segmentation method to reach comparable results in a much shorter time.

Conclusion: 医学预训练有益，但架构选择至关重要，预训练特征并非普遍有效，特别是在复杂定位任务中，监督模型仍是强有力替代方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) promise to generalize medical imaging, but their effectiveness varies. It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation and tracking are fundamental capabilities for physical AI systems such as robots. However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training. This annotation-free approach significantly reduces deployment overhead, providing a practical solution for modern applications, such as flexible manufacturing and intelligent quality control.

Conclusion: PANDA框架有效解决了现实世界数据流中的双重不平衡问题，为免示例持续学习提供了实用的增强方案。

Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Abstract: Restoring 3D scenes captured under low-light con- ditions remains a fundamental yet challenging problem. Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model. A dedicated Lumos loss is further introduced to promote photomet- ric consistency within the reconstructed 3D space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Lumos3D achieves high- fidelity low-light 3D scene restoration with accurate geometry and strong generalization to unseen cases. Furthermore, the framework naturally extends to handle over-exposure correction, highlighting its versatility for diverse lighting restoration tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view image retrieval, particularly street-to-satellite matching, is a critical task for applications such as autonomous navigation, urban planning, and localization in GPS-denied environments. However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks inject localized perturbations into images to mislead deep vision models. These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification. Experiments on ImageNet, ImageNette, and CIFAR-10 show that CertMask improves certified robust accuracy by up to +13.4\% over PatchCleanser, while maintaining clean accuracy nearly identical to the vanilla model.

Abstract: Space weather at Earth, driven by the solar activity, poses growing risks to satellites around our planet as well as to critical ground-based technological infrastructure. Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used in various fields, including augmented reality (AR) and robotics, where relighting and texture editing are crucial for realistic visualization. Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade. Furthermore, we showcase its applications in texture editing, relighting, and point-cloud registration under varying illumination. Finally, we verify the real-world applicability of IPCD-Net.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Conclusion: SAM-DAQ成功将SAM2适配于RGB-D视频显著目标检测，通过深度和时序线索的集成实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recently segment anything model (SAM) has attracted widespread concerns, and it is often treated as a vision foundation model for universal segmentation. Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: RWKV-PCSSC通过紧凑高效的设计实现了轻量级模型表示，在语义场景补全任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to generate a complete semantic scene from an incomplete input. Existing approaches often employ dense network architectures with a high parameter count, leading to increased model complexity and resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose RWKV-PCSSC, a lightweight point cloud semantic scene completion network inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a RWKV Seed Generator (RWKV-SG) module that can aggregate features from a partial point cloud to produce a coarse point cloud with coarse features. Subsequently, the point-wise feature of the point cloud is progressively restored through multiple stages of the RWKV Point Deconvolution (RWKV-PD) modules. By leveraging a compact and efficient design, our method achieves a lightweight model representation. Experimental results demonstrate that RWKV-PCSSC reduces the parameter count by 4.18$\times$ and improves memory efficiency by 1.37$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art methods PointSSC. Furthermore, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on established indoor (SSC-PC, NYUCAD-PC) and outdoor (PointSSC) scene dataset, as well as on our proposed datasets (NYUCAD-PC-V2, 3D-FRONT-PC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCC-3D提出了一种分层补偿压缩方法，通过全局结构压缩和自适应细节挖掘模块，在保持3D关键信息的同时实现约98%的压缩率，显著提升了3D视觉语言模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D-VLM直接将点云嵌入为3D tokens，计算成本高昂，主要瓶颈在于LLM部分处理所有3D tokens。需要找到在减少计算开销的同时保持关键信息完整性的方法。

Method: 提出分层补偿压缩(HCC-3D)：1) 全局结构压缩(GSC)：使用全局查询将3D tokens压缩为少量关键tokens；2) 自适应细节挖掘(ADM)：通过互补评分选择性重新压缩显著但未被充分关注的特征。

Result: 实验表明HCC-3D实现了约98%的压缩率，相比之前的3D-VLM在效率和性能上都有显著提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HCC-3D通过分层压缩策略有效解决了3D-VLM的计算瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了效率，为3D多模态推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D understanding has drawn significant attention recently, leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable multi-modal reasoning between point cloud and text data. Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于航拍图像中小目标检测的尺度感知中继层(SARL)和尺度自适应损失(SAL)，通过增强特征共享和重新设计损失函数来解决小目标检测难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代检测器在航拍图像中的小目标检测上表现不佳，主要原因是小目标特征有限且在网络传播中容易退化，以及小目标在训练中承受不成比例的回归惩罚。

Method: 使用跨尺度空间通道注意力逐步丰富每层特征并加强跨层特征共享(SARL)，重新设计IoU损失函数为小目标分配更高权重(SAL)。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验表明，该方法在YOLOv5和YOLOx中提升5.5% AP，在噪声数据集上达到29.0% AP。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升小目标检测性能，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recently, despite the remarkable advancements in object detection, modern detectors still struggle to detect tiny objects in aerial images. One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines. Moreover, it also promotes the robust performance with 29.0\% AP on the real-world noisy dataset (\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD-v2.0).

Abstract: Automated medical image captioning translates complex radiological images into diagnostic narratives that can support reporting workflows. We present a Swin-BART encoder-decoder system with a lightweight regional attention module that amplifies diagnostically salient regions before cross-attention. Trained and evaluated on ROCO, our model achieves state-of-the-art semantic fidelity while remaining compact and interpretable. We report results as mean$\pm$std over three seeds and include $95\%$ confidence intervals. Compared with baselines, our approach improves ROUGE (proposed 0.603, ResNet-CNN 0.356, BLIP2-OPT 0.255) and BERTScore (proposed 0.807, BLIP2-OPT 0.645, ResNet-CNN 0.623), with competitive BLEU, CIDEr, and METEOR. We further provide ablations (regional attention on/off and token-count sweep), per-modality analysis (CT/MRI/X-ray), paired significance tests, and qualitative heatmaps that visualize the regions driving each description. Decoding uses beam search (beam size $=4$), length penalty $=1.1$, $no\_repeat\_ngram\_size$ $=3$, and max length $=128$. The proposed design yields accurate, clinically phrased captions and transparent regional attributions, supporting safe research use with a human in the loop.

Conclusion: 通过捕捉渐进跨域特征演化和动态调节适应路径，该方法有效弥合源域-未知域分布差距，显著提升对未见域偏移的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), aiming to transfer a detector trained on one source domain to multiple unknown domains. Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/2490o/LTFE.

Conclusion: MosaicDoc为视觉丰富文档理解领域提供了权威基准，明确了未来研究的方向，表明现有模型在处理复杂文档布局方面仍有不足。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capabilities are inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks, which are predominantly English-centric, feature simplistic layouts, and support limited tasks. Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU. Sourced from newspapers and magazines, MosaicDoc features diverse and complex layouts (including multi-column and non-Manhattan), rich stylistic variety from 196 publishers, and comprehensive multi-task annotations (OCR, VQA, reading order, and localization). With 72K images and over 600K QA pairs, MosaicDoc serves as a definitive benchmark for the field. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their current limitations in handling real-world document complexity and charts a clear path for future research.

Conclusion: SLDC通过补偿分布漂移有效解决了序列微调中的关键问题，为类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that sequential fine-tuning (SeqFT) of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs), followed by classifier refinement using approximate distributions of class features, can be an effective strategy for class-incremental learning (CIL). However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in many real-world applications such as pedestrian trajectory tracking. However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TSPE-GS能够有效解决半透明表面重建中的交叉表面深度模糊问题，且无需额外训练开销即可推广到其他基于高斯的重建流程中。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

Abstract: Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.

Abstract: Foundation models, especially vision-language models (VLMs), offer compelling zero-shot object detection for applications like autonomous driving, a domain where manual labelling is prohibitively expensive. However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\%$ to $46.61\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset. We observe similar performance improvements for the ACDC and BDD100k datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, especially diffusion models, have significantly improved image restoration (IR) performance. However, existing problem-agnostic diffusion model-based image restoration (DMIR) methods face challenges in fully leveraging diffusion priors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the limitations of current problem-agnostic DMIR methods by analyzing their sampling process and providing effective solutions. We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出DiVE方法，通过约束预训练模型和微调模型嵌入之间的差异向量来保持几何结构，从而在ID数据上鲁棒微调视觉语言模型而不损害OOD和零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒微调方法在重用对比学习时会扭曲嵌入的几何结构，这限制了OOD和零样本性能。需要一种能保持几何结构的微调方法。

Method: 提出差异向量均衡化(DiVE)，通过约束预训练模型和微调模型嵌入的差异向量来保持几何结构。使用平均向量损失(AVL)全局保持几何结构，使用成对向量损失(PVL)局部保持多模态对齐。

Result: 实验表明DiVE有效保持了几何结构，在ID、OOD和零样本指标上都取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: DiVE方法通过约束差异向量来保持几何结构，实现了在ID数据上鲁棒微调的同时不损害OOD和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate strong generalization abilities in zero-shot classification by leveraging embeddings extracted from image and text encoders. This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.

Motivation: 解决现有场景文本编辑方法在低资源语言支持、合成与真实数据域差距以及文本风格保持评估指标方面的不足。

Method: 使用语言自适应字形编码器进行多语言编辑，采用多阶段训练策略（先在合成数据预训练，后在真实图像微调），并构建STIPLAR数据集。

Conclusion: STELLAR通过创新的训练策略和评估指标，有效解决了多语言场景文本编辑的关键挑战，在低资源语言和真实数据上表现出色。

Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is the task of modifying text content in an image while preserving its visual style, such as font, color, and background. While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that STELLAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual consistency and recognition accuracy, achieving an average TAS improvement of 2.2% across languages over the baselines.

Conclusion: MOBA揭示了一类新的物理可实现威胁，强调了在真实环境中考虑材料级属性的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%. Our work reveals a new class of physically realizable threats and underscores the urgent need for defenses that account for material-level properties in real-world environments.

Abstract: Weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation is essential for 3D scene understanding, especially as the growing scale of data and high annotation costs associated with fully supervised approaches. Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Conclusion: LampQ通过克服现有混合精度量化方法的三大局限性，实现了对Vision Transformer的准确量化，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained Vision Transformer model? Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of medical images demands robust modeling of complex visual-semantic relationships while addressing annotation scarcity, label imbalance, and clinical plausibility constraints. We introduce MIRNet (Medical Image Reasoner Network), a novel framework that integrates self-supervised pre-training with constrained graph-based reasoning. Tongue image diagnosis is a particularly challenging domain that requires fine-grained visual and semantic understanding. Our approach leverages self-supervised masked autoencoder (MAE) to learn transferable visual representations from unlabeled data; employs graph attention networks (GAT) to model label correlations through expert-defined structured graphs; enforces clinical priors via constraint-aware optimization using KL divergence and regularization losses; and mitigates imbalance using asymmetric loss (ASL) and boosting ensembles. To address annotation scarcity, we also introduce TongueAtlas-4K, a comprehensive expert-curated benchmark comprising 4,000 images annotated with 22 diagnostic labels--representing the largest public dataset in tongue analysis. Validation shows our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. While optimized for tongue diagnosis, the framework readily generalizes to broader diagnostic medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration in physical environments requires understanding not only what to act upon, but also where the actionable elements are and how to interact with them. Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose Anomagic, a zero-shot anomaly generation method that produces semantically coherent anomalies without requiring any exemplar anomalies. By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.

Conclusion: DGFusion通过双引导范式和难度感知实例匹配，有效解决了多模态3D物体检测中困难实例检测的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: As a critical task in autonomous driving perception systems, 3D object detection is used to identify and track key objects, such as vehicles and pedestrians. However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\% mAP, +0.8\% NDS, and +1.3\% average recall on nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent robustness gains for hard instance detection across ego-distance, size, visibility, and small-scale training scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于UDF的3D VAE框架能够有效处理复杂拓扑结构，在保持几何细节的同时实现超高分辨率3D内容生成，为复杂3D几何表示提供了更鲁棒和计算高效的解决方案

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D contents remains a fundamental challenge due to the complexity of representing arbitrary topologies-such as open surfaces and intricate internal structures-while preserving geometric details. Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction accuracy and generative quality, yielding superior surface smoothness and geometric flexibility.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection has gained sufficient attention due to its detection performance in low light, fog, and rain conditions. However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle. Extensive experimental results have verified that our proposed FreDFT achieves excellent performance on multiple public datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) methods aim to identify and outline defects without using any labeled samples. In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples. Our framework flexibly works on both the full dataset and smaller subsets with consistently robust performance, ensuring seamless adaptability across diverse product lines. In aid of the novel framework, MuSc-V2 achieves significant performance improvements: a $\textbf{+23.7\%}$ AP gain on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and a $\textbf{+19.3\%}$ boost on the Eyecandies dataset, surpassing previous zero-shot benchmarks and even outperforming most few-shot methods.

*Zhiyuan Hu,Zheng Sun,Yi Wei,Long Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完整的图像筛选解决方案，包括构建包含128k样本的全面数据集，以及引入HCM-GRPO方法来提升多模态大语言模型的图像美学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成性能显著提升，但图像筛选研究稀少，且多模态大语言模型在图像美学推理方面表现不佳，主要由于缺乏数据和模型推理能力弱。

Method: 收集包含128k样本的全面数据集，评估四个美学方面；采用多种标注方法获取高质量思维链数据；提出HCM-GRPO方法，结合困难案例挖掘和动态比例准确度奖励。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的闭源MLLMs在图像美学推理中表现类似随机猜测，而使用HCM-GRPO的小模型能够超越大规模开源和领先闭源模型。

Conclusion: 通过构建全面数据集和开发HCM-GRPO方法，显著提升了MLLMs的图像美学推理能力，证明了该方法在图像筛选任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The performance of image generation has been significantly improved in recent years. However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型是否能识别视觉存在但音频缺失的混淆对象，发现现有模型因视觉主导推理而难以区分不存在的音频。

Method: 提出RL-CoMM方法：1）引入大型音频语言模型作为参考模型生成纯音频推理，设计逐步推理奖励函数；2）引入答案中心置信度优化减少推理差异不确定性。

Result: 在音频-视觉问答和幻觉检测任务上，RL-CoMM相比基线模型准确率提升10-30%，且仅需有限训练数据。

Conclusion: RL-CoMM能有效缓解MLLMs的视觉主导偏差，显著提升音频-视觉推理性能，为多模态模型开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) discern confused objects that are visually present but audio-absent? To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

TL;DR: 提出了GaussMedAct框架，使用多元高斯编码进行医疗动作分析，在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1%的Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升5.9%且仅需10%计算量。

Motivation: 医疗视觉中的细粒度动作评估面临数据集不完整、精度要求严格、快速动作时空动态建模不足等挑战。

Method: 多元高斯表示将关节运动投影到时间缩放的多维空间，将动作分解为自适应3D高斯作为token；混合空间编码采用笛卡尔和向量双流策略利用骨骼信息。

Result: 在CPREval-6k数据集上达到92.1% Top-1准确率，比ST-GCN基线提升5.9%，仅需10% FLOPs；跨数据集实验证实了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussMedAct框架通过自适应时空表示学习有效提升了医疗动作分析的精度和效率，在实时推理中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained action evaluation in medical vision faces unique challenges due to the unavailability of comprehensive datasets, stringent precision requirements, and insufficient spatiotemporal dynamic modeling of very rapid actions. To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs. Cross-dataset experiments confirm the superiority of our method in robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类中，模型常因过度依赖预测置信度而产生确认偏误，在稀疏标注或类别不平衡时容易过拟合错误预测，缺乏不确定性感知能力。

Method: 采用闭环学习过程：1) 感知阶段估计认知不确定性识别模糊区域；2) 行动阶段使用不确定性引导的双重采样策略；3) 校正阶段通过细粒度动态分配策略处理伪标签数据。

Conclusion: CABIN通过认知感知的闭环学习机制有效解决了高光谱分类中的置信度误导问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Confidence alone is often misleading in hyperspectral image classification, as models tend to mistake high predictive scores for correctness while lacking awareness of uncertainty. This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization. Experimental results show that a wide range of state-of-the-art methods benefit from the integration of CABIN, with improved labeling efficiency and performance.

*Gwangyeon Ahn,Jiwan Seo,Joonhyuk Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLF-MSC是一种统一的多模态语义通信系统，通过传输单一的视觉语言特征来同时支持图像和文本生成，提高了频谱效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义通信技术通常单独处理每种模态，需要特定的模态流或重传，导致频谱效率低下。VLF-MSC旨在通过统一的视觉语言表示来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型将源图像编码为视觉语言语义特征，通过无线信道传输。接收端基于该特征，使用解码器语言模型生成描述性文本，使用扩散模型生成语义对齐的图像。

Result: 实验表明，VLF-MSC在低信噪比下优于仅文本和仅图像的基线方法，对两种模态都实现了更高的语义准确性，同时显著减少了带宽需求。

Conclusion: VLF-MSC通过统一的视觉语言特征表示，实现了高效的多模态语义通信，在保持语义保真度的同时提高了系统鲁棒性和频谱效率。

Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

*Xiangyue Zhang,Jianfang Li,Jianqiang Ren,Jiaxu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlobalDiff是一个基于扩散模型的框架，首次直接在全局关节旋转空间中进行语音驱动动作生成，通过多级约束方案解决全局旋转空间缺乏结构先验的问题，显著减少了层次误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法通常在局部关节旋转上操作，这会导致层次误差累积，表现为末端效应器的不稳定和不合理运动。需要一种能够从根本上解耦关节预测并缓解层次误差累积的方法。

Method: 提出GlobalDiff框架，在全局关节旋转空间直接操作。引入多级约束方案：关节结构约束使用虚拟锚点捕捉细粒度方向；骨架结构约束保持骨骼间的角度一致性；时间结构约束使用多尺度变分编码器对齐生成运动与真实时间模式。

Result: 在标准语音驱动动作基准测试中，GlobalDiff生成平滑准确的动作，在多个说话者身份下相比当前最优方法性能提升46.0%。

Conclusion: GlobalDiff通过直接在全局旋转空间操作并结合多级约束，有效解决了层次误差累积问题，显著提升了语音驱动动作生成的质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Reliable co-speech motion generation requires precise motion representation and consistent structural priors across all joints. Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridPrune是一种新的视觉token剪枝方法，采用"全局引导、局部选择"的两阶段策略，通过文本条件指导动态分配token预算到空间区域，然后在每个预算区域内进行局部选择，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法主要关注"选择什么"，忽略了"看哪里"的问题，导致空间分配效率低下、位置偏差和保留无关冗余token。受人类视觉系统启发，需要先确定关注区域再精细选择。

Method: 提出GridPrune方法，将剪枝过程分为两步：首先使用文本条件指导动态分配token预算到空间区域，然后在每个预算区域内进行局部选择，替代全局Top-K机制。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B上，GridPrune仅使用11.1%的token就能保持96.98%的完整性能，在相同剪枝率下比最佳基线方法提升2.34%。

Conclusion: GridPrune通过模拟人类视觉系统的两阶段处理策略，有效解决了现有剪枝方法的空间分配效率问题，在各种MLLM架构上都取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to ("where to look") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail ("what to select"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing "what to select", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider "where to look", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a "guide-globally, select-locally" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.

Motivation: 探索如何让大语言模型理解骨骼数据并区分不同动作，解决LLM作为识别器时的骨骼理解和动作区分问题。

Method: 使用现成的大规模视频模型生成视觉和运动信息作为知识库，监督骨骼学习生成离散表示，通过Temporal Query Projection模块建模长序列骨骼信号，最后让LLM理解这些表示并生成动作分类和描述。

Result: 在多个骨骼动作分类基准测试中表现出色，在零样本场景下比基于线性方法更具通用性。

Conclusion: SUGAR框架有效结合了LLM的隐式知识和骨骼数据，实现了高质量的动作识别和描述，在零样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold rich implicit knowledge and powerful transferability. In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要关注单目标攻击，而现实应用中多目标后门攻击威胁更大。由于不同触发器之间存在严重特征干扰，在LVLMs中执行多目标攻击具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MTAttack框架，核心是包含代理空间划分约束和触发器原型锚定约束的优化方法，在潜在空间中联合优化多个触发器，确保每个触发器独立映射到唯一的代理类别并保持可分离性。

Result: 在流行基准测试中，MTAttack实现了高成功率的多目标攻击，显著优于现有攻击方法，并展现出跨数据集的强泛化能力和对后门防御策略的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LVLMs对多目标后门攻击存在严重脆弱性，迫切需要开发相应的缓解措施来应对这种威胁。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various vision-language tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining and instruction tuning. However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

Result: 在动态目标域上实现了优越的适应性能，同时保持了计算效率

Conclusion: RobIA通过输入特定的灵活性和广泛的监督覆盖，在域偏移下提高了泛化能力

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation in real-world environments poses significant challenges due to dynamic domain shifts, sparse or unreliable supervision, and the high cost of acquiring dense ground-truth labels. While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobIA achieves superior adaptation performance across dynamic target domains while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖隐式建模，使用帧级或碎片化视频特征，无法捕捉事件序列的时间连贯性和视觉上下文的完整语义。

Method: CACMI框架包含两个核心组件：跨模态帧聚合通过跨模态检索提取时间连贯的事件对齐文本特征；上下文感知特征增强利用查询引导注意力整合视觉动态与伪事件语义。

Conclusion: CACMI通过显式的时间-语义建模，有效解决了现有方法在时间连贯性和语义完整性方面的不足，为密集视频描述提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense video captioning jointly localizes and captions salient events in untrimmed videos. Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets demonstrate that CACMI achieves the state-of-the-art performance on dense video captioning task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当今领先的文本到图像模型在逻辑组合方面的根本缺陷，特别是处理否定、计数和空间关系等核心逻辑原语时的性能崩溃问题。

Method: 通过分析三个核心逻辑原语（否定、计数、空间关系）的组合表现，研究训练数据缺失、连续注意力架构不适用以及评估指标偏向视觉合理性而非约束满足等关键因素。

Result: 发现模型在单个原语上准确，但在组合时性能急剧下降，暴露严重干扰问题；当前解决方案和简单扩展无法弥合这一差距。

Conclusion: 实现真正的组合性需要在表示和推理方面进行根本性进步，而非对现有架构进行增量调整。

Abstract: The architectural blueprint of today's leading text-to-image models contains a fundamental flaw: an inability to handle logical composition. This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap. Achieving genuine compositionality, we conclude, will require fundamental advances in representation and reasoning rather than incremental adjustments to existing architectures.

Conclusion: split-layer是一种有效的MLP重构方法，能够在不引入过高计算开销的情况下显著增强隐式神经表示的表征能力。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) models signals as continuous functions using neural networks, offering efficient and differentiable optimization for inverse problems across diverse disciplines. However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Fairness is a core element in the trustworthy deployment of deepfake detection models, especially in the field of digital identity security. Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、RSTPReid和ICFG-PEDES三个公开数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: GEA方法通过生成式增强有效解决了文本到图像行人检索中的跨模态对齐挑战

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) aims to retrieve person images based on natural language descriptions. Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 所提出的可解释性驱动方法在保持物理可解释性的同时，实现了有效的多退化图像恢复。

Abstract: Although image restoration has advanced significantly, most existing methods target only a single type of degradation. In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, named InterIR, demonstrates excellent performance in multi-degradation restoration while remaining highly competitive on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate localization of cephalometric landmarks from 2D lateral skull X-rays is vital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. Manual annotation is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas automated approaches often struggle with low contrast and anatomical complexity. This paper introduces CephRes-MHNet, a multi-head residual convolutional network for robust and efficient cephalometric landmark detection. The architecture integrates residual encoding, dual-attention mechanisms, and multi-head decoders to enhance contextual reasoning and anatomical precision. Trained on the Aariz Cephalometric dataset of 1,000 radiographs, CephRes-MHNet achieved a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.23 mm and a success detection rate (SDR) @ 2.0 mm of 85.5%, outperforming all evaluated models. In particular, it exceeded the strongest baseline, the attention-driven AFPF-Net (MRE = 1.25 mm, SDR @ 2.0 mm = 84.1%), while using less than 25% of its parameters. These results demonstrate that CephRes-MHNet attains state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural efficiency, providing a practical solution for real-world orthodontic analysis.

Method: VISTA结合了三个关键组件：(i)交叉注意力融合模块整合长期意图和过去运动；(ii)社交令牌注意力机制实现灵活的多智能体交互建模；(iii)成对注意力图在推理时提供可解释的社交影响模式。

Result: 在高密度MADRAS基准和SDD数据集上，VISTA实现了最先进的准确性，显著减少了碰撞率。在MADRAS上将平均碰撞率从2.14%降至0.03%，在SDD上实现零碰撞同时改进ADE、FDE和minFDE指标。

Conclusion: VISTA能够生成社交合规、目标感知且可解释的轨迹，对于安全关键的自控系统具有重要应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Conclusion: LiNeXt在效率和效果上均优于扩散方法，适用于实时场景补全任务

Abstract: 3D LiDAR scene completion from point clouds is a fundamental component of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges. Accordingly, we propose the Distance-aware Selected Repeat strategy to generate a more uniformly distributed noisy point cloud. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, LiNeXt achieves a 199.8x speedup in inference, reduces Chamfer Distance by 50.7%, and uses only 6.1% of the parameters compared with LiDiff. These results demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of LiNeXt for real-time scene completion.

Conclusion: HeatV2X通过异构适应设计，在最小化训练成本的同时大幅提升了协同框架的性能，解决了V2X协同感知中的异构性和可扩展性挑战。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception extends sensing beyond single vehicle limits through transmission. However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior perception performance with significantly reduced training overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our implementation will be released soon.

Abstract: Recent multimodal deepfake detection methods designed for generalization conjecture that single-stage supervised training struggles to generalize across unseen manipulations and datasets. However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples. Our model, evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrates strong generalization and precise temporal localization.

Conclusion: TubeRMC框架通过管状条件重建和互约束机制，有效解决了弱监督时空视频定位中的目标识别和跟踪一致性问题。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube that corresponds to a given language query in an untrimmed video. This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG. Further visualization shows that TubeRMC effectively mitigates both target identification errors and inconsistent tracking.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate and score sports actions, which has attracted widespread interest in recent years. Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) extends traditional facial emotion recognition by incorporating explainable, fine-grained reasoning. The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.

Result: 在四个标准FGVC基准测试上的综合实验验证了H3Former框架的优越性。

Conclusion: H3Former通过高阶语义关系和结构化区域级建模有效提升了细粒度视觉分类性能，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) remains a challenging task due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations. Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉推理任务中存在推理链错误传播问题，而传统的监督微调需要昂贵的步骤级标注，基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法只能提供稀疏的结果级反馈，限制了稳定优化。

Result: 在七个基准测试和四个VLM骨干网络上，PROPA持续优于基于监督微调和RLVR的基线方法，在域内任务上获得高达17.0%的提升，在域外任务上获得21.0%的提升。

Conclusion: PROPA为视觉推理任务建立了强大的推理和泛化能力，提供了一种无需人工标注的有效后训练方法。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with complex visual reasoning, where multi-step dependencies cause early errors to cascade through the reasoning chain. Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然能生成高质量视频描述，但高内存、计算和部署需求限制了其在BLV用户中的实际应用，需要研究模型规模对可访问性描述质量的影响。

Method: 使用SmolVLM2的500M和2.2B参数变体，在两个数据集（AVCaps户外和Charades室内）上评估，提出多上下文BLV框架和导航辅助框架，系统评估四种提示策略，并在智能手机上测试FP32和INT8精度变体。

Result: 评估了模型在不同上下文（空间定向、社交互动、动作事件、环境氛围）和导航辅助信息上的表现，以及在资源受限移动设备上的实际性能约束。

Conclusion: 该研究为BLV可访问性评估提供了专门框架，并验证了较小模型在移动设备上的可行性，为实际部署提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at understanding and generating video descriptions but their high memory, computation, and deployment demands hinder practical use particularly for blind and low-vision (BLV) users who depend on detailed, context-aware descriptions. To study the effect of model size on accessibility-focused description quality, we evaluate SmolVLM2 variants with 500M and 2.2B parameters across two diverse datasets: AVCaps (outdoor), and Charades (indoor). In this work, we introduce two novel evaluation frameworks specifically designed for BLV accessibility assessment: the Multi-Context BLV Framework evaluating spatial orientation, social interaction, action events, and ambience contexts; and the Navigational Assistance Framework focusing on mobility-critical information. Additionally, we conduct a systematic evaluation of four different prompt design strategies and deploy both models on a smartphone, evaluating FP32 and INT8 precision variants to assess real-world performance constraints on resource-limited mobile devices.

TL;DR: RUDDER是一个低开销框架，通过单次前向传播提取视觉证据向量，并使用自适应门控机制来减少大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，在保持高效率的同时达到与最先进方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，生成与视觉输入不一致的文本，严重影响可靠性。现有的推理时干预方法虽然有效，但计算开销大，通常需要额外前向传播，限制了在实际延迟敏感场景中的应用。

Method: 提出RUDDER框架，包含两个关键创新：(1) CARD向量：在单次标准前向传播中从自注意力层的残差更新中提取每样本视觉证据向量；(2) 贝叶斯启发的自适应门控：执行令牌级注入，根据模型偏离视觉上下文的情况调整校正信号的强度。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR等关键幻觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RUDDER在引入可忽略计算延迟的同时，实现了与最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: RUDDER是一个实用有效的框架，能够在不大幅牺牲效率的情况下提高大视觉语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual inputs, which can critically undermine their reliability. Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GRAM框架，通过混合专家架构和测试时自适应方法，无需目标区域标注数据即可实现稳健的贫民窟分割，解决了贫民窟形态异质性导致的模型泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星贫民窟分割对全球城市贫困估算有重要意义，但贫民窟形态异质性阻碍了模型在未见区域的泛化能力，需要解决跨区域泛化问题。

Method: 构建百万级卫星图像数据集，采用混合专家架构学习区域特定特征和通用特征，通过测试时自适应利用预测一致性过滤不可靠伪标签。

Result: GRAM在非洲城市等低资源场景中优于现有方法，为全球贫民窟测绘提供了可扩展的标签高效解决方案。

Conclusion: GRAM框架通过无监督自适应方法有效解决了贫民窟分割的跨区域泛化挑战，为数据驱动的城市规划提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Satellite-based slum segmentation holds significant promise in generating global estimates of urban poverty. However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions. GRAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in low-resource settings such as African cities, offering a scalable and label-efficient solution for global slum mapping and data-driven urban planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaViT通过让LLM同时作为视觉编码器，解决了LLaVA架构中视觉特征整合不足的问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于LLaVA基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLaVA架构在处理视觉语言任务时存在文本和视觉模态不匹配的问题，导致视觉特征整合效果不佳。

Method: 通过三个关键修改让LLM同时作为视觉编码器：1) 为视觉模态学习独立的QKV投影；2) 在视觉token上启用双向注意力；3) 结合全局和局部视觉表示。

Result: 在广泛的LLM上进行控制实验，LLaViT在多个基准测试中显著优于LLaVA基线方法，甚至超过参数数量翻倍的模型。

Conclusion: LLaViT为视觉语言建模提供了一种更有效的方法，通过让LLM同时作为视觉编码器来解决模态不匹配问题。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the LLaVA architecture for vision-language tasks, its design inherently struggles to effectively integrate visual features due to the inherent mismatch between text and vision modalities. We tackle this issue from a novel perspective in which the LLM not only serves as a language model but also a powerful vision encoder. To this end, we present LLaViT - Large Language Models as extended Vision Transformers - which enables the LLM to simultaneously function as a vision encoder through three key modifications: (1) learning separate QKV projections for vision modality, (2) enabling bidirectional attention on visual tokens, and (3) incorporating both global and local visual representations. Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前行人检测的性能基准存在缺陷，现有评估指标无法真实反映DNN在行人检测中的性能表现，特别是在安全关键场景下的评估不够充分。

Method: 利用图像分割提供的细粒度街道场景信息，自动区分八种不同的检测错误类别，提出新的性能比较指标，并比较了简化版APD的各种骨干网络。

Conclusion: 提出的新评估方法能够更准确地比较行人检测模型，特别是在安全关键性能方面，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的性能评估框架。

Abstract: Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLIP4VI-ReID网络，通过文本语义生成、红外特征嵌入和高层语义对齐三个模块，解决可见光-红外行人重识别中的模态差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可见光图像和红外图像在物理特性上存在巨大差异，导致跨模态行人重识别任务面临挑战，需要有效的方法来弥合模态间的差距。

Method: 使用文本语义生成模块为可见光图像生成文本描述，红外特征嵌入模块利用文本语义修正红外图像特征，高层语义对齐模块优化语义对齐，使文本语义仅包含身份相关信息。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的VI-ReID数据集上，CLIP4VI-ReID取得了优于其他最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本作为桥梁，实现了可见光-红外的间接模态对齐，学习到的模态共享表示具有更好的判别性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven modality-shared representation learning network named CLIP4VI-ReID for VI-ReID task, which consists of Text Semantic Generation (TSG), Infrared Feature Embedding (IFE), and High-level Semantic Alignment (HSA). Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP4VI-ReID achieves superior performance than other state-of-the-art methods on some widely used VI-ReID datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决远场区域深度估计不准确和近场区域结构退化的问题，需要一种能处理极端深度变化的统一框架。

Method: 采用双监督机制：1) 景深监督使用单目深度估计器生成深度先验，通过散焦卷积合成物理准确的散焦图像，利用景深损失增强几何一致性；2) 多视角一致性监督使用LoFTR特征匹配最小化跨视角几何误差，通过最小二乘优化确保深度一致性。

Result: 在Waymo Open Dataset上实现了0.8 dB的PSNR提升，显著改善了远场和近场区域的深度保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了散焦物理原理和学习型深度正则化，为城市环境中复杂深度分层问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

TL;DR: DSANet是一个弱监督视频异常检测方法，通过粗粒度和细粒度特征解耦来增强异常与正常模式的区分能力，在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态基础模型的弱监督视频异常检测方法倾向于检测最显著响应片段，忽略了挖掘与异常分离的多样化正常模式，且容易因外观相似性导致类别混淆，导致细粒度分类结果不理想。

Method: 提出解耦语义对齐网络(DSANet)：1) 粗粒度层面：引入自引导正常建模分支，通过学习正常原型重构输入视频特征；2) 细粒度层面：提出解耦对比语义对齐机制，将视频分解为事件中心和背景中心组件，应用视觉-语言对比学习。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime两个标准基准测试上的综合实验表明，DSANet优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: DSANet通过显式分离异常和正常特征，从粗粒度和细粒度角度增强区分能力，有效解决了现有方法在挖掘正常模式和细粒度分类方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的CLIP语义增强方法往往忽略特征分布结构和频域特性，而这些对于模型鲁棒性至关重要。

Result: 在多样化天气驾驶基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了CLIP的语义对齐优势，还增强了跨域的特征多样性和结构一致性。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for object detection aims to train a model on a single source domain that can generalize effectively to unseen target domains. While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains. Extensive experiments on the diverse weather-driving benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: AI-based dermatology adoption remains limited by biased datasets, variable image quality, and limited validation. We introduce DermAI, a lightweight, smartphone-based application that enables real-time capture, annotation, and classification of skin lesions during routine consultations. Unlike prior dermoscopy-focused tools, DermAI performs on-device quality checks, and local model adaptation. The DermAI clinical dataset, encompasses a wide range of skin tones, ethinicity and source devices. In preliminary experiments, models trained on public datasets failed to generalize to our samples, while fine-tuning with local data improved performance. These results highlight the importance of standardized, diverse data collection aligned with healthcare needs and oriented to machine learning development.

Motivation: 地理空间基础模型在预训练中未被充分代表的环境中表现不可靠，需要开发能够识别和缓解这种不可靠性的方法。

Method: 整合三种互补信号：输入空间的OOD检测、嵌入空间的OOD检测和任务特定预测不确定性，应用于烧伤疤痕分割任务。

Result: OOD分数与特定环境条件下的较低性能相关，基于不确定性的标志有助于丢弃许多表现不佳的预测。失败集中在某些地理区域，如低海拔区域和大型河流区域。

Conclusion: SHRUG-FM为在气候敏感应用中更安全、更可解释地部署地理空间基础模型提供了途径，有助于弥合基准性能与现实世界可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.

Conclusion: MSGNav通过保留视觉证据和解决最后一英里问题，为零样本导航提供了有效解决方案，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON datasets. The open-source code will be publicly available.

Motivation: DreamBooth等个性化AI应用存在面部身份泄露风险，现有防御方法声称能通过对抗扰动保护用户隐私，但实际上存在严重漏洞。

Method: 提出AntiDB_Purify评估框架，系统评估现有防御方法在传统图像滤波和对抗净化等现实威胁下的鲁棒性。

Result: 测试发现所有现有防御方法在净化攻击下都失去保护效果，对抗扰动可被简单滤波有效移除。

Conclusion: 当前防御方法提供虚假安全感，迫切需要更隐蔽和鲁棒的保护机制来保障个性化生成中的用户身份安全。

Abstract: Personalized AI applications such as DreamBooth enable the generation of customized content from user images, but also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly the risk of facial identity leakage. Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.

Abstract: Lane detection is an important topic in the future mobility solutions. Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets. The code will be made available upon publication.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

TL;DR: MonkeyOCR v1.5是一个统一的视觉语言框架，通过两阶段解析流程增强文档布局理解和内容识别，在复杂文档解析任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界文档通常具有复杂布局，包含多级表格、嵌入式图像或公式以及跨页结构，这对现有OCR系统构成挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段解析流程：第一阶段使用大型多模态模型联合预测文档布局和阅读顺序；第二阶段在检测区域内进行文本、公式和表格的局部识别。针对复杂表格结构，提出基于视觉一致性的强化学习方案和两个专门模块（图像解耦表格解析和类型引导表格合并）。

Result: 在OmniDocBench v1.5上的综合实验表明，MonkeyOCR v1.5实现了最先进的性能，优于PPOCR-VL和MinerU 2.5，在视觉复杂文档场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MonkeyOCR v1.5通过统一的视觉语言框架有效解决了复杂文档解析的挑战，特别是在处理多级表格、嵌入式内容和跨页结构方面表现出色。

Abstract: Document parsing is a core task in document intelligence, supporting applications such as information extraction, retrieval-augmented generation, and automated document analysis. However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns. Comprehensive experiments on OmniDocBench v1.5 demonstrate that MonkeyOCR v1.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming PPOCR-VL and MinerU 2.5 while showing exceptional robustness in visually complex document scenarios.

TL;DR: GrounDiff是首个基于扩散模型的DTM生成框架，通过去噪任务迭代去除非地面结构，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DTM生成方法依赖手动调参，而学习型方法需要复杂架构和后处理。需要更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出GrounDiff扩散框架，采用门控设计和置信度引导生成；提出PrioStitch方法使用下采样全局先验指导局部高分辨率预测。

Result: 在ALS2DTM上RMSE降低93%，USGS基准上降低47%；道路重建任务中距离误差降低81%，同时保持表面平滑度。

Conclusion: GrounDiff在DTM生成和道路重建任务中均优于现有方法，证明了扩散模型在地形建模中的有效性。

Abstract: Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) represent the bare-earth elevation and are important in numerous geospatial applications. Such data models cannot be directly measured by sensors and are typically generated from Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from LiDAR or photogrammetry. Traditional filtering approaches rely on manually tuned parameters, while learning-based methods require well-designed architectures, often combined with post-processing. To address these challenges, we introduce Ground Diffusion (GrounDiff), the first diffusion-based framework that iteratively removes non-ground structures by formulating the problem as a denoising task. We incorporate a gated design with confidence-guided generation that enables selective filtering. To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization. Our variant for road reconstruction, GrounDiff+, is specifically designed to produce even smoother surfaces, further surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了诊断结果的可解释性，为风力涡轮机运维提供了实用的决策支持

Abstract: The health condition of wind turbine (WT) components is crucial for ensuring stable and reliable operation. However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.

Abstract: Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
  To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
  We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce a curated video dataset of laboratory rodents for automatic detection of convulsive events. The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Method: 使用语义分割从全玻片图像中提取腺体作为生物学意义输入补丁，用于多实例学习和表型分析。

Result: 在ProMPT队列上获得腺体级别Dice分数0.83±0.17；在ICGC-C和TCGA-PRAD队列中提取38万个腺体，将MIL模型检测EMT和MYC相关基因拷贝数变异的AUC提升10%，发现15个腺体簇与癌症复发、致癌突变和高Gleason评分相关。

Conclusion: HIT通过关注生物学意义结构，提高了MIL预测的准确性和可解释性，同时简化了计算。

Abstract: Histopathologists establish cancer grade by assessing histological structures, such as glands in prostate cancer. Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.

Conclusion: 该框架将基于GAN的超分辨率转变为配置驱动的工作流程，便于在不同地球观测数据集上部署超分辨率管道。

Abstract: We present OpenSR-SRGAN, an open and modular framework for single-image super-resolution in Earth Observation. The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference. By turning GAN-based super-resolution into a configuration-driven workflow, OpenSR-SRGAN lowers the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners who wish to experiment with SRGANs, compare models in a reproducible way, and deploy super-resolution pipelines across diverse Earth-observation datasets.

Motivation: 2型糖尿病早期检测很重要，但胰腺表面分叶度在糖尿病中的作用尚未充分研究。本研究旨在开发自动化方法检测PSL并用于糖尿病筛查。

Method: 使用四种深度学习模型在584名患者数据集上分割胰腺，自动检测PSL，并建立多变量模型预测糖尿病。

Result: 糖尿病患者PSL显著更高(4.26±8.32 vs 3.19±3.62, p=0.01)，PancAP模型分割效果最佳(Dice=0.79±0.17)，多变量模型预测糖尿病AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 胰腺表面分叶度对2型糖尿病筛查有用，可能有助于预测糖尿病早期发病。

Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\% sensitivity, and 91.9\% specificity. Our results suggest that PSL is useful for T2DM screening and could potentially help predict the early onset of T2DM.

Result: 相比标准ViT实现了高达40%的计算效率提升，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: SPOT提供了一种高效且可解释的token稀疏化方法，可适应不同资源约束，适用于各种ViT架构。

Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

Conclusion: LTV为黑盒CNN提供了可解释的替代方案，并为3D和数据一致性驱动的重建奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although Total Variation (TV) performs well in noise reduction and edge preservation on images, its dependence on the lambda parameter limits its efficiency and makes it difficult to use effectively. In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/itu-biai/deep_tv_for_ldct

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced in robotic manipulation, yet practical deployment remains hindered by two key limitations: 1) perceptual redundancy, where irrelevant visual inputs are processed inefficiently, and 2) superficial instruction-vision alignment, which hampers semantic grounding of actions. In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA

Conclusion: StM策略通过信息映射机制有效解决了分离建模组件间的协调问题，实现了更高质量的动态人类与场景交互重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans interacting with real-world environments from monocular videos is an important and challenging task. Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings. Extensive experiments on monocular video datasets demonstrate that StM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and rendering accuracy, particularly at challenging human-scene interaction boundaries.

Abstract: Despite advances in generation quality, current text-to-image (T2I) models often lack diversity, generating homogeneous outputs. This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.
  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle. This research offers a robust methodology and insights, paving the way for improvements in T2I model diversity and metric development.

Abstract: Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.

TL;DR: OmniVGGT是一个新颖的3D基础模型框架，能够有效利用任意数量的几何模态（如深度、相机参数等）进行训练和推理，通过GeoAdapter和随机多模态融合机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D基础模型大多只使用RGB输入，忽略了可用的几何线索（如相机内参、位姿、深度图），导致性能受限。

Method: 提出GeoAdapter使用零初始化卷积渐进注入几何信息，不破坏基础模型表示空间；采用随机多模态融合机制在训练时随机采样模态子集，支持任意数量模态输入。

Result: 在单目/多视角深度估计、多视角立体视觉和相机位姿估计任务中表现优于现有方法，即使仅使用RGB输入也能达到SOTA；集成到VLA模型中在机器人任务上获得持续增益。

Conclusion: OmniVGGT有效利用几何线索提升3D视觉任务性能，具有实际应用价值，特别是在机器人领域。

Abstract: General 3D foundation models have started to lead the trend of unifying diverse vision tasks, yet most assume RGB-only inputs and ignore readily available geometric cues (e.g., camera intrinsics, poses, and depth maps). To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.

TL;DR: M&M-3D是一种参数免费的3D推理架构，通过构建恶性引导的3D特征并与切片级信息混合，在保持与2D模型相同参数量的同时实现3D推理，解决了数字乳腺断层合成数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字乳腺断层合成（DBT）数据稀缺问题，避免现有方法丢弃体积信息或需要复杂架构和大量训练数据的缺点。

Method: 提出M&M-3D架构，通过修改M&M操作而不增加参数，构建恶性引导的3D特征，并通过重复混合3D特征与切片级信息来学习3D推理，实现从FFDM模型的直接权重迁移。

Result: 在定位任务上比2D投影和3D切片方法提升11-54%，分类任务提升3-10%；在低数据情况下比复杂3D变体定位提升20-47%，分类提升2-10%；在BCS-DBT基准上分类提升4%，定位提升10%。

Conclusion: M&M-3D在保持参数效率的同时实现了有效的3D推理，在数据稀缺情况下显著优于现有方法，为DBT分析提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentinel-2影像的LULC分类面临空间异质性、上下文信息和特征模糊性等关键数据挑战，需要一种能够同时处理局部细节和全局上下文的方法。

Method: 1) 设计基于对象的图像分析Mamba模型，使用超像素作为Mamba标记减少冗余计算；2) 构建全局-局部双分支CNN-Mamba架构，联合建模局部空间细节和全局上下文信息；3) 设计多任务优化框架，采用双损失函数平衡局部精度和全局一致性。

Conclusion: MSOM方法通过整合超像素分割、双分支架构和多任务优化，有效解决了Sentinel-2 LULC分类中的关键挑战，实现了优于现有最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Although Sentinel-2 based land use and land cover (LULC) classification is critical for various environmental monitoring applications, it is a very difficult task due to some key data challenges (e.g., spatial heterogeneity, context information, signature ambiguity). This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LUA是一个轻量级模块，在VAE解码前直接在生成器的潜在代码上执行超分辨率，避免了传统图像超分辨率的延迟和伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型难以扩展到超出训练分辨率，直接高分辨率采样成本高，而传统图像超分辨率方法在解码后操作会引入伪影和额外延迟。

Method: 使用共享Swin风格骨干网络和尺度特定像素重排头，在潜在空间中进行单次前向传播实现超分辨率，无需修改基础模型或添加额外扩散阶段。

Result: 在解码和上采样时间上比像素空间SR快近3倍（仅增加0.42秒），同时保持可比较的感知质量，并在不同VAE的潜在空间上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LUA提供了实用高效的高保真图像合成路径，在保持原生高分辨率生成保真度的同时实现可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to scale beyond their training resolutions, as direct high-resolution sampling is slow and costly, while post-hoc image super-resolution (ISR) introduces artifacts and additional latency by operating after decoding. We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.

TL;DR: Depth Anything 3 (DA3) 是一个从任意数量视觉输入预测空间一致几何的模型，无需已知相机位姿，使用简单Transformer架构和单一深度射线预测目标，在多项几何任务上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追求最小化建模，探索是否能用简单的架构实现复杂的几何预测任务，避免复杂的多任务学习。

Method: 使用单一普通Transformer（如DINO编码器）作为骨干网络，采用单一深度射线预测目标，通过师生训练范式进行训练。

Result: 在新建的视觉几何基准测试中，DA3在所有任务上达到新SOTA，相机位姿精度平均提升44.3%，几何精度提升25.1%，在单目深度估计上超越DA2。

Conclusion: 简单架构足以实现复杂的几何预测任务，DA3在几何理解方面取得了显著进展，所有模型仅使用公开学术数据集训练。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything 3 (DA3), a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from an arbitrary number of visual inputs, with or without known camera poses. In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation. All models are trained exclusively on public academic datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS)方法，通过视觉扰动和轨迹重采样来解决多模态大语言模型在强化学习中正确猜测但推理错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态推理基准测试中，强化学习面临一个被忽视的问题：即使推理链错误但最终猜对选项的轨迹，与真正正确推理的轨迹获得相同奖励，这影响了学习效果。

Method: SCS方法：(i)引入小的视觉扰动；(ii)对初始轨迹进行重复截断和重采样；通过轨迹间的一致性生成可微的一致性分数，在策略更新时降低不可靠轨迹的权重。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型上，将SCS集成到RLOO、GRPO和REINFORCE++系列中，在六个多模态基准测试上准确率提升高达7.7个百分点，计算开销可忽略。在Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct和InternVL3-8B模型上也取得显著提升。

Conclusion: SCS为多模态大语言模型的基于结果的强化学习提供了一个简单通用的解决方案，有效解决了正确猜测但推理错误的问题。

Abstract: Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在复杂问题解决中取得突破，其在多智能体系统中的可靠性影响尚未充分探索，需要研究LLM智能体是否能有效提升MAS的可靠性。

Method: 设计了CP-WBFT共识机制，利用LLM的内在反思和辨别能力，采用基于探针的加权信息流传输方法来提升LLM智能体的可靠性。

Conclusion: LLM智能体在处理错误信息流时表现出更强的怀疑特性，CP-WBFT机制有效提升了多智能体系统在不同拓扑结构下的可靠性。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of agent architectures and effectively identifying problematic agents when failures occur are crucial challenges in multi-agent systems (MAS). Advances in large language models (LLMs) have established LLM-based agents as a major branch of MAS, enabling major breakthroughs in complex problem solving and world modeling. However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies. It capitalizes on the intrinsic reflective and discriminative capabilities of LLMs by employing a probe-based, weighted information flow transmission method to improve the reliability of LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-WBFT achieves superior performance across diverse network topologies under extreme Byzantine conditions (85.7\% fault rate). Notably, our approach surpasses traditional methods by attaining remarkable accuracy on various topologies and maintaining strong reliability in both mathematical reasoning and safety assessment tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有向二分图编码器的ICD自动编码方法，通过建模常见代码与罕见代码之间的共现关系来改善长尾分布问题，利用LLM生成代码描述增强嵌入质量，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD自动编码面临巨大标签空间（10,000-20,000个代码）和长尾分布挑战，许多罕见代码缺乏足够的训练数据，需要有效利用代码间的共现关系来提升罕见代码的分类性能。

Method: 构建有向二分图编码器，包含常见代码和罕见代码两个不相交节点集，边从常见代码指向罕见代码，基于条件概率定义连接权重，通过共现编码将偏置注入注意力模块，利用LLM生成代码描述增强初始嵌入。

Result: 在三个ICD自动编码基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，特别是在衡量长尾分类的关键指标Macro-F1上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过建模代码间的细粒度共现关系，结合LLM提供的临床上下文知识，能够有效提升ICD自动编码的性能，特别是在处理长尾分布中的罕见代码时表现优异。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

Result: 对9个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行评估，发现存在持续且显著的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的安全脆弱性，迫切需要开发强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

Conclusion: AgentEvolver通过统一框架实现了代理能力的可扩展、成本效益高且持续改进的自主学习。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Motivation: LayerNorm是transformer中的基础组件，但它在不同架构中对学习和记忆化的影响尚不清楚，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过消除LayerNorm参数，分析Pre-和Post-LayerNorm transformer在13个模型和6个视觉与语言数据集上的表现差异。

Result: 在Pre-LayerNorm模型中移除LayerNorm会加剧记忆化并破坏学习稳定性；在Post-LayerNorm模型中移除LayerNorm能有效缓解记忆化，恢复真实标签。早期层的LayerNorm最为关键。

Conclusion: LayerNorm在transformer中扮演着塑造记忆化和学习的关键角色，其影响因架构不同而异，为理解transformer工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

Conclusion: 该框架为行为健康、教育和数字治疗等领域的人本系统提供了伦理对齐的强化学习方法，旨在启动关于情感感知和可信个性化系统的讨论。

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一个数据集蒸馏框架，通过使用不同架构的教师模型来解耦logit匹配和正则化目标，解决单教师模型带来的归纳偏差问题，在ImageNet-1K上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法通常继承单一教师模型的归纳偏差，随着数据集规模增大，这种偏差会导致生成过于平滑、同质化的样本，降低类内多样性并限制泛化能力。

Method: PRISM框架在合成过程中解耦架构先验，将logit匹配和正则化目标分离，分别使用不同架构的教师模型进行监督：主模型用于logits，随机子集用于批量归一化对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，PRISM在低和中IPC机制下持续优于单教师方法和多教师变体，生成的数据显示出显著更丰富的类内多样性，特征间余弦相似度显著下降。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解耦架构先验有效提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和多样性，并分析了教师选择策略，引入了可扩展的跨类批量形成方案用于快速并行合成。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的黑盒模型无关对抗攻击方法，能够在不改变模型预测结果的情况下显著修改后解释性方法的解释结果，仅需访问模型预测和解释，无需模型内部信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前后解释性方法在安全关键应用中的脆弱性，这些方法可能被轻易操纵而产生误导性解释。

Method: 基于模型预测和解释的单步攻击方法，针对图像领域的后解释性方法（如显著性图、积分梯度、DeepLIFT SHAP），在保持预测类别不变的情况下修改解释结果。

Result: 攻击能显著改变解释结果（通过平均绝对差异衡量），同时保持图像结构相似性（SSIM验证），对ResNet-18和ViT-B16在ImageNet上有效。

Conclusion: 当前后解释性方法存在严重安全漏洞，其可靠性在安全关键应用中值得担忧，需要更鲁棒的解释方法。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Conclusion: 对八个最先进生成模型的分析揭示了这些模型如何未能遵循物理约束，为未来模型改进铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用数据内在维度(ID)作为分类任务中类别不平衡的度量方法，替代传统的基于样本数量的方法，并证明ID比基于基数的重加权和重采样技术表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于样本数量的不平衡度量方法忽略了冗余样本和类别学习难度的差异，而复杂的度量方法如训练损失和不确定性需要训练机器学习模型。

Method: 使用数据内在维度(ID)作为易于计算、无需模型的不平衡度量，可无缝整合到各种不平衡缓解方法中。

Result: 在五个不同不平衡比的数据集上，ID始终优于文献中使用的基于基数的重加权和重采样技术，且ID与基数结合可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 数据内在维度是有效的类别不平衡度量方法，优于传统基数方法，且与基数结合可获得更好效果。

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

*Peining Zhang,Jinbo Bi,Minghu Song*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: VEDA是一个统一的SE(3)-等变框架，结合方差爆炸扩散和退火技术，高效生成构象准确的3D分子结构，在采样效率和构象准确性之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在3D分子生成中的基本权衡问题：基于流的模型速度快但构象不准确，而去噪扩散模型准确但采样慢。

Method: 1) 方差爆炸调度实现类似模拟退火的噪声注入；2) 新的预处理方案协调SE(3)-等变网络与残差扩散目标；3) 基于arcsin的新调度器在关键区间集中采样。

Result: 在QM9和GEOM-DRUGS数据集上，VEDA仅需100步采样就达到基于流模型的效率，获得最先进的价态稳定性和有效性。生成结构非常稳定，GFN2-xTB优化中能量变化中位数仅为1.72 kcal/mol。

Conclusion: VEDA证明了方差爆炸扩散与SE(3)-等变架构的原则性集成可以同时实现高化学准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models show promise for 3D molecular generation, but face a fundamental trade-off between sampling efficiency and conformational accuracy. While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: 开发了逆反射模拟方法并使用黑盒优化来最大化攻击效果，利用逆反射材料仅在受害者车灯照射下激活的特性。

Result: ARP在35米动态场景中达到≥93.4%的成功率，在真实条件下对商业TSR系统达到≥60%成功率，隐蔽性比之前的贴片攻击高≥1.9%。

Conclusion: ARP攻击展示了逆反射材料在对抗攻击中的有效性，同时提出的DPR Shield防御方案对停止标志和限速标志实现了≥75%的防御成功率。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗领域表现良好，但在真实医疗场景中仍表现不佳，需要更强的上下文感知能力来识别缺失细节并提供安全、有帮助的响应

Method: 设计属性条件查询生成器模拟多样化用户上下文，LLM响应后自我评估决策、沟通和安全三个关键方面，然后精炼响应，最后使用监督微调强化上下文感知能力

Result: 在HealthBench数据集上显著提升LLM性能，特别是在上下文感知维度，小型骨干LLM通过知识蒸馏超越教师模型，在HealthBench上达到63.8%的SOTA性能

Conclusion: MuSeR方法有效增强LLM的上下文感知能力，通过自我精炼和知识蒸馏使较小模型超越较大模型，在医疗基准上实现最佳性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in the medical domain, achieving strong performance on several benchmarks. However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Code and dataset will be released at https://muser-llm.github.io.

Conclusion: ProgRAG通过渐进式推理路径扩展和不确定性感知剪枝，显著提升了多跳知识图谱问答的可靠性和推理质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.

Abstract: Fake news detection methods based on writing style have achieved remarkable progress. However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in both robustness and accuracy, effectively addressing the challenges of style sensitivity and LLM usability in fake news detection.

Abstract: Data synthesis for training large reasoning models offers a scalable alternative to limited, human-curated datasets, enabling the creation of high-quality data. However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain. Our code will be made publicly available here.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.

Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

Motivation: 研究社交媒体虚假信息如何通过人类认知偏见、情绪和身份驱动推理而传播，需要开发可模拟和分析这些机制的方法框架。

Method: 使用LLM创建模拟用户偏见和意识形态的人设代理，构建审计-节点框架，让新闻文章在代理网络中传播重写，通过问答式审计器追踪每一步的事实保真度，量化虚假信息指数和传播率。

Result: 实验显示身份和意识形态驱动的人设是虚假信息加速器，尤其在政治、营销和技术领域；专家型人设能保持事实稳定；早期失真后，异质人设互动会迅速将虚假信息升级为宣传级失真。

Conclusion: LLM既能模拟人类偏见，又能作为审计器追踪信息保真度，该框架为研究、模拟和缓解数字生态系统中的虚假信息传播提供了可解释的实证方法。

Abstract: Misinformation on social media thrives on surprise, emotion, and identity-driven reasoning, often amplified through human cognitive biases. To investigate these mechanisms, we model large language model (LLM) personas as synthetic agents that mimic user-level biases, ideological alignments, and trust heuristics. Within this setup, we introduce an auditor--node framework to simulate and analyze how misinformation evolves as it circulates through networks of such agents. News articles are propagated across networks of persona-conditioned LLM nodes, each rewriting received content. A question--answering-based auditor then measures factual fidelity at every step, offering interpretable, claim-level tracking of misinformation drift. We formalize a misinformation index and a misinformation propagation rate to quantify factual degradation across homogeneous and heterogeneous branches of up to 30 sequential rewrites. Experiments with 21 personas across 10 domains reveal that identity- and ideology-based personas act as misinformation accelerators, especially in politics, marketing, and technology. By contrast, expert-driven personas preserve factual stability. Controlled-random branch simulations further show that once early distortions emerge, heterogeneous persona interactions rapidly escalate misinformation to propaganda-level distortion. Our taxonomy of misinformation severity -- spanning factual errors, lies, and propaganda -- connects observed drift to established theories in misinformation studies. These findings demonstrate the dual role of LLMs as both proxies for human-like biases and as auditors capable of tracing information fidelity. The proposed framework provides an interpretable, empirically grounded approach for studying, simulating, and mitigating misinformation diffusion in digital ecosystems.
