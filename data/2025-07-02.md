### [1] [Table Understanding and (Multimodal) LLMs: A Cross-Domain Case Study on Scientific vs. Non-Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00152)
*Ekaterina Borisova,Fabio Barth,Nils Feldhus,Raia Abu Ahmad,Malte Ostendorff,Pedro Ortiz Suarez,Georg Rehm,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在处理表格数据时的表现，发现其在科学表格处理中存在挑战，但跨模态表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格是结构化数据的重要工具，但LLMs在处理表格数据方面的效率尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过跨领域和跨模态评估，比较文本和多模态LLMs在表格理解任务中的表现，并分析其上下文使用和输入相关性。

Result: LLMs在跨模态表格处理中表现稳健，但在科学表格处理中存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs在表格处理中的局限性，并提出了TableEval基准以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

### [2] [Prompting as Scientific Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00163)
*Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提示（prompting）是研究和控制大型语言模型的主要方法，也是其最强大的工具之一。本文认为提示应被视为行为科学而非玄学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示在大型语言模型研究中的科学地位，反驳将其视为玄学的观点。

Method: 通过类比将大型语言模型视为复杂生物体，提示作为行为科学的研究工具。

Result: 提示是大型语言模型科学中的关键组成部分，不应被低估。

Conclusion: 提示是研究大型语言模型的重要科学方法，应被认真对待。

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

### [3] [LineRetriever: Planning-Aware Observation Reduction for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00210)
*Imene Kerboua,Sahar Omidi Shayegan,Megh Thakkar,Xing Han Lù,Massimo Caccia,Véronique Eglin,Alexandre Aussem,Jérémy Espinas,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LineRetriever的新方法，通过语言模型识别并检索与未来导航步骤最相关的观察行，以优化网页导航任务中的自适应规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在网页导航任务中因上下文过长而丢失关键信息，导致自适应规划困难。嵌入模型缺乏捕捉规划相关信息的能力，影响了未来动作预测。

Method: 引入LineRetriever，利用语言模型识别并检索与未来导航步骤相关的观察行，优先考虑对动作预测有贡献的元素。

Result: 实验表明，LineRetriever能在减少观察内容的同时，在上下文限制内保持性能一致。

Conclusion: LineRetriever为网页导航任务中的自适应规划提供了一种有效的检索优化方法。

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

### [4] [Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00214)
*Mads Henrichsen,Rasmus Krebs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，通过利用LLM生成推理来增强文本分类，显著提升了情感分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类模型通常直接将输入映射到标签，缺乏显式推理，可能限制性能、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 微调Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型生成推理；2. 使用生成的推理增强下游生成模型的训练数据。

Result: 生成推理和情感的分类器（Q->RA）比仅生成情感的分类器（Q->A）准确率提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的推理能丰富训练数据，提升下游NLP任务性能，并提供显式解释。

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

### [5] [Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00216)
*Shreya Havaldar,Adam Stein,Eric Wong,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在风格翻译中的失败，并提出RASTA方法以改善文化差异导致的风格对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化差异常导致说话者意图与听者理解的风格不一致，LLM在翻译风格时偏向中性且非西方语言表现较差。

Method: 提出RASTA方法，利用学习到的风格概念来优化LLM翻译，使其更符合文化沟通规范。

Result: RASTA能有效改善LLM在风格翻译中的表现，尤其在非西方语言中。

Conclusion: RASTA为LLM在跨文化风格翻译中的对齐问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

### [6] [Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00239)
*Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使经过指令调优和强化学习对齐的语言模型，仍可通过线性探针解码其隐藏状态中的有害信息，表明这些信息并未被完全消除或转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令调优的语言模型是否真正消除了有害信息，或仅抑制了其直接表达。

Method: 使用线性探针训练在语言模型的隐藏状态上，解码被拒绝的有害信息。

Result: 线性探针能高精度预测被拒绝的信息（如国家平均IQ），且基模型探针可迁移至指令调优模型。

Conclusion: 指令调优并未完全消除有害信息，这些信息仍线性可解码且间接影响模型行为。

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

### [7] [The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00244)
*Isabella Senturia,Matilde Marcolli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数学模型的形态学-句法接口理论，结合Merge和强极简论题，通过代数操作描述形态句法树的形成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是为了在数学框架下形式化形态学与句法学的接口问题，特别是如何通过代数结构（如magma和operad）描述形态句法树的生成。

Method: 方法包括将形态学组织为形态树的magma，并通过operad代数对应关系将形态学与句法学数据配对，同时引入形态学余积分解。

Result: 结果表明，形态句法树的形成可以通过operad对应关系和形态学余积来描述，并重新解释了分布式形态学中的某些操作。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的数学模型能够灵活处理形态学与句法学的边界，为形态句法接口提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

### [8] [EfficientXLang: Towards Improving Token Efficiency Through Cross-Lingual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00246)
*Sanchit Ahuja,Praneetha Vaddamanu,Barun Patra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，非英语语言在语言推理模型中更高效，能减少token使用并保持准确性，且效果与模型的多语言能力相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨英语是否为最高效的语言推理语言，并研究多语言推理的潜力。

Method: 评估三种开源RLM（DeepSeek R1、Qwen 2.5、Qwen 3）在四种数学数据集和七种语言中的表现。

Result: 非英语语言推理更高效，且准确性不受影响；效果与模型的多语言能力相关。

Conclusion: 多语言推理具有潜力，强调了强大多语言基础的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

### [9] [Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00258)
*Jie Hou,Chuxiong Wu,Lannan Luo,Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）微调中的隐私风险，比较了参数微调和提示微调对成员推理攻击（MIAs）的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练大语言模型能力的提升，微调方法多样化，但微调过程中的记忆化隐私风险未得到足够关注。

Method: 分类流行微调方法，通过成员推理攻击（MIAs）评估其对记忆化的影响。

Result: 提示微调在性能上与参数微调相当，但对MIAs的脆弱性更低，且不受模型规模影响。

Conclusion: 参数微调更易泄露隐私信息，提示微调是更隐私保护的选项。

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

### [10] [Natural language processing for African languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00297)
*David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了低资源语言（尤其是撒哈拉以南非洲语言）在NLP中的挑战，提出通过高质量语料库和预训练语言模型提升语义表示，并开发了21种非洲语言的标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在NLP研究中数据稀缺、噪声多和评估困难的问题，尤其是非洲语言的代表性不足。

Method: 分析公开语料库的噪声，构建高质量语料库；研究预训练语言模型在低资源语言中的应用；开发21种非洲语言的标注数据集。

Result: 证明了数据质量对语义表示的重要性，展示了预训练语言模型在低资源语言中的潜力，并提供了大规模标注数据集。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据和预训练语言模型，可以有效提升低资源语言的NLP性能，填补了非洲语言研究的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

### [11] [Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00322)
*Daking Rai,Samuel Miller,Kevin Moran,Ziyu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在生成平衡括号等简单语法任务上表现不佳，研究发现错误源于部分不可靠机制。RASteer方法通过增强可靠机制显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在简单语法任务上表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 分析模型组件（注意力头和FF神经元）的作用，开发RASteer方法增强可靠机制。

Result: RASteer显著提升平衡括号任务的准确率（0%到100%），并在算术推理任务中取得20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过识别和增强可靠机制，可以有效提升语言模型在特定任务上的表现，且不影响其通用能力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

### [12] [Modeling Data Diversity for Joint Instance and Verbalizer Selection in Cold-Start Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00330)
*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT是一种联合选择verbalizer和实例的方法，通过建模数据多样性，优化不确定性和多样性，提升冷启动场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对模板、verbalizer和实例选择敏感，且忽略了实例与verbalizer之间的依赖关系。

Method: 将PLM词汇和$h_{[MASK]}$嵌入映射到共享空间，进行降维和聚类，以优化选择。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COLDSELECT在减少不确定性和提升泛化能力上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COLDSELECT在冷启动场景中有效提升了verbalizer和实例选择的性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

### [13] [Question Decomposition for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00355)
*Paul J. L. Ammann,Jonas Golde,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的RAG方法，通过问题分解和重排序解决多跳问题的检索不足问题，显著提升了检索和答案生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG在多跳问题（如需要从多个文档中获取信息的问题）中表现不佳，因为相关事实分散在不同文档中。

Method: 提出一种RAG流程：1) 用LLM分解原始问题为子问题；2) 为每个子问题检索相关段落；3) 合并候选池并重排序以提高证据覆盖率和精度。

Result: 在MultiHop-RAG和HotpotQA上，检索效果（MRR@10）提升36.7%，答案准确率（F1）提升11.6%。

Conclusion: 问题分解与重排序结合是解决多跳问题的有效方法，无需额外训练或专用索引即可显著提升RAG性能。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

*Vojtěch Lanz,Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了格里高利圣歌的旋律分段理论（centonisation），通过无监督分层语言模型寻找最优分段，发现其在调式分类中表现优异，但结果与传统centonisation理论不符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究格里高利圣歌旋律的分段理论（centonisation）是否成立，并探索记忆效率与调式分类的关系。

Method: 使用嵌套分层Pitman-Yor语言模型进行无监督分段，模拟僧侣记忆过程。

Result: 最优分段在调式分类中表现优异，但与传统centonisation理论不符；旋律开头和结尾更具公式化特征。

Conclusion: 记忆优化的分段与传统centonisation理论不同，表明后者可能并非格里高利圣歌旋律构造的核心机制。

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

TL;DR: CAPITAL是一种因果提示框架，通过将前门调整融入CoT推理，解决了基于提示的ISA方法中的因果有效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的ISA方法依赖多数投票，未评估因果有效性，易受内部偏见和虚假相关影响。

Method: CAPITAL将总体因果效应分解为两部分：输入提示对推理链的影响和推理链对输出的影响，采用编码器聚类和NWGM近似估计，结合对比学习目标。

Result: 在基准ISA数据集上，CAPITAL在准确性和鲁棒性上优于基线方法，尤其在对抗条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: CAPITAL为LLM提示提供了因果推理的集成方法，强调了其在偏见感知情感推理中的优势。

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are
available at: https://github.com/whZ62/CAPITAL.

Motivation: 准确预测不同人群对主观问题的回答具有重要价值。

Method: 使用相对简单的监督方法，评估多个语言模型和提示策略。

Result: 显著提升语言模型与多样人群的对齐能力，提供实用指南和基准。

Conclusion: 方法简单通用，易于采用，为未来研究提供有用参考。

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

TL;DR: 研究发现开放大语言模型基准测试存在漏洞，通过微调小型模型在公开测试集上作弊，揭示了开放基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开放基准测试（如HELM和BIG-bench）的潜在缺陷，揭示其可能被滥用的风险。

Method: 通过微调BART、T5和GPT-2的小型变体，直接在公开测试集上训练，构建“作弊”模型。

Result: 这些作弊模型在HELM基准上排名靠前，但泛化能力差且实用性有限。

Conclusion: 需结合私有或动态基准测试，并重新评估现有基准实践，以确保语言模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Motivation: 生成式搜索系统模糊了信息与广告的界限，影响透明度和信任，需解决广告插入的挑战。

Method: 采用广告重写器和分类器，利用合成数据训练分类器，并通过监督微调和最佳候选选择优化广告插入。

Result: 分类器在检测广告方面表现优异，优化策略显著提升了广告的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究为生成式搜索系统提供了广告管理框架，提升了广告插入的隐蔽性和用户体验。

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Motivation: 现有持续学习研究多依赖模拟数据，缺乏真实世界的动态性和多样性，Nirantar旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用自然收集的3250小时语音数据（含1720小时新数据），评估语言增量（LIL）、领域增量（DIL）及新型LIDIL场景。

Result: 现有方法在动态、非均匀的语言和领域变化中表现不一致，无单一方法始终优异。

Conclusion: Nirantar为持续学习研究提供了真实测试平台，凸显了对更鲁棒方法的需求。

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂语义条件下的意图识别提供了一种新的结构化建模方法，验证了其稳定性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for
computationally intensive research approaches to theory development. However,
the opacity of these algorithms and lack of transparency and rigour in their
application pose methodological challenges, potentially undermining trust in
research. The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research
is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally
intensive theory construction research.

achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in
eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages
beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination

Method: 引入知识对齐损失和软提示调优，结合轻量级适配模块，采用冻结策略和提示注入以降低计算成本。

Result: 在跨语言任务（如MLQA、XQuAD和PAWS-X）中表现优于现有方法，尤其在数据稀缺条件下优势显著。

Conclusion: 该方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，既能增强任务适应性，又能保留大语言模型的通用能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

Conclusion: MoR无需任务特定提示，为多样化任务提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting
and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need
for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust
reasoning across diverse tasks.

Result: 实验表明SAFER能精准调整安全对齐，且不影响通用聊天性能。

Conclusion: SAFER为高风险LLM对齐任务提供了奖励模型的解释、审计和优化方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper

Motivation: 探讨不同语言训练的VLMs是否反映文化背景下的注意力差异（东亚整体性 vs. 西方分析性）。

Method: 通过对比分析日语和英语训练的VLMs生成的图像描述，研究其注意力模式。

Result: VLMs不仅内化了语言结构，还再现了训练数据中的文化行为，表明文化认知可能隐式影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 文化认知对VLMs的输出有潜在影响，模型可能隐式学习并反映文化行为。

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate

Method: 引入LitBench，包含人类标注的故事比较数据集，并训练Bradley-Terry和生成式奖励模型进行验证。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet是表现最佳的零样本评估模型（73%一致性），训练后的奖励模型达到78%准确性。

Conclusion: LitBench为创意写作系统的自动化评估和优化提供了可靠资源。

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

Conclusion: 建议系统比较不同GenAI模型在特定任务中的表现，并强调实证研究和理论反思的重要性。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Conclusion: LLM群体的表面行为类似人类，但驱动机制不同，这对AI对齐和多智能体设计提出了新问题。

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过风格计量学方法区分LLM生成文本与人类文本，涉及模型归属、知识产权和AI伦理问题，使用多种特征和分类模型，取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成文本的归属问题，保护知识产权，促进AI伦理使用。

Method: 构建基准数据集，应用风格计量学特征（词汇、语法、句法、标点），使用树模型分类。

Result: 多分类场景下MCC达0.87，二分类准确率0.79-1.0，Wikipedia与GPT-4区分准确率达0.98。

Conclusion: 风格计量学可有效区分LLM与人类文本，尤其在特定文本类型中表现优异。

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransLaw是一个基于多智能体框架的香港法律判决翻译系统，通过Translator、Annotator和Proofreader三个智能体协作，显著提升翻译准确性、风格适应性和结构连贯性，成本远低于人工翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLMs）在香港法律判决翻译中的潜力，解决法律术语复杂、文化嵌入细微差别和严格语言结构等挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体框架TransLaw，包含Translator、Annotator和Proofreader三个智能体，支持可定制的LLM配置。

Result: TransLaw在13种开源和商业LLM上测试，表现优于GPT-4o，但在复杂术语和风格自然度上仍不及人类专家。

Conclusion: TransLaw为法律翻译提供了一种高效且经济的解决方案，但在某些方面仍需进一步优化以接近人类专家水平。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.
Our platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus
used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 研究发现，数学问题的文化背景会影响语言模型的性能，尤其是在非西方文化场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数学问题的文化背景对语言模型性能的影响，填补现有基准（如GSM8K）的文化局限性。

Method: 通过提示转换和人工验证，为五个地区（非洲、印度、中国、韩国、日本）创建文化适配的GSM8K测试集，并评估六种大型语言模型在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型在原始美国中心数据集上表现最佳，在文化适配版本上表现较差，但具备推理能力的模型对文化差异更具韧性。

Conclusion: 深层推理能力有助于缓解数学任务中文化背景差异带来的性能差距。

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

TL;DR: 研究发现，下游任务性能与预训练损失的线性缩放关系仅占少数情况（39%），且实验设置的微小变化可能完全改变缩放趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨下游缩放定律是否能预测任务性能，以及线性缩放趋势的普遍性。

Method: 对现有下游缩放定律数据进行元分析。

Result: 仅39%的情况下符合线性缩放趋势，实验设置的微小变化会显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 需深入理解缩放定律成功的条件，并接受非线性缩放行为的存在。

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue
dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale,
MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何利用复杂模型和机器学习技术处理同源词数据，但当前手动收集的数据规模不足，且缺乏自动生成大规模数据集的方法。

Method: 通过从BabelNet（大型多语言百科全书词典）中自动提取数据集，生成字符矩阵，并基于此进行系统发育推断。

Result: 结果显示，基于自动提取数据集的系统发育树与公认的黄金标准树存在显著不一致，且从其他多语言资源中提取更合适的字符矩阵的可能性较低。

Conclusion: 结论指出，当前无法为同源词数据应用需要大规模数据集的系统发育分析方法，如何（或是否）能在历史语言学中应用这些计算方法仍是一个开放问题。

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

Method: 分析微调语料库中的话语结构，揭示启发式捷径的存在，并提出利用精选数据集的启发式改进方法。

Result: 发现道德自我修正依赖启发式捷径，导致自我修正与自我诊断能力提升时的不一致性。

Conclusion: 提出利用启发式数据集改进道德自我修正，并指出其在情境学习和模型规模上的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Motivation: 研究CLM和MLM在文本表示任务中的优劣，明确其性能差异是否源于目标函数本身或其他因素。

Method: 通过大规模实验（30个模型，15,000次微调评估）对比CLM和MLM的表现，并提出双阶段训练策略。

Result: MLM在多数任务中表现更好，但CLM更高效且稳定；双阶段训练策略在固定计算预算下表现最优。

Conclusion: 双阶段训练策略（先CLM后MLM）能有效提升文本表示性能，尤其适合从现有CLM模型初始化的情况。

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频中表现不佳，帧子采样常丢失关键帧或包含冗余信息，影响模型准确性和效率。

Method: 使用轻量级时刻检索模型优先选择与问题最相关的帧，优化帧采样过程。

Result: 在四个长视频问答数据集和四种先进视频大语言模型上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: “moment sampling”显著提升了长视频问答的性能，是一种模型无关的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 动态交通环境（如昼夜变化）中，模型在适应新数据分布时会遗忘旧知识，现有方法无法高效利用历史数据。

Method: 提出ER-EMU算法，结合FIFO经验缓冲区和基于域距离度量的经验选择（DDM-ES），优先选择与当前目标域差异大的历史数据。

Result: 在Bellevue交通视频数据集上，ER-EMU显著提升了多种云边协同目标检测框架的性能。

Conclusion: ER-EMU通过自适应经验回放有效缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于动态环境中的模型持续学习。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

Motivation: MRI图像对比识别依赖DICOM元数据，但现有数据常不完整、噪声多或不一致，且常用标签（如T1/T2加权）过于粗略。这影响了图像解释、检索及临床应用。

Method: 提出MR-CLIP框架，通过对比学习对齐MRI图像与DICOM元数据，学习对比感知表示。训练数据涵盖多种扫描仪和协议。

Conclusion: MR-CLIP为MRI图像对比识别提供了可扩展的解决方案，具有进一步临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种检测全切片图像（WSI）中伪影的方法，并比较了它们的性能，其中基于基础模型的方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI在癌症诊断中广泛应用，但伪影会影响图像分析质量，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 比较了三种方法：基于基础模型的FMA、基于ResNet50的DLA和基于手工特征的KBA，针对六种常见伪影类型。

Result: FMA的AUROC最高（0.995），优于DLA（0.977）和KBA（0.940）。

Conclusion: FMA是检测WSI伪影的最有效方法，并开发了质量报告工具以辅助诊断。

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在简单任务上表现优异，但在复杂情境（如侦探级推理）中表现不佳，需要更难的测试任务。

Method: 通过实验分析MLLMs在CaughtCheating任务中的表现，探究其失败原因。

Result: 发现MLLMs在CaughtCheating任务中表现接近零，揭示了其在复杂视觉推理中的不足。

Conclusion: CaughtCheating为MLLMs提供了具有实际价值的挑战性任务，成功解决将推动其达到人类级推理能力。

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

*Akshansh Mishra,Eyob Mesele Sefene,Shivraman Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化计算的图像分割方法，用于分析增材摩擦搅拌沉积（AFSD）过程中的完整性。采用粒子群优化（PSO）确定最佳分割阈值，结合梯度幅度分析和距离变换生成注意力加权可视化，揭示传统成像难以观察到的缺陷区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像方法难以捕捉AFSD多层构建中的细微缺陷和材料过渡区域，因此需要一种更精确的自动化分析方法。

Method: 结合PSO算法、梯度幅度分析和距离变换，生成注意力加权和多通道可视化技术，以检测材料界面和缺陷。

Result: PSO自动确定了最佳阈值（156-173），多通道可视化技术成功量化了界面质量，并识别出未完全结合和材料不均匀的区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为AFSD工艺优化和质量评估提供了定量指标，显著提升了缺陷检测能力。

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据集训练中的计算负担和冗余问题，现有方法在任务无关性或计算成本上存在局限。

Method: AdaDeDup通过密度剪枝和代理模型反馈，自适应调整剪枝阈值，优化数据子集选择。

Result: 在多个大规模目标检测基准上，AdaDeDup显著优于基线方法，减少性能下降，同时剪枝20%数据。

Conclusion: AdaDeDup有效提升数据效率，适用于大规模模型训练，代码已开源。

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗VLM在临床应用中潜力巨大，但缺乏系统性的安全性评估，因此需要一种标准化方法来量化其漏洞。

Method: VSF--Med包含三个新组件：文本提示攻击模板库、基于SSIM的视觉扰动校准和由两个LLM评估的八维评分标准。

Result: 在30,000个对抗样本测试中，VSF--Med显示主流VLM在攻击效果持续性、提示注入有效性和安全性绕过方面均存在显著漏洞。

Conclusion: VSF--Med为医疗VLM的安全性评估提供了可复现的基准工具，揭示了现有模型的潜在风险。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

TL;DR: MANTA是一个多模态学习框架，通过文本对齐统一视觉和听觉输入，解决了语义对齐、时间同步、多尺度表示和稀疏信息检索等挑战，显著提升了长视频问答和跨模态理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法通常将不同模态分开处理，导致表示和推理的不一致性。MANTA旨在通过统一的文本空间解决这一问题。

Method: MANTA采用信息论优化实现跨模态语义对齐，自适应时间同步，分层内容表示和上下文感知稀疏信息检索，并通过数学框架证明其最优性。

Result: 在长视频问答任务中，MANTA将最先进模型的准确率提高了22.6%，在超过30分钟的视频上提升27.3%，在时间推理和跨模态理解任务中分别提升23.8%和25.1%。

Conclusion: MANTA通过新颖的密度估计技术最小化冗余并保留稀有信号，为多模态表示的文本统一奠定了基础。

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

Motivation: 学习型感知算法在分布外和代表性不足的环境中性能下降，尤其是户外机器人因光照、季节和天气变化导致训练数据不足。本文旨在为自动驾驶车辆在雪地环境中的部署做准备。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的图像增强方法，利用公开的视觉基础模型生成更接近部署环境的训练数据，并通过开放词汇语义分割模型过滤幻觉增强候选。

Result: 该方法能够控制训练数据中地面语义分布，并针对部署环境微调模型。

Conclusion: 扩散模型图像增强方法可扩展至雪地以外的其他环境，如沙地和火山地形。

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

Conclusion: FreeLong和FreeLong++为解决长视频生成中的高频失真问题提供了有效方案，且兼容现有模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

Result: 高分辨率输入提升检测精度，SelvaBox训练的模型在零样本检测中表现优异。

Conclusion: SelvaBox为热带树冠检测提供了重要资源，其公开数据集和模型推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

Conclusion: 该图神经网络方法在植物组件识别任务中表现出色，为精准农业提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our
graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for
identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the
IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

Conclusion: FiboSB数据集和改进方法为协作场景中的6D姿态估计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上验证，VOCAL表现出更高的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: VOCAL推动了VO向更通用和可解释的空间智能发展。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly

Result: 系统能自我对抗、与真实击剑手动作对抗，并与专业击剑手互动对抗。

Conclusion: VirtualFencer展示了数据驱动建模在击剑运动中的潜力。

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

Conclusion: 该流程高效、低延迟，适用于实时和数据稀缺环境，为旅行者提供更好的房产信息理解。

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督方法，通过生成多视图X射线对应矩阵，提升多视图骨折检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在多视图X射线对应关系上表现不足，影响临床诊断准确性。

Method: 利用未标注CT体积生成数字重建X射线（DRR），通过基于Transformer的训练预测多视图对应关系。

Result: 在合成和真实X射线数据上验证，多视图对应关系提升了骨折分类性能。

Conclusion: 自监督方法可有效提升多视图X射线分析的准确性，无需人工标注。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）分类面临深度学习的挑战，MIL方法虽适用但性能波动大，影响可靠性和可重复性。

Method: 采用多保真度模型融合策略，先训练多个模型并基于验证分数平均稳定且有潜力的模型。

Result: 在2个数据集、3种初始化策略和5种MIL方法上进行了2000多次实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著减少性能波动，简化超参数调优，提高可重复性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

TL;DR: SR-LoRA利用预训练权重矩阵的稳定秩作为层间秩分配的先验，提升低秩自适应（LoRA）在领域差异大的任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定低秩结构限制了LoRA在领域差异大的任务中的适应性，现有方法依赖计算密集型技术。

Method: 提出SR-LoRA框架，利用稳定秩指导层间秩分配，无需额外搜索成本。

Result: 在领域差异大的少样本任务中，SR-LoRA表现优于现有自适应LoRA变体。

Conclusion: SR-LoRA在性能和效率之间实现了更优的平衡。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven effective in reducing computational
costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully fine-tuned foundation
models across various tasks. However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts
its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks
are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive
LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or
selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on
computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,
or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable
Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the
stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise
rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic
dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient
redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring
additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with
significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent
adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring
breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated
lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker,
a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization
across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy
incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score
refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification
cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion
pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in
mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455
average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%,
highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

Abstract: Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator?
We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by
teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and
a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person
into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization,
and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video
generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a
single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body
poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can
uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without
labeled affordance datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据缺乏多摄像头共享场景的上下文信息，无法满足复杂场景中模态分割和内容补全的需求。

Result: 数据集包含约580万物体实例，是目前最大的模态分割数据集，并首次提供真实模态内容标注。

Conclusion: MOVi-MC-AC为计算机视觉领域提供了新的多摄像头视角和模态内容补全基准。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Method: 提出CGEarthEye框架，包含多规模骨干网络；构建JLSSD数据集，采用多级表示聚类和采样策略；集成季节性对比、增强对比和掩码补丁标记对比策略进行预训练。

Conclusion: CGEarthEye的卓越表征能力将促进吉林一号数据在传统地球观测应用中的更广泛和高效使用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

Motivation: 3DGS因其显式3D高斯表示而流行，但依赖精确初始化，且缺乏有效的密度控制机制。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 几何引导的初始化预测高斯参数；2. 表面对齐优化策略；3. 动态自适应密度控制机制。

Result: 方法在复杂场景中实现了高保真实时渲染，视觉质量显著提升，优于或媲美现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过几何引导初始化、表面对齐优化和动态密度控制，显著提升了3DGS的性能和视觉质量。

Abstract: We propose a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{Kerbl2023},
addressing challenges in initialization, optimization, and density control.
Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while
supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its
explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate
initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian
distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control
mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided
initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and
faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy
to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with
the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive
density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional
complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve
high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual
quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior
results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real
time.

Motivation: 手写签名在身份识别中具有重要作用，但样本中常含干扰信息，影响识别准确性。

Method: 采用改进的U-net结构，结合离散小波变换和PCA变换，提升去噪效果。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在去噪效果上显著优于传统方法，提高了签名图像的清晰度和可读性。

Conclusion: 该模型为签名分析与识别提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are
widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial
contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In
forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures
requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which
are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.
However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount
of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting
identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising
model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness
of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform
and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The
experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the
traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity
and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical
support for signature analysis and recognition.

Motivation: 神经网络对分布外（OOD）样本的预测往往过于自信，因此OOD检测对提升机器学习安全性至关重要。

Method: 提出ATLI方法，自适应确定模型特有的有效top-k logits，并将最大logit与其他top-k logits结合。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中，ATLI将假阳性率（FPR95）比MaxLogit降低了6.73%，比其他先进方法进一步降低了2.67%。

Conclusion: ATLI方法在OOD检测中表现出色，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Neural networks often make overconfident predictions from out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples. Detection of OOD data is therefore crucial to improve the safety
of machine learning. The simplest and most powerful method for OOD detection is
MaxLogit, which uses the model's maximum logit to provide an OOD score. We have
discovered that, in addition to the maximum logit, some other logits are also
useful for OOD detection. Based on this finding, we propose a new method called
ATLI (Adaptive Top-k Logits Integration), which adaptively determines effective
top-k logits that are specific to each model and combines the maximum logit
with the other top-k logits. In this study we evaluate our proposed method
using ImageNet-1K benchmark. Extensive experiments showed our proposed method
to reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by 6.73% compared to the MaxLogit
approach, and decreased FPR95 by an additional 2.67% compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PlantSegNeRF为植物器官级表型分析提供了高通量方法，并为植物科学大规模模型开发提供了高质量3D数据。

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the
high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits.
Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on
segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ
segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and
generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a
novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),
aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from
multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF
performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate
instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance
IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a
specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to
render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance
information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision
plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved
that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the
commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,
17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the
second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly,
PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance
segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements
of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively.
This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a
high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of
large-scale models in plant science.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在解决浅景深模糊问题上具有高效性和可扩展性，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of
field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This
limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those
used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to
form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and
defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained
on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well
in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world
data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially
varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the
scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes
effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

Motivation: 现有ROI图像压缩方法预定义ROI且无法调整，无法满足多样化的用户需求。

Method: 开发了文本控制掩码获取模块（TMA）、可定制值分配机制（CVA）和潜在掩码注意力模块（LMA）。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效支持ROI定制和质量权衡管理。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了ROI定义和质量权衡的定制需求。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often
limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models
provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their
effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on
large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address
these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image
generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce
medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a
data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask
enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a
lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical
randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol
filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask
corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation
datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's
segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework
effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation. The

### [77] [Learning Dense Feature Matching via Lifting Single 2D Image to 3D Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00392)
*Yingping Liang,Yutao Hu,Wenqi Shao,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lift to Match (L2M)的两阶段框架，通过将2D图像提升到3D空间，利用单视图图像实现鲁棒的特征匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征匹配方法依赖多视图图像且泛化能力有限，传统特征编码器仅基于单视图2D图像训练，无法捕捉3D感知的对应关系。

Method: 第一阶段通过多视图图像合成和3D特征高斯表示学习3D感知特征编码器；第二阶段结合新视图渲染和大规模合成数据训练特征解码器。

Result: 在零样本评估基准上表现出优异的泛化能力，验证了框架的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: L2M框架通过3D几何知识注入和大规模数据合成，显著提升了特征匹配的泛化能力。

Abstract: Feature matching plays a fundamental role in many computer vision tasks, yet
existing methods heavily rely on scarce and clean multi-view image collections,
which constrains their generalization to diverse and challenging scenarios.
Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D
images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space,
named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and
diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a
3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and
3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into
the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined
with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed
to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving
generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation
benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust
feature matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIV-head的新方法，用于解决在无法微调骨干网络的情况下进行跨域小样本学习的问题，其性能优于现有方法且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中，微调骨干网络（特征提取器）通常不可行或不可能，导致生成的嵌入质量低且静态。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将小样本分类问题转化为多实例验证（MIV）任务，并提出MIV-head方法，该方法不依赖预训练骨干网络且计算高效。

Result: 在跨域小样本图像分类任务中，MIV-head性能优于部分微调方法，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MIV-head是一种高效且性能优越的小样本域适应方法，适用于无法微调骨干网络的场景。

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D修复方法在处理多视图时存在单视图不鲁棒、外观和几何不一致的问题，需要一种统一的框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: DiGA3D采用多视图参考选择策略、注意力特征传播机制（AFP）和纹理-几何评分蒸馏采样（TG-SDS）损失，从粗到细实现一致的3D修复。

Result: 实验表明，DiGA3D在多种3D修复任务中表现优异，显著提升了外观和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DiGA3D为3D修复提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案，适用于多种任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing a unified pipeline that enables users to remove, re-texture, or
replace objects in a versatile manner is crucial for text-guided 3D inpainting.
However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks
within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack
robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2)
Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images
with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when
there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and
geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy
for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation.
Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that
propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views
via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D
introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to
further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes. Extensive
experiments on multiple 3D inpainting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. The project page is available at https://rorisis.github.io/DiGA3D/.

Motivation: 解决手写数学表达式识别中因复杂结构和字符布局导致的序列预测问题。

Method: 提出MFH方法，将频域信息与HMER结合，利用DCT进行结构分析。

Result: 在CROHME 2014/2016/2019测试集上分别达到61.66%/62.07%/63.72%的准确率。

Conclusion: 频域信息能有效提升HMER性能，MFH方法具有显著效果。

Abstract: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) suffers from complex
formula structures and character layouts in sequence prediction. In this paper,
we incorporate frequency domain analysis into HMER and propose a method that
marries frequency domain with HMER (MFH), leveraging the discrete cosine
transform (DCT). We emphasize the structural analysis assistance of frequency
information for recognizing mathematical formulas. When implemented on various
baseline models, our network exhibits a consistent performance enhancement,
demonstrating the efficacy of frequency domain information. Experiments show
that our MFH-CoMER achieves noteworthy accuracyrates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on
the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 test sets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: Latent-PMRF将PMRF方法改进为在VAE的潜在空间中操作，以更好地匹配人类感知，同时显著提升收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PMRF方法在像素空间中建模，难以与人类感知对齐，因此需要改进。

Method: 在VAE的潜在空间中重新定义PMRF，利用潜在表示的最小失真估计，并通过VAE的重构误差限制失真。

Result: Latent-PMRF在盲脸恢复任务中表现优异，PD权衡优于现有方法，收敛速度提升5.79倍。

Conclusion: Latent-PMRF通过潜在空间建模显著提升了性能与效率，为PD权衡提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face
restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve
minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean
Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution
is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its
pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human
perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between
two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which
reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),
facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By
defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum
distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's
reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our
proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and
restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the
superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to
existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a
5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as
open-source.

### [82] [ATSTrack: Enhancing Visual-Language Tracking by Aligning Temporal and Spatial Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00454)
*Yihao Zhen,Qiang Wang,Yu Qiao,Liangqiong Qu,Huijie Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATSTrack提出了一种新的视觉语言跟踪方法，通过对齐视觉和语言输入的时间和空间尺度差异，提升特征修改效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言跟踪中，视觉输入与语言描述的对齐问题因目标运动而复杂化，现有方法未充分考虑时间和空间尺度的差异。

Method: ATSTrack将语言描述分解为具有不同属性的短语，并细粒度地修改其特征，同时引入视觉语言标记以减少空间尺度差异的影响。

Result: 实验表明，ATSTrack性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: ATSTrack通过时间和空间尺度的对齐，有效解决了视觉语言跟踪中的特征对齐问题。

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

TL;DR: MS-TTA是一种无需训练的测试时适应方法，通过kNN Mean-Shift增强CLIP的特征表示，提升分布偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖高置信度样本，忽略了低置信度样本的潜力，且局限于CLIP原始特征空间。

Method: 使用单步kNN Mean-Shift优化所有测试样本的特征表示，提高特征紧凑性和类别可分性。

Result: 在OOD和跨数据集基准测试中，MS-TTA表现优于现有训练免费TTA方法。

Conclusion: MS-TTA无需额外训练即可实现鲁棒的测试时适应。

Abstract: Visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization but
struggle with distribution shifts at test time. Existing training-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods operate strictly within CLIP's original
feature space, relying on high-confidence samples while overlooking the
potential of low-confidence ones. We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach
that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step
k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA
improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable
adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances
inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits. Extensive evaluations on OOD
and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that MS-TTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods, achieving robust adaptation without
requiring additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频是持续演化的数据流，现有视觉语言模型在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘和更新冲突的挑战。

Method: 受海马体快速绑定和模式分离机制启发，设计多方向监督模块和对比提示学习方案。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，Bisecle有效减轻遗忘并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bisecle为视频语言持续学习提供了一种高效解决方案，增强了模型的记忆保留能力。

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自回归的帧级框架ARIG，用于实时生成更具交互真实感的虚拟头部运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在信号获取、上下文行为理解和切换平滑性上的局限性，以实现更实时和真实的交互。

Method: 采用非向量量化的自回归过程建模运动预测，利用扩散过程表示运动分布，并强调交互行为理解（IBU）和对话状态理解（CSU）。

Result: 实验验证了模型的有效性，实现了更准确的连续空间预测和更高的交互真实感。

Conclusion: ARIG框架在实时生成和交互真实感方面表现优越，为虚拟代理的头部运动生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the
research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion
responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or
motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise
generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods
have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral
understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time
and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based
frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with
better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion
prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index
prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,
achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction
realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed
conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track
dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through
bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over
long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU
to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that
exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final
progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the
effectiveness of our model.

Conclusion: ADAptation框架在临床领域适应中具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to
distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains.
Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining
represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources.
Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs
while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by
distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a
novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named
ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain
data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method
first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models
to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain
style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained
contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a
dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and
representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets
(three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep
classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based
competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical
domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link:

Result: 发现当前LMMs（如GPT-4o和InternVL2.5系列）在基础视觉任务中表现显著低于人类水平，视觉与语言模块设计存在相关性。

Conclusion: LMM-JND为研究LMMs提供了新视角，其可预测性对安全至关重要，未来需优化LMMs的视觉能力。

Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual
system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work
has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a
scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across
multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly
advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted
capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual
defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential
security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an
initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots
in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new
concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting
uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,
we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named
VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12
distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where
state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle
with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level
visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language
backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that
may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,
our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective
for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形状评估方法Configural Shape Score (CSS)，用于衡量模型在保留局部纹理的同时识别全局部分排列的能力，发现高CSS模型依赖长程交互，并展示了CSS对其他形状相关任务的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代视觉模型主要依赖局部纹理线索，忽略了形状与纹理的协同作用，导致特征脆弱且非组合性。论文旨在通过CSS评估模型的绝对配置能力，探索模型如何同时利用局部和全局线索。

Method: 提出CSS作为评估指标，通过Object-Anagram对测试模型识别能力，分析86种卷积、Transformer和混合模型，并采用注意力掩码和相似性分析探究机制。

Result: 发现高CSS模型（如DINOv2、SigLIP2和EVA-CLIP）依赖长程交互，且CSS能预测其他形状相关任务表现。BagNet控制实验排除了边界策略的干扰。

Conclusion: 论文指出，构建鲁棒且类人的视觉系统需整合局部纹理与全局形状线索，而非在二者间做人为选择。

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SSM方法在局部结构重建和高维数据处理上表现不佳，Laplace-Mamba旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Laplace-Mamba在恢复质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Laplace-Mamba通过频率分解和混合架构，有效解决了图像去雾中的局部和高维数据处理问题。

Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models
(SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their
appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based
approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend
to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting
in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency
prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing.
Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into
low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components
representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized
processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs
for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to
refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.
Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving
downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,
thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency. The

TL;DR: ExPaMoE提出了一种可扩展的并行混合专家架构，通过双分支专家设计和实时频谱感知域判别器，解决了持续测试时适应中的特征纠缠和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法依赖共享模型参数，易受大或非平稳域偏移的影响，导致特征纠缠和灾难性遗忘。

Method: ExPaMoE采用双分支专家设计分离领域通用和特定知识，并通过频谱感知在线域判别器动态扩展专家池。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中（如CIFAR-10C、ImageNet-C等）表现优异，并引入ImageNet++作为新的大规模CTTA基准。

Conclusion: ExPaMoE在持续测试时适应中展现出强鲁棒性、可扩展性和抗遗忘能力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt
on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts.
However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across
all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic
forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address
this limitation, we propose \textbf{ExPaMoE}, a novel framework based on an
\emph{Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts} architecture. ExPaMoE decouples
domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design
with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool
based on a \emph{Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator} (SODD) that
detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse
CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including
CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{ImageNet++}, a large-scale and
realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to
better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE
consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability,
and resistance to forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-SP通过添加六个空间视觉标记增强视觉表示，提出新型投影器和两种变体，显著提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP-ViT在局部关系建模上的不足，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉细节理解能力。

Method: 1) 提出卷积核投影器生成空间视觉标记；2) 设计两种变体（LLaVA-SP-Cropping和LLaVA-SP-Pooling）处理不同视觉任务；3) 使用LoRA微调。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中显著优于LLaVA-1.5，推理延迟几乎相同。

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP通过简单高效的空间标记增强，显著提升了视觉表示和多模态任务性能。

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are

Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂适配器或模态特定调优，忽视跨模态交互，导致高计算成本或对齐不理想。

Method: 引入选择性视觉提示融合（SVIP）和扰动驱动一致性对齐（PDCA），动态注入视觉特征并增强跨模态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了性能与计算开销的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SCING框架简单高效，显著提升了跨模态对齐和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in adapting vision-language pre-training models like CLIP
for person re-identification (ReID) tasks often rely on complex adapter design
or modality-specific tuning while neglecting cross-modal interaction, leading
to high computational costs or suboptimal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective
Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and
robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key
innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a
lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into
text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed
Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training
strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image
perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented
cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular
benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID,
and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed
method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining
efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and
computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 肝脏标志物在腹腔镜手术中为外科医生提供关键解剖指导，但标志物的管状结构和术中动态变形对自动检测提出了挑战。

Method: 采用snake-CNN双路径编码器捕获RGB纹理和深度拓扑结构，提出边界感知拓扑融合模块（BTF）和拓扑约束损失函数。

Result: 在L3D和P2ILF数据集上表现出色，精度和计算复杂度均优。

Conclusion: TopoNet在腹腔镜肝脏手术标志物检测中具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during
laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular
structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose
significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we
introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for
laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN
dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information
and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a
boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D
features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology.
Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which
contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to
ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive
experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves
outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential
for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在真实场景中难以捕捉用户意图，且现有驾驶相关VQA数据集局限于全场景描述或路径预测，无法评估模型对局部化用户查询的响应能力。

Method: 提出Box-QAymo数据集，通过用户绘制边界框表达意图，采用层次化评估协议（从基础能力检查到属性预测、运动理解和时空推理），并辅以众包细粒度对象类别和视觉属性。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在感知问题上表现显著不足，揭示了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更鲁棒且可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实场景下的有效用户沟通。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP在多种应用中表现出色，但某些注意力头可能对最终表征产生负面影响，消融这些头可能提升性能。

Method: 提出AAT方法，通过操纵注意力权重抑制特定头的贡献，并结合两种策略适应不同应用场景。

Result: AAT在跨模态检索等任务中显著提升性能，召回率最高提升11.1%，且不增加推理成本。

Conclusion: AAT能有效优化大规模视觉语言模型，提升性能且几乎不增加计算开销。

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖低通滤波，但对采样率不敏感，导致欠滤波或过度平滑。

Result: 实验表明，LOD-GS在公共数据集和新数据集上均达到SOTA渲染质量，有效消除混叠。

Conclusion: LOD-GS通过采样率敏感滤波框架，显著提升了3D场景渲染质量，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent
challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate
aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often
resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this
limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework
for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering
strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of
basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to
model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These
basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an
end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and
camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on
down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,
overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive
assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at
varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our
newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering
quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been
open-sourced.

Result: 在NTU-60、NTU-120和PKU-MMD数据集上分别比SMIE方法提升了22.96%、12.53%和18.54%的准确率。

Conclusion: PGFA通过改进特征对齐和减少偏差，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen
skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during
training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in
generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use
two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories
using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text
features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text
alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is
hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed
skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective
skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and
unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided
feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,
termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive
training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient
discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a
prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact
of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and
empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared
with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy
improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD
datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: OOD检测是发展可靠、安全、鲁棒AI系统的关键，为研究者提供了清晰的导航和研究机会。

Abstract: The ability to detect objects that are not prevalent in the training set is a
critical capability in many 3D applications, including autonomous driving.
Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object
categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes
present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real
world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely
ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate
significantly from the training distribution. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of OOD detection within the broader scope of trustworthy
and uncertain AI. We begin with key use cases across diverse domains, introduce
benchmark datasets spanning multiple modalities, and discuss evaluation
metrics. Next, we present a comparative analysis of OOD detection
methodologies, exploring model structures, uncertainty indicators, and
distributional distance taxonomies, alongside uncertainty calibration
techniques. Finally, we highlight promising research directions, including
adversarially robust OOD detection and failure identification, particularly
relevant to 3D applications. The paper offers both theoretical and practical
insights into OOD detection, showcasing emerging research opportunities such as
3D vision integration. These insights help new researchers navigate the field
more effectively, contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and robust
AI systems.

Conclusion: ReStraV为AI生成视频检测提供了基于神经表示几何的新视角，是一种低成本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: Sim-MPNet通过记忆相似性先验和动态更新策略，有效提升医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

Abstract: Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students'
engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper
addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through
facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant
progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions,
academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity
of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel
dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140
students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,
laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual
study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators
using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,
enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the
first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that
annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking
at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER
(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes
learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively
integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results
demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed
for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately
recognizing academic emotions. Project page: https://zgsfer.github.io/CAER

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from
raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to
extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing
an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,
end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present
World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision
foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating
multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts
scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations
enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It
then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene
features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future
states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector

### [104] [De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels to Enhancing Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00608)
*Zehua Fu,Chenguang Liu,Yuyu Chen,Jiaqi Zhou,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DeSimPL方法，通过减少训练中简单样本的比例，提升自标记检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自标记检测器因简单样本比例高（简单标签偏差）而性能不及域对齐方法的问题。

Method: 提出DeSimPL，利用实例级记忆库更新伪标签，引入对抗样本增加复杂样本比例，并使用自适应加权损失避免后期训练中的假阳性伪标签。

Result: 实验表明DeSimPL显著减少简单样本比例，提升自标记检测器性能。

Conclusion: DeSimPL有效解决了自标记检测器的性能瓶颈，验证了简单标签偏差的影响。

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

TL;DR: UMDATrack提出了一种统一的域适应框架，能够在多种恶劣天气条件下保持高质量的目标状态预测，通过可控场景生成器和域定制适配器实现快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉目标跟踪方法在白天数据上表现良好，但在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，UMDATrack旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用可控场景生成器合成少量多天气条件下的未标记视频，设计域定制适配器（DCA）和目标感知置信对齐模块（TCA）。

Result: UMDATrack显著超越现有先进视觉跟踪器，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: UMDATrack通过统一的域适应框架，有效解决了恶劣天气条件下的目标跟踪问题。

Abstract: Visual object tracking has gained promising progress in past decades. Most of
the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in
well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios
with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the
tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this
paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality
target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a
unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable
scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than
2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the
guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet
effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects'
representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant
model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between
source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment
module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and
lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Z-Z188/UMDATrack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低细节城市模型（LoD1）的空中视觉定位新方法LoD-Loc v2，通过粗到细的策略实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖高细节模型（LoD2/LoD3），但全球多数可用或规划中的城市模型为低细节（LoD1），限制了无人机在全球城市定位中的应用。

Method: LoD-Loc v2采用建筑分割网络提取轮廓，通过粗姿态选择和细姿态估计（粒子滤波）实现定位。

Result: 实验表明，LoD-Loc v2在高细节模型上提升精度，首次实现低细节模型定位，并大幅超越现有方法。

Conclusion: LoD-Loc v2扩展了定位模型的适用范围，提升了鲁棒性，推动了相关研究发展。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low
Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method
LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.
However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the
majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct
nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD
city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To
address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization
over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc
v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.
Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by
uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose
probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of
alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose
with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a
particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used
to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose
estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two
datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries
and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2
improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with
low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and
broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

Abstract: Accepted in the ICIP 2025
  We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that
addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and
stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose
Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion
continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to
high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction
data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large,
diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations
transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability,
and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other
human-motion applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LVLM在多模态任务中的幻觉问题，避免多查询导致的响应延迟。

Method: 使用文本到视觉熵比选择性增强关键文本信息，仅需单次查询和单层干预。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且实现简单、计算成本低。

Conclusion: ONLY为LVLM的实时应用提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

TL;DR: CageAttack提出了一种基于笼形变形的对抗攻击框架，通过结构化变形生成自然的对抗点云，平衡了可转移性、不可防御性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在点云上施加严格的几何约束，限制了可转移性和不可防御性；而现有非结构化变形方法可能导致不自然的扭曲。

Method: 构建目标对象的笼形结构，通过对笼顶点施加扰动实现平滑变形，确保变形自然且合理。

Result: 在三个数据集的七种3D深度神经网络分类器上，CageAttack在可转移性、不可防御性和合理性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CageAttack通过结构化变形实现了更自然的对抗点云生成，显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints
to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit
transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative,
existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making
adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In
this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that
produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around
the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking
deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which
seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting
deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility.
Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three
datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among
transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然复杂度低，但性能显著低于标准Softmax Attention，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析线性注意力的公式，发现其忽略了查询的幅度信息，提出MALA方法，改进线性注意力的计算方式。

Result: MALA在多项任务（如图像分类、目标检测等）中表现优异，性能接近Softmax Attention。

Conclusion: MALA通过引入查询的幅度信息，显著提升了线性注意力的性能，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多将多视角图像生成视为2D任务，缺乏显式3D建模，而结构化表示对自动驾驶场景生成至关重要。

Method: BEV-VAE首先训练多视角图像变分自编码器以构建紧凑的BEV潜在空间，随后通过潜在扩散变换器生成场景，支持任意视角生成和可选3D布局。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，BEV-VAE在3D一致性重建和生成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: BEV-VAE通过结构化表示和多视角潜在空间建模，为自动驾驶场景生成提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene
understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as
a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue
that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially
for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent
and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image
variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then
generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports
arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D
layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance
in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有方法在一致的位置嵌入和时序多属性学习方面存在局限性，影响了道路网络的准确重建。

Method: TopoStreamer引入了流式属性约束、动态车道边界位置编码和车道段去噪三项关键改进。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，TopoStreamer在车道段感知任务中mAP提升了3.4%，在中心线感知任务中OLS提升了2.1%。

Conclusion: TopoStreamer通过时序一致性和多样性学习，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的准确性。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Result: 在九个基准数据集上的实验表明，UPRE在ZSDA检测场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: UPRE通过优化提示和视觉表示，显著提升了零样本域适应的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the
lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their
zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address
domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection
task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement
(UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual
representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain
prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific
knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain
style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies,
including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which
align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual
representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验验证了该方法能同时检测多种模型窃取攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了微调模型的所有权验证问题，提升了防御的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型在多图像任务中的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding
in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance
degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image
compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in
cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the
reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach
begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for
cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to
identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using
the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL
to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\%
improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain
reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach
exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\%
and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks,
respectively.

Conclusion: MMGCN通过多模态融合和数据增强，显著提升了动作分割的准确性和时间一致性。

Abstract: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging
the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a
fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between
text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct
fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from
unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the
vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce
Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges
this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT
co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked
Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and
(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM
block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to
produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual
information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT
significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,
showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for
visual understanding.

Abstract: Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在噪声优化或令牌修剪上存在计算开销大或语义保真度低的问题。

Method: 结合分布感知噪声优化和相似性令牌修剪，包括注意力引导的噪声优化和硬件高效的令牌修剪策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现最优的提示-图像一致性，并显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: OptiPrune同时解决了语义对齐和计算效率的挑战。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often struggle to achieve accurate semantic
alignment between generated images and text prompts while maintaining
efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Existing approaches
either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or
compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we
propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial
noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both
challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware
noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial
latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as
subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient
token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise
similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned
tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method
preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient
inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark
datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves
state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced
computational cost.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic
human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and
just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles
complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating
forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method
effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and
complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for
realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on
the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used
iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK,
and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both
simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with
realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time
performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per
iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods. The project

Abstract: 3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient
privacy, calling for reliable and efficient models suited for clinical
practice. However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity,
restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them
beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We
introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with
spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach.
TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation
priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical
flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame
strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into
a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with
preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVALRY-V是一种针对视频多模态大语言模型（V-MLLMs）的对抗攻击框架，通过双目标语义-视觉损失函数和高效的两阶段生成器，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索V-MLLMs在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 提出双目标语义-视觉损失函数和两阶段生成器框架，结合预训练和微调。

Result: 在视频理解基准测试中，CAVALRY-V平均提升22.8%，在图像理解任务中提升34.4%。

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V为多模态系统的对抗研究提供了基础性方法。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 合成数据训练CNN有效，为工业PSD监测提供了自动化潜力。

Abstract: Accurate particle size distribution (PSD) measurement is important in
industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizer manufacturing,
significantly influencing product quality and operational efficiency.
Traditional PSD methods like sieve analysis and laser diffraction are manual,
time-consuming, and limited by particle overlap. Recent developments in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable automated, real-time PSD estimation
directly from particle images. In this work, we present a CNN-based methodology
trained on realistic synthetic particle imagery generated using Blender's
advanced rendering capabilities. Synthetic data sets using this method can
replicate various industrial scenarios by systematically varying particle
shapes, textures, lighting, and spatial arrangements that closely resemble the
actual configurations. We evaluated three CNN-based architectures, ResNet-50,
InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, for predicting critical PSD parameters (d10,
d50, d90). Results demonstrated comparable accuracy across models, with
EfficientNet-B0 achieving the best computational efficiency suitable for
real-time industrial deployment. This approach shows the effectiveness of
realistic synthetic data for robust CNN training, which offers significant
potential for automated industrial PSD monitoring. The code is released at :

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像检测面临小目标、高密度分布和复杂背景等挑战，现有算法依赖手工组件且泛化能力有限，需要针对性改进。

Method: 提出HFESNet作为新骨干网络，保留高频细节；ESOP策略融合高分辨率特征；SQR和GAPE模块优化解码器稳定性和定位精度。

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上，AP$_{50}$提升5.1%，AP提升3.8%，同时保持实时速度并减少参数。

Conclusion: HEGS-DETR有效解决了无人机图像检测的特定挑战，性能显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial
challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and
cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on
hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit
limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is
threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic
architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,
resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks
have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address
these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time
Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the
High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.
HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust
semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and
occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object
Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with
minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.
Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware
Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and
localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing
explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset
demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase
over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter
count by 4M.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在深度学习降水临近预报中，使用Echo Top Height（ETH）作为辅助输入变量的效果。尽管ETH在低雨强下能提升预报技能，但在高雨强下效果不一致，且模型会系统性低估降水强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对天气敏感行业至关重要，但现有深度学习模型多依赖2D雷达反射率，忽略了3D雷达数据中的垂直信息。ETH作为反射率最大高度的2D投影，可能提供额外信息。

Method: 研究分析了ETH与雷达反射率的关系，并设计了一个单通道3D U-Net模型，同时处理雷达反射率和ETH作为输入。

Result: ETH在低雨强下能提升预报技能，但在高雨强下效果不稳定，且模型会系统性低估降水强度。案例研究显示ETH有时有帮助，有时会增加误差。

Conclusion: ETH作为辅助变量在降水临近预报中潜力有限，但研究为评估其他变量的贡献提供了基础。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

Conclusion: UAVD-Mamba通过多模态融合和多尺度处理显著提升了无人机目标检测性能。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in
traffic management, agriculture, emergency rescue, etc. However, it faces
significant challenges, including occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular
shapes. These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient
multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable
potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a
multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To
improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block
(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from
deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,
which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal
feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared
(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba
Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature
fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for
small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale
feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba
(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to
the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In
particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and
cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more
discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show
that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.
Codes will be released at https://github.com/GreatPlum-hnu/UAVD-Mamba.git.

Conclusion: SafeMap提供了一种即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了HD地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Robust high-definition (HD) map construction is vital for autonomous driving,
yet existing methods often struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data.
This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure
accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key
components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module
and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module.
G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize
the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera
views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV
representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these
components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map
generation. SafeMap is easy to implement and integrates seamlessly into
existing systems, offering a plug-and-play solution for enhanced robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that SafeMap significantly outperforms
previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, highlighting its
superior performance and reliability.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to
enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during
test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on
training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than
individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple
intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision
pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the
properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a
particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for
training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation
engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation
datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional
tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives
to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex,
compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights
especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights
challenges that need to be addressed.

Conclusion: 该方法通过早期模态对齐和任务感知表示，显著提升了3D场景理解的泛化能力。

Abstract: As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene
understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image2GS提出了一种从单图像重建逼真3D场景的新方法，专注于图像到3D的转换部分，通过解耦可见区域重建与未可见区域补全问题，提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单图像重建3D场景的挑战性问题，特别是图像到3D转换的确定性任务。

Method: 使用优化的3D高斯散点生成的可见性掩码，在训练中排除不可见区域，专注于可见区域的重建。

Result: 在可见区域的重建质量显著优于基线方法，同时在完整场景评估中与现有最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 研究表明，专注于图像到3D转换的专门技术能显著提升重建质量，同时揭示了判别式模型在拟合未见区域时的局限性。

Abstract: We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing
specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction
process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model
representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating
content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable
for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from
optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view
during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves
reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.
Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains
competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target
images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the
fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and
demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct
problem with specialized techniques.

TL;DR: 利用术前MRI数据和术中单张图像，通过神经风格迁移实现快速单图像NeRF训练，解决手术场景中多视图数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在手术场景中因多视图数据需求受限，术中采集数据不现实，需一种高效的单图像训练方法。

Method: 结合术前MRI数据定义视角，通过WTC2和STROTSS风格迁移生成训练集，实现单图像NeRF训练。

Result: 在四个神经外科案例中验证，与真实显微镜图像训练的NeRF相比，重建保真度和风格对齐表现优异。

Conclusion: 单图像NeRF训练在手术场景中可行，突破了传统多视图方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Result: 在多个自动驾驶数据集上验证了RTMap在地图质量和定位精度上的优异表现。

Conclusion: RTMap能有效支持下游预测和规划模块，同时异步提升众包地图的准确性和新鲜度。

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and
solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion
in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose
RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a
multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap
simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)
Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)
probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)
real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on
several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on
both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating
our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning
modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the
crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon).

TL;DR: 论文提出了PDE（Procedural Depth Evaluation）基准测试，用于系统评估单目深度估计模型的鲁棒性，填补了现有基准测试仅关注准确性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但这些测试主要评估准确性而非鲁棒性，因此需要一种新方法来全面评估模型性能。

Method: 通过程序化生成3D场景，模拟物体、相机、材质和光照等多种扰动，构建PDE基准测试。

Result: 研究发现当前最先进的深度模型在某些扰动下表现不佳，揭示了其鲁棒性不足的问题。

Conclusion: PDE基准测试为深度估计模型的鲁棒性评估提供了新工具，有助于指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth
estimation, particularly as measured by the success of large models on standard
benchmarks. However, performance on standard benchmarks does not offer a
complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art
depth models, which we hope will inform further research. Code and data are

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分割引导的文本生成框架，通过像素级视觉文本掩码作为统一条件输入，解决了现有方法在字体风格和颜色保留上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成方法在视觉文本渲染中存在模糊字形、语义漂移和风格控制有限的问题，且依赖预渲染字形图像导致模型复杂性和灵活性降低。

Method: 提出两个核心组件：(1) 微调的双语分割模型用于精确提取文本掩码，(2) 增强的扩散模型结合自适应字形条件和区域特定损失。

Result: 在AnyText基准测试中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法，并在新提出的GlyphMM和MiniText基准测试中大幅领先。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂排版和小文本渲染中表现出色，验证了其强大的泛化能力和部署准备性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet
accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs,
semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on
pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original
font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that
increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we
propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks
-- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional
inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual
segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined
diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a
region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,
significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To
enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:
GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex
typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in
small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at
small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong
generalization and deployment readiness.

findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We
first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential
through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the

unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability
enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving,

TL;DR: ShapeEmbed是一种自监督表示学习框架，用于编码2D图像中对象的轮廓，生成对平移、缩放、旋转、反射和点索引不变的形状描述符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形状量化中保持对象内在几何不变性的核心挑战，克服传统形状描述符的局限性。

Method: 使用欧几里得距离矩阵表示对象轮廓，通过自监督学习框架生成不变形状描述符。

Result: 在自然和生物图像的形状分类任务中，ShapeEmbed的描述符优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeEmbed在生物成像应用中具有潜在的重要价值。

Abstract: The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide
range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to
ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that
preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,
orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,
a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the
contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,
into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of
traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by
our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on
natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular
relevance to biological imaging applications.

Motivation: 现实世界的视频超分辨率面临复杂且不可预测的退化问题，现有方法在时间一致性和细节生成上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DAM-VSR框架，将视频超分辨率解耦为外观增强和运动控制问题，分别通过参考图像超分辨率和视频ControlNet实现，并采用运动对齐的双向采样策略。

Result: DAM-VSR在真实世界数据和AIGC数据上实现了最先进的性能，展现了强大的细节生成能力。

Conclusion: DAM-VSR通过解耦外观和运动，充分利用了视频扩散模型和图像超分辨率模型的优势，显著提升了视频超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due
to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize
image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation
capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We
attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address
this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of
SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos.
To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion
disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into
appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance
enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion
control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully
leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail
generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped
with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can
conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail
generation capabilities.

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic

generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight

Result: 实验表明，该方法及其数据集支持用户根据需求迭代优化语音风格，验证了多步交互能力。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了TTS系统中风格细化调整的空白，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换依赖音频输入，但在无声视频或嘈杂环境中无法使用。SFVC旨在仅通过视觉输入实现语音转换。

Method: 提出MuteSwap框架，利用对比学习对齐跨模态身份，并通过最小化互信息分离共享视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明，MuteSwap在语音合成和身份转换中表现优异，尤其在嘈杂环境下优于依赖音频的方法。

Conclusion: MuteSwap证明了SFVC的可行性，其训练方法有效解决了仅依赖视觉输入的挑战。

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

### [148] [Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities in SLMs with Reward Guided Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00054)
*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvDistill是一种基于奖励的数据集蒸馏框架，通过多代教师模型响应和规则验证器分配奖励，显著提升学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏技术中学生模型仅模仿教师模型的分布内响应，限制了其泛化能力，尤其在推理任务中效果不佳且计算成本高。

Method: AdvDistill利用教师模型对每个提示生成多个响应，并通过规则验证器分配奖励，将这些奖励作为训练学生模型的权重。

Result: 该方法显著提升了学生模型在数学和复杂推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: AdvDistill证明了在数据集蒸馏过程中引入奖励机制的有效性和优势。

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“逆向推理”的新范式，通过后验分解和解释LLMs的推理链，提升模型透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs决策过程不透明的问题，通过逆向推理提供对推理链选择的解释。

Method: 采用逆向推理和元认知结构，通过注意力机制识别关键决策点并生成解释。

Result: SAGE-nano在推理准确性（74.6%）和解释质量（92.1%人类偏好）上表现优异，接近Claude-3.5 Sonnet或GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 逆向推理框架提升了LLMs的透明度和性能，为AI安全、教育和科学发现开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTRO框架通过自回归搜索教学提升语言模型的推理能力，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索生成的数据集和强化学习，显著提升了Llama 3在数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源推理模型依赖于已有强推理能力的模型，如何提升非推理模型（如Llama 3）的推理能力尚不明确。ASTRO旨在通过结构化搜索行为训练模型。

Method: ASTRO利用蒙特卡洛树搜索生成合成数据集，将搜索轨迹转化为自然语言链式思维，并通过强化学习进一步优化模型性能。

Result: 在MATH-500、AMC 2023和AIME 2024等数学任务上，ASTRO分别带来16.0%、26.9%和20.0%的绝对性能提升，尤其在需要迭代修正的难题上表现突出。

Conclusion: ASTRO证明了搜索启发的训练方法能有效提升开放LLM的稳健推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，数学推理能力强的LLMs在其他领域表现不佳，RL调优方法比SFT更具泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨数学推理能力的提升是否反映更广泛的解决问题能力，还是仅仅是过拟合。

Method: 评估20多个开放权重模型，并在Qwen3-14B模型上进行数学数据调优实验。

Result: RL调优模型泛化能力强，SFT调优模型易遗忘通用能力。

Conclusion: 需重新考虑后训练方法，减少对SFT蒸馏数据的依赖。

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CIP的新技术，利用因果影响图（CID）识别和减轻自主代理决策中的风险，提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的自主代理在辅助任务中展现出潜力，确保其行为安全可靠至关重要。

Method: 通过三个步骤实现：初始化CID以描述决策过程，利用CID指导代理与环境交互，并根据观察结果迭代优化CID。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在代码执行和移动设备控制任务中显著提升了安全性。

Conclusion: CIP技术通过CID有效提升了自主代理的安全性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI是一种无需训练的GUI自然语言查询框架，通过动态视觉接地和模态感知优化解决GUI多样性、视觉杂乱和语言歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI中的视觉元素多样、空间杂乱且语言查询存在歧义，传统方法难以处理。

Method: 将GUI分为文本和图标元素，利用通用视觉语言模型独立处理各模态，动态生成候选焦点区域并逐步细化。

Result: 在标准GUI接地基准测试中表现优于基线方法，验证了模态分离与区域聚焦推理的有效性。

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI通过动态聚焦和模态分离，无需额外训练即可显著提升GUI接地性能。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出TalentMine框架，通过增强LLM语义理解能力，解决表格数据在人才管理系统中语义信息丢失的问题，显著提升查询准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格提取方法在语义理解上表现不佳，导致人才管理系统中表格数据的语义关系丢失，影响信息检索和决策。

Method: 引入TalentMine框架，结合多模态推理生成语义丰富的表格表示，避免传统CSV或文本线性化的局限性。

Result: 实验显示TalentMine在查询任务中达到100%准确率，远超AWS Textract的0%和40%表现。

Conclusion: TalentMine通过语义增强的表格表示，显著提升人才管理系统的信息检索性能，为相关应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

TL;DR: MassTool是一个多任务搜索框架，通过双塔架构和查询中心图卷积网络提升工具检索精度，解决现有方法忽略查询理解的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具检索方法多关注工具表示优化，忽视查询理解的重要性，MassTool旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双塔架构：工具使用检测塔和工具检索塔（QC-GCN），结合搜索式用户意图建模（SUIM）和自适应知识转移（AdaKT）模块。

Result: 实验证明MassTool显著提升检索精度。

Conclusion: MassTool通过多任务学习和查询理解优化，实现了高效的工具检索。

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新指标L-AP和P-AP，用于更全面地评估实时3D目标检测，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估3D目标检测时忽略了速度与精度的权衡、硬件差异对实时应用的影响，以及检测结果对运动规划的安全性影响。

Method: 引入L-AP和P-AP指标，结合nuPlan数据集评估模型，并通过L-HPO优化模型性能。

Result: 验证了新指标的有效性，优化了硬件和模型选择，并纠正了关于点云数量的错误假设。

Conclusion: 新指标为实时3D目标检测提供了更全面的评估方法，优化了系统性能。

Abstract: High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型基于预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs），缺乏精确的空间理解能力，因为VLMs主要基于2D图像-文本对训练。

Method: 通过利用现成的视觉几何基础模型，设计了一个即插即用的模块，隐式注入3D几何特征到VLA模型中。

Result: 在五个需要精确空间理解能力的任务中，该方法显著提升了VLA模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外深度传感器或缺陷估计，有效增强了VLA模型的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: RoboEval通过揭示策略失败的具体原因，提供了更深入、可操作的机器人操作理解，强调需要超越单纯成功率的评估工具。

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了手术机器人导航的精度和稳定性，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing
the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

Result: 在定位、SLAM和自主导航任务中表现可靠且泛化能力强，适用于资源受限设备。

Conclusion: RaGNNarok为低成本室内移动机器人提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages

demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Motivation: 解决现有动作分词器数据量不足的问题，利用合成数据缩小与真实数据的差距，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative vector quantization based action
tokenizer built upon the largest-scale action trajectory dataset to date,
leveraging over 100 times more data than previous approaches. This extensive
dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics,
resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates
smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be
seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,
from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding
of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action
trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of
synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To
validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated
environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the
volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer
on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%
higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and
scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way
for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application
domains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io

TL;DR: 本文对比特币白皮书中的简化支付验证（SPV）进行了完整的规范描述和数学证明，证明其在特定条件下是安全且最优的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清SPV的误解，证明其在数字现金系统中的安全性和最优性。

Method: 基于符号自动机、Merkle成员关系和证明链主导谓词重建SPV协议，并进行概率和博弈论分析。

Result: 证明了SPV在部分连接、敌对中继网络和传播延迟下的安全性和活性。

Conclusion: 本文为SPV的安全实现提供了蓝图，并反驳了关于非验证客户端的常见误解。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了Vision Mamba（ViM）对后门攻击的脆弱性，提出了针对ViM的新型后门攻击框架BadViM，利用共振频率触发器和隐藏状态对齐损失实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision SSMs（如ViM）作为ViTs的替代方案，其安全性尤其是后门攻击的脆弱性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出BadViM框架，使用共振频率触发器（RFT）和隐藏状态对齐损失，攻击ViM模型。

Result: BadViM攻击成功率高且不影响干净数据准确性，同时对常见防御措施（如PatchDrop、PatchShuffle和JPEG压缩）具有强抵抗力。

Conclusion: ViM对后门攻击存在显著脆弱性，BadViM框架为未来防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种射击可视化系统，结合第一人称视频与图形化指标，评估其对新手和专家射手的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前射击训练主要依赖重复练习，教练无法实时观察射手视角，分析仅限于姿势和准确性。希望通过可视化系统提升训练效果。

Method: 开发了五种复合可视化视图，结合第一人称视频与覆盖指标，通过混合方法研究（任务、偏好比较、访谈）评估10名参与者（5专家、5新手）。

Result: 仪表盘式复合视图（结合原始视频、极坐标图和图表）在10例中9例被偏好，且支持不同技能水平的理解。

Conclusion: 第一人称视频与可视化分析结合对射击训练有广泛价值，可推广至其他精准运动。

Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police,
military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic
shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and
coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through
the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy
post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and
evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To
achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person
shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical
summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen,
5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming
interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured
interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining
raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases
and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this
design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with
visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this
approach to other precision-based sports.

Motivation: 现有NL-to-TL翻译系统在现有基准上表现优异，但仅关注翻译准确性，忽略了命题落地能力，导致性能指标虚高，缺乏领域通用性。

Method: 引入VLTL-Bench基准，包含多样化的自然语言规范、形式化时序逻辑规范及验证样本，支持端到端评估及各子步骤（如提升、落地、翻译、验证）的独立分析。

Result: VLTL-Bench提供了三个独特状态空间和大量样本，支持全面评估，并公开数据集以促进方法改进。

Conclusion: VLTL-Bench填补了现有基准的不足，推动了可验证NL-to-LTL翻译方法的发展。

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

Motivation: 传统方法依赖表格化BRDF数据，而神经隐式表示虽灵活但频域行为理解不足，需改进以实现更真实的渲染效果。

Method: 提出频率校正损失函数，结合球谐函数，构建通用且自适应的重建与编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，FreNBRDF在材质外观重建和编辑上优于现有方法，提升了保真度、适应性和效率。

Conclusion: FreNBRDF为材质建模提供了更结构化和可解释的解决方案，适用于下游任务和应用。

Abstract: Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering,
bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs.
While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has
shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and
flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the
frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce
FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging
spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural
BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a
frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable
and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances
fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance
reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling
more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在精度损失问题，作者将其重新定义为信息扩散问题，旨在通过信息论方法解决。

Method: 引入HDRAM框架，利用超令牌（hypertokens）结合经典纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，在潜在空间中实现高效键值操作和搜索。

Result: HDRAM显著提升了关联检索能力，且无需改变模型架构。

Conclusion: 通过经典-全息-量子启发（CHQ）原则，HDRAM为增强Transformer架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

Result: 改进方法在指令跟随任务中实现25%相对增益和6%绝对胜率提升。

Conclusion: 理论框架扩展了LLM logits与Q函数的关系，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

Result: ROSE在揭示LLM安全漏洞方面优于现有方法，综合评估指标显著提升。

Conclusion: ROSE为更实用和现实导向的LLM安全评估迈出一步。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper
contains examples of potentially harmful text.

Result: 理论分析表明，连续时间序列补丁可量化为离散词汇，其统计特性与自然语言高度一致，解释了模型的优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文为理解、评估和改进大规模时间序列基础模型的安全性和可靠性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Result: 实验表明，FedHLM减少95%以上的LLM传输，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHLM适用于高效、可扩展的边缘AI应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Conclusion: 通过因果保真和时空对齐，该方法提升了模型可解释性，为透明决策提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Conclusion: AutoDS是迈向开放科学发现系统的重要一步，展示了基于认知转变的高效探索潜力。

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms

Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为μ²LLM的多尺度多模态大语言模型，用于自动化放射学报告生成（RRG），通过μ²Tokenizer整合多模态特征，并结合DPO优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RRG任务中的两个关键挑战：从影像数据中提取信息的复杂性以及模型生成报告与专家报告间差异的客观评估困难。

Method: 提出μ²LLM模型，利用μ²Tokenizer整合多尺度视觉和文本特征，并通过DPO优化生成质量。

Result: 在四个大型CT影像数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: μ²LLM在有限数据下表现出色，展示了其在RRG任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中表现优异，展示了框架的灵活建模能力。

Conclusion: TarFlowLM为语言建模提供了新的灵活性和性能提升。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了状态空间模型（SSMs）在长上下文建模中的局限性，并提出了一种结合上下文相关稀疏注意力（CDSA）的解决方案HAX，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理中长上下文建模的效率问题，尤其是SSMs在捕捉长距离依赖时的不足。

Method: 提出新的合成任务joint recall，证明SSMs的局限性，并设计HAX方法结合CDSA。

Result: HAX在合成和真实长上下文任务中优于SSMs及CISA方法。

Conclusion: HAX通过理论分析与实际结合，有效提升了长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

Motivation: 大型预训练模型微调需要大量计算资源和存储，现有方法如GPS虽减少参数但增加资源需求，需更高效的方法。

Method: GRFT通过更新权重矩阵中梯度平方和最高的行或列，结合正则化提升知识迁移，减少参数更新量。

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB数据集上仅需更新1.22%和0.30%的参数，性能优于GPS、Adapter Tuning和LoRA。

Conclusion: GRFT高效且有效，显著减少资源需求，性能领先，代码将开源。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA为城市轨迹数据提供了一种统一的多尺度表示框架，显著提升了轨迹分析的性能。

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Conclusion: 研究为GANs的正则化策略提供了新视角，并展示了边际似然优化的潜力。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

Conclusion: Audio-3DVG展示了语音与3D视觉结合的可行性，为未来多模态3D任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了分类器引导的稳定性，同时保持了样本多样性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了生成模型中的条件采样技术，使更多分类器可用于引导生成。

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

Conclusion: 合成数据与真实数据差距小，适用于数据增强。

Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both
accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data
availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine
learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM
(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and
leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of
privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that
focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D
semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full
volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D
image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space
of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model
significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical
3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic
medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional
Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images
(0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model
have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing
delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods
for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to
apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are
based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial
information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the
first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach
integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic
sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses
multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel
attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates
synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from
different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean
absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and
approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor. Code is available at:

Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two
cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image
segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM
U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature
localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior
performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably,
VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while
maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational
efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and
CPU. Overall, the study suggests that the enhanced architecture VMSE-Unet is a
valuable tool for medical image analysis. These findings highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications, emphasizing the importance of
further research to optimize accuracy, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

### [192] [Bridging Classical and Learning-based Iterative Registration through Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00582)
*Yi Zhang,Yidong Zhao,Qian Tao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度平衡模型（DEQ）的医学图像配准框架DEQReg，解决了传统学习展开方法的内存消耗和收敛性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习展开方法在医学图像配准中缺乏理论收敛保证且内存消耗大，DEQReg旨在通过平衡模型解决这些问题。

Method: DEQReg将配准问题转化为平衡寻求问题，利用DEQ模型实现恒定内存消耗和理论上无限的迭代步数。

Result: 在脑MRI和肺CT数据集上，DEQReg表现出与现有方法相当的配准性能，同时显著降低内存消耗。

Conclusion: DEQReg通过平衡机制实现稳定收敛，弥合了传统优化方法与现代学习方法的差距。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an
optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,
recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic
this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed
number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient
iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence
guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have
a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with
the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both
theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration
framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration
as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between
classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains
constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.
Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we
show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while
substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art
unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of
existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly
when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,
DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking
mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern
learning-based registration methods.

TL;DR: 提出MTCNet，一种半监督学习方法，用于4D二尖瓣超声分割，通过运动-拓扑引导的一致性网络解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D二尖瓣分析方法缺乏相位间依赖关系，导致分析效果受限。

Method: 设计跨相位运动引导一致性学习策略和拓扑引导相关性正则化，利用稀疏标注数据。

Result: 在160名患者的1408个相位数据集上，MTCNet表现优异（Dice: 87.30%，HD: 1.75mm）。

Conclusion: MTCNet通过结合运动与拓扑信息，显著提升了4D二尖瓣分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“语义多样性重建”（SDR）的方法，旨在解决现有深度学习MRI重建技术可能遗漏小且罕见病理信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI重建技术在高加速因子下表现优异，但可能遗漏临床相关的小病理信息，导致误诊。

Method: 提出SDR方法，生成语义多样性更高的重建图像，同时确保与测量数据一致。通过训练目标检测器自动评估。

Result: SDR显著减少了假阴性诊断的可能性，提高了平均精度。

Conclusion: SDR方法在保留临床相关信息方面优于传统重建技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has
led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for
high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality
is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant
information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.
In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering
resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small
and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions
(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we
propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given
an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced
semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured
data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the
fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of
false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision
compared to the original reconstructions. The code is available on
https://github.com/NikolasMorshuis/SDR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示的交互式多器官和多疾病分割方法，特别针对胸部X光片，并介绍了轻量级模型Prompt2SegCXR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型局限于特定器官或疾病，缺乏灵活性。目前缺乏针对胸部X光片的基于提示的多器官和多疾病分割方法。

Method: 生成医疗专家绘制的涂鸦提示数据集，包含23个类别（6个器官和17种疾病），并开发轻量级模型Prompt2SegCXR，采用多阶段特征融合技术。

Result: 模型在基于提示的胸部X光片分割任务中表现优异，优于现有预训练模型。

Conclusion: Prompt2SegCXR为基于用户提示的胸部X光片分割提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating
organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally,
segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting
their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced
models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater
flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained
attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based
on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated
work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,
especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,
generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from
multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,
specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we
introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple
organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage
feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for
better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,
our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest
X-rays based on user prompts.

Motivation: 提高视网膜前膜手术类型的分类准确性，以支持临床决策。

Method: 使用ResNet18 CNN架构，结合术后OCT扫描图像，并引入可调小波单元（OrthLatt-UwU和PR-Relax-UwU）优化模型。

Result: 预处理后输入准确率达72%，引入OrthLatt-UwU和PR-Relax-UwU后分别提升至76%和78%，优于人类专家的50%。

Conclusion: CNN模型结合可调小波单元在ERM手术分类中表现优异，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current
research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of
micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting
detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection
model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a
new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the
backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.
Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to
fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's
ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head
GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more
deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that
compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter
count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by
7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection
accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合解剖学基础的启发式学习后处理方法，用于降低深度学习模型在CTA中检测颅内动脉瘤时的假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在检测颅内动脉瘤方面有所改进，但高假阳性率仍是临床应用的障碍。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CPM-Net和3D-CNN-TR）并结合基于解剖学的后处理策略，如脑、动脉、静脉分割掩码，以减少假阳性。

Result: 最佳后处理方法（方法5）显著降低了假阳性率（CPM-Net降低70.6%，3D-CNN-TR降低51.6%），且未减少真阳性。

Conclusion: 基于解剖学的后处理方法能有效提升深度学习模型的性能，为动脉瘤检测模型的临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

Conclusion: DL可用于T1/T2图分割，ML结合多特征显著提升疾病检测效果。

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable
clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models
have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation
tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based
on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of
Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in
multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation
mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences
between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with
the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal
MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation
accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.
Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art
diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an
HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided
diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.
