*Jesus Alvarez C,Daua D. Karajeanes,Ashley Celeste Prado,John Ruttan,Ivory Yang,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次对濒危语言科曼奇语进行了计算语言学分析，通过低成本、社区参与的NLP方法支持语言保护，展示了少量样本提示显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决濒危语言在NLP中的数字排斥问题，支持语言研究和复兴。

Method: 构建手动标注的412条短语数据集、合成数据生成流程，并评估GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在少量样本提示下的表现。

Result: 少量样本提示显著提升模型性能，仅需五个样本即可达到接近完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言NLP提供了可行方法，强调可见性是包容的第一步，倡导注重可访问性、文化敏感性和社区参与的计算方法。

Abstract: The digital exclusion of endangered languages remains a critical challenge in
NLP, limiting both linguistic research and revitalization efforts. This study
introduces the first computational investigation of Comanche, an Uto-Aztecan
language on the verge of extinction, demonstrating how minimal-cost,
community-informed NLP interventions can support language preservation. We
present a manually curated dataset of 412 phrases, a synthetic data generation
pipeline, and an empirical evaluation of GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for language
identification. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with Comanche
in zero-shot settings, few-shot prompting significantly improves performance,
achieving near-perfect accuracy with just five examples. Our findings highlight
the potential of targeted NLP methodologies in low-resource contexts and
emphasize that visibility is the first step toward inclusion. By establishing a
foundation for Comanche in NLP, we advocate for computational approaches that
prioritize accessibility, cultural sensitivity, and community engagement.

### [2] [Do BERT-Like Bidirectional Models Still Perform Better on Text Classification in the Era of LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18215)
*Junyan Zhang,Yiming Huang,Shuliang Liu,Yubo Gao,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，BERT类模型在文本分类中常优于LLM，提出任务驱动的选择策略TaMAS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战LLM主导趋势，验证BERT类模型在文本分类中的优势。

Method: 比较BERT微调、LLM内部状态利用和零样本推理，分类数据集并分析模型表现。

Result: BERT类模型在模式驱动任务中表现更好，LLM在深度语义任务中占优。

Conclusion: 提出TaMAS策略，建议根据任务特性选择模型，而非依赖单一LLM。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of LLMs has overshadowed the potential advantages of
traditional BERT-like models in text classification. This study challenges the
prevailing "LLM-centric" trend by systematically comparing three category
methods, i.e., BERT-like models fine-tuning, LLM internal state utilization,
and zero-shot inference across six high-difficulty datasets. Our findings
reveal that BERT-like models often outperform LLMs. We further categorize
datasets into three types, perform PCA and probing experiments, and identify
task-specific model strengths: BERT-like models excel in pattern-driven tasks,
while LLMs dominate those requiring deep semantics or world knowledge. Based on
this, we propose TaMAS, a fine-grained task selection strategy, advocating for
a nuanced, task-driven approach over a one-size-fits-all reliance on LLMs.

### [3] [CoMet: Metaphor-Driven Covert Communication for Multi-Agent Language Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18218)
*Shuhang Xu,Fangwei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoMet框架通过结合假设推理和自省知识整合，提升LLM在多智能体语言游戏中的隐喻处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在隐喻理解和应用上存在困难，影响其在战略沟通中的表现。

Method: CoMet结合假设推理的隐喻解析器和自省知识整合的隐喻生成器。

Result: 在Undercover和Adversarial Taboo游戏中，CoMet显著提升了智能体的战略沟通能力。

Conclusion: CoMet有效提升了LLM在隐喻处理中的表现，增强了多智能体交互的战略性和细腻度。

Abstract: Metaphors are a crucial way for humans to express complex or subtle ideas by
comparing one concept to another, often from a different domain. However, many
large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in
multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert
communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic
communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that
enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a
hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves
through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents'
ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced
quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language
games - Undercover and Adversarial Taboo - which emphasize Covert Communication
and Semantic Evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMet significantly
enhances the agents' ability to communicate strategically using metaphors.

### [4] [IDA-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Interactive Guided Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18223)
*Hanyu Li,Haoyu Liu,Tingyu Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Zeyu Zheng,Xiaotie Deng,Michael I. Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDA-Bench是一个新基准，用于评估LLM在多轮交互场景中的表现，揭示现有模型在复杂任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未考虑数据分析的迭代性，专家决策会随数据深入而变化，因此需要新基准。

Method: 基于复杂Kaggle笔记本设计任务，模拟用户通过自然语言指令多轮交互，比较模型输出与人类基准。

Result: 即使先进编码代理（如Claude-3.7-thinking）在任务中成功率低于50%，单轮测试未暴露此问题。

Conclusion: 需提升LLM多轮能力以构建更可靠数据分析代理，平衡指令遵循与推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as data analysis agents, but
existing benchmarks overlook the iterative nature of the field, where experts'
decisions evolve with deeper insights of the dataset. To address this, we
introduce IDA-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLM agents in multi-round
interactive scenarios. Derived from complex Kaggle notebooks, tasks are
presented as sequential natural language instructions by an LLM-simulated user.
Agent performance is judged by comparing its final numerical output to the
human-derived baseline. Initial results show that even state-of-the-art coding
agents (like Claude-3.7-thinking) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, highlighting
limitations not evident in single-turn tests. This work underscores the need to
improve LLMs' multi-round capabilities for building more reliable data analysis
agents, highlighting the necessity of achieving a balance between instruction
following and reasoning.

### [5] [Think or Not? Exploring Thinking Efficiency in Large Reasoning Models via an Information-Theoretic Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18237)
*Xixian Yong,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Jinlin Li,Yefeng Zheng,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息论的熵自适应策略（Adaptive Think），通过动态停止推理链，显著提高了大型推理模型（LRMs）的效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的多步推理性能虽强，但推理链过长导致效率低下。本文从信息论角度探讨推理效率，揭示推理长度与语义效率之间的权衡。

Method: 提出两种指标（InfoBias和InfoGain）量化推理路径的偏差和步骤信息贡献，并引入熵自适应策略动态停止推理。

Result: 实验表明，该策略在QwQ-32B上平均准确率提升1.10%，令牌使用减少50.80%，效率和性能均优于默认模式。

Conclusion: 熵自适应策略为大型语言模型的准确性和成本效率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has significantly improved
multi-step reasoning performance, but often at the cost of generating
excessively long reasoning chains. This paper revisits the efficiency of such
reasoning processes through an information-theoretic lens, revealing a
fundamental trade-off between reasoning length and semantic efficiency. We
propose two metrics, InfoBias and InfoGain, to quantify divergence from ideal
reasoning paths and stepwise information contribution, respectively. Empirical
analyses show that longer reasoning chains tend to exhibit higher information
bias and diminishing information gain, especially for incorrect answers.
Motivated by these findings, we introduce an entropy-based Adaptive Think
strategy that dynamically halts reasoning once confidence is sufficiently high,
improving efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. Compared to the
Vanilla Think approach (default mode), our strategy yields a 1.10% improvement
in average accuracy and a 50.80% reduction in token usage on QwQ-32B across six
benchmark tasks spanning diverse reasoning types and difficulty levels,
demonstrating superior efficiency and reasoning performance. These results
underscore the promise of entropy-based methods for enhancing both accuracy and
cost-effiiciency in large language model deployment.

### [6] [Taming LLMs with Negative Samples: A Reference-Free Framework to Evaluate Presentation Content with Actionable Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18240)
*Ananth Muppidi,Tarak Das,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Tripti Shukla,Dharun D A*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REFLEX的评估方法，用于自动生成演示幻灯片的多模态内容评估，并通过基准数据集RefSlides和扰动样本微调LLMs，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式AI时代，自动生成演示幻灯片的内容评估是一个重要问题，需要一种有效的方法来确保内容能概括文档并传达概念。

Method: 提出基准数据集RefSlides，设计一组指标评估演示内容，并通过扰动样本微调LLMs，开发了无需参考的评估技术REFLEX。

Result: REFLEX在自动和人工实验中表现优于传统启发式和基于大语言模型的评估方法。

Conclusion: REFLEX提供了一种高效且无需参考的演示内容评估方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The generation of presentation slides automatically is an important problem
in the era of generative AI. This paper focuses on evaluating multimodal
content in presentation slides that can effectively summarize a document and
convey concepts to a broad audience. We introduce a benchmark dataset,
RefSlides, consisting of human-made high-quality presentations that span
various topics. Next, we propose a set of metrics to characterize different
intrinsic properties of the content of a presentation and present REFLEX, an
evaluation approach that generates scores and actionable feedback for these
metrics. We achieve this by generating negative presentation samples with
different degrees of metric-specific perturbations and use them to fine-tune
LLMs. This reference-free evaluation technique does not require ground truth
presentations during inference. Our extensive automated and human experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation approach outperforms classical heuristic-based
and state-of-the-art large language model-based evaluations in generating
scores and explanations.

### [7] [Multi-Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory: A Hierarchical Framework for Interpreting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18244)
*Yukin Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度概率生成理论（MSPGT），用于解释Transformer模型生成文本的层次结构，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型Transformer语言模型性能卓越但生成机制不透明，需一种统一框架解释其生成过程。

Method: 提出MSPGT框架，将生成过程分解为全局、中间和局部三个尺度，并通过注意力跨度阈值和层间互信息峰值确定尺度边界。

Result: 实验表明，不同模型（如GPT-2、BERT等）在尺度分配上存在差异，局部干预影响词汇多样性，中间干预影响句子结构，全局干预影响篇章连贯性。

Conclusion: MSPGT为解释、诊断和控制大型语言模型提供了统一方法，填补了机制可解释性与涌现能力之间的空白。

Abstract: Large Transformer based language models achieve remarkable performance but
remain opaque in how they plan, structure, and realize text. We introduce
Multi_Scale Probabilistic Generation Theory (MSPGT), a hierarchical framework
that factorizes generation into three semantic scales_global context,
intermediate structure, and local word choices and aligns each scale with
specific layer ranges in Transformer architectures. To identify scale
boundaries, we propose two complementary metrics: attention span thresholds and
inter layer mutual information peaks. Across four representative models (GPT-2,
BERT, RoBERTa, and T5), these metrics yield stable local/intermediate/global
partitions, corroborated by probing tasks and causal interventions. We find
that decoder_only models allocate more layers to intermediate and global
processing while encoder_only models emphasize local feature extraction.
Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate that local scale manipulations
primarily influence lexical diversity, intermediate-scale modifications affect
sentence structure and length, and global_scale perturbations impact discourse
coherence all with statistically significant effects. MSPGT thus offers a
unified, architecture-agnostic method for interpreting, diagnosing, and
controlling large language models, bridging the gap between mechanistic
interpretability and emergent capabilities.

### [8] [MetaGen Blended RAG: Higher Accuracy for Domain-Specific Q&A Without Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247)
*Kunal Sawarkar,Shivam R. Solanki,Abhilasha Mangal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'MetaGen Blended RAG'的方法，通过混合查询索引和元数据增强来提升企业特定领域数据集的检索精度，避免了微调的高成本和低泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业特定领域数据集（如医疗、法律等）由于术语复杂且语义多变，导致RAG系统精度不足，而现有微调方法成本高且泛化能力差。

Method: 构建元数据生成管道，利用关键概念、主题和缩写创建元数据增强的混合索引，并结合优化的搜索查询。

Result: 在PubMedQA生物医学领域基准测试中，检索精度达82%，RAG精度达77%，优于未微调的RAG结果，甚至媲美最佳微调模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本设置下表现优异，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，适用于多领域问答任务。

Abstract: Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due
to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in
private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific
terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant
semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal,
etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor
context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning
or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive,
and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges.
We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the
retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and
metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata
generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates
a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach
avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA
benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval
accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results
without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while
outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable
to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the
robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&A
datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc.

*Jianghao Wu,Feilong Tang,Yulong Li,Ming Hu,Haochen Xue,Shoaib Jameel,Yutong Xie,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TAGS框架通过结合通用模型和领域专家模型，无需微调即可提升零样本医学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于提示的方法浅层不稳定，以及微调模型在分布偏移和未见临床场景下泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 结合通用模型与领域专家模型，引入分层检索机制和可靠性评分模块。

Result: 在九个MedQA基准上表现优异，显著提升多个模型的准确率。

Conclusion: TAGS无需参数更新即可超越多个微调医学LLM，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances such as Chain-of-Thought prompting have significantly
improved large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot medical reasoning. However,
prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned
medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and
limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these
limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly
capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary
perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support
this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary
modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars
by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity,
and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final
answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA
benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and
improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several
fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates. The code will be
available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/TAGS.

### [10] [Thinking Fast and Right: Balancing Accuracy and Reasoning Length with Adaptive Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18298)
*Jinyan Su,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应奖励调整方法，使大语言模型在保持准确性的同时减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL训练的大语言模型常产生冗长的推理过程，增加推理成本和延迟，现有固定惩罚方法难以适应模型能力变化。

Method: 动态调整奖励函数，根据模型表现平衡准确性和输出长度：高准确时增加长度惩罚，低准确时放松惩罚。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少推理长度，同时基本保持准确性。

Conclusion: 为大规模语言模型提供了一种成本高效的自适应推理新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in
mathematical tasks, often enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, RL-trained models frequently produce unnecessarily long reasoning
traces -- even for simple queries -- leading to increased inference costs and
latency. While recent approaches attempt to control verbosity by adding length
penalties to the reward function, these methods rely on fixed penalty terms
that are hard to tune and cannot adapt as the model's reasoning capability
evolves, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an adaptive
reward-shaping method that enables LLMs to "think fast and right" -- producing
concise outputs without sacrificing correctness. Our method dynamically adjusts
the reward trade-off between accuracy and response length based on model
performance: when accuracy is high, the length penalty increases to encourage
faster length reduction; when accuracy drops, the penalty is relaxed to
preserve correctness. This adaptive reward accelerates early-stage length
reduction while avoiding over-compression in later stages. Experiments across
multiple datasets show that our approach consistently and dramatically reduces
reasoning length while largely maintaining accuracy, offering a new direction
for cost-efficient adaptive reasoning in large-scale language models.

### [11] [Is It Bad to Work All the Time? Cross-Cultural Evaluation of Social Norm Biases in GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18322)
*Zhuozhuo Joy Liu,Farhan Samir,Mehar Bhatia,Laura K. Nelson,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4生成的规范文化特异性不足，且隐含刻板印象，需改进以公平服务多元用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能在实际场景中一致应用西方或北美文化价值观。

Method: 采用自下而上方法，让LLMs推理不同文化叙事中的规范。

Result: GPT-4生成的规范文化特异性较弱，且隐含刻板印象。

Conclusion: 需解决这些问题以开发公平服务多元用户的LLMs。

Abstract: LLMs have been demonstrated to align with the values of Western or North
American cultures. Prior work predominantly showed this effect through
leveraging surveys that directly ask (originally people and now also LLMs)
about their values. However, it is hard to believe that LLMs would consistently
apply those values in real-world scenarios. To address that, we take a
bottom-up approach, asking LLMs to reason about cultural norms in narratives
from different cultures. We find that GPT-4 tends to generate norms that, while
not necessarily incorrect, are significantly less culture-specific. In
addition, while it avoids overtly generating stereotypes, the stereotypical
representations of certain cultures are merely hidden rather than suppressed in
the model, and such stereotypes can be easily recovered. Addressing these
challenges is a crucial step towards developing LLMs that fairly serve their
diverse user base.

### [12] [PerMedCQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Medical Consumer Question Answering in Persian Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18331)
*Naghmeh Jamali,Milad Mohammadi,Danial Baledi,Zahra Rezvani,Hesham Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerMedCQA是首个波斯语医疗问答基准数据集，包含68,138个问题-答案对，用于评估多语言大语言模型在真实世界医疗问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补波斯语等低资源语言在医疗消费者问答领域的空白，提供个性化且可靠的医疗信息。

Method: 从大型医疗问答论坛收集数据，经过清洗后构建PerMedCQA数据集，并使用MedJudge评估框架对多语言大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 研究揭示了多语言医疗问答中的关键挑战，为开发更准确、上下文感知的医疗辅助系统提供了见解。

Conclusion: PerMedCQA为波斯语医疗问答研究提供了重要资源，并展示了LLMs在该领域的潜力与局限。

Abstract: Medical consumer question answering (CQA) is crucial for empowering patients
by providing personalized and reliable health information. Despite recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) for medical QA, consumer-oriented and
multilingual resources, particularly in low-resource languages like Persian,
remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we present PerMedCQA, the first
Persian-language benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world,
consumer-generated medical questions. Curated from a large medical QA forum,
PerMedCQA contains 68,138 question-answer pairs, refined through careful data
cleaning from an initial set of 87,780 raw entries. We evaluate several
state-of-the-art multilingual and instruction-tuned LLMs, utilizing MedJudge, a
novel rubric-based evaluation framework driven by an LLM grader, validated
against expert human annotators. Our results highlight key challenges in
multilingual medical QA and provide valuable insights for developing more
accurate and context-aware medical assistance systems. The data is publicly
available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/NaghmehAI/PerMedCQA

### [13] [Model Editing with Graph-Based External Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18343)
*Yash Kumar Atri,Ahmed Alaa,Thomas Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HYPE框架通过双曲几何和图神经网络实现精准稳定的模型编辑，解决了大语言模型编辑中的过拟合和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和知识过时问题，现有编辑方法易导致过拟合和灾难性遗忘，需更稳定的编辑框架。

Method: 提出HYPE框架，包括双曲图构建、Möbius变换更新和双重稳定化，利用双曲几何保持知识层次结构。

Result: 实验表明HYPE显著提升编辑稳定性、事实准确性和多跳推理能力。

Conclusion: HYPE为动态更新大语言模型提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their practical utility is often limited by persistent issues of
hallucinations and outdated parametric knowledge. Although post-training model
editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently
suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and
graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE
(HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i)
Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent
knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships
and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent
concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed
Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining
structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional
Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual
Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter
resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical
parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact,
CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE
significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop
reasoning.

### [14] [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Model Merging for Cross-Lingual Transfer in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18356)
*Lucas Bandarkar,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过跨语言迁移提升低资源语言任务表现，提出模块化方法优化数学推理和多语言能力的参数组合，实验证明分层交换是最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在低资源语言任务中表现不佳，缺乏任务特定数据，需探索跨语言迁移方法。

Method: 采用模块化框架，如冻结参数或模型合并，分离数学推理和多语言能力的参数优化。

Result: 模块化方法在三种语言、四种模型和两种微调范式下均优于基线，分层交换效果最佳。

Conclusion: 分层交换是提升低资源语言任务表现的有效方法，可能与任务向量的线性特性有关。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) still struggle across tasks outside of
high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate cross-lingual transfer to
lower-resource languages where task-specific post-training data is scarce.
Building on prior work, we first validate that the subsets of model parameters
that matter most for mathematical reasoning and multilingual capabilities are
distinctly non-overlapping. To exploit this implicit separability between task
and target language parameterization, we develop and analyze numerous modular
frameworks to improve the composition of the two during fine-tuning. These
methods generally employ freezing parameters or post hoc model merging to
assign math and language improvement to different key parts of the LLM. In the
absence of in-language math data, we demonstrate that the modular approaches
successfully improve upon baselines across three languages, four models, and
two fine-tuning paradigms (full and LoRA). Furthermore, we identify the most
consistently successful modular method to be fine-tuning separate language and
math experts and model merging via Layer-Swapping, somewhat surprisingly. We
offer possible explanations for this result via recent works on the linearity
of task vectors. We further explain this by empirically showing that reverting
less useful fine-tuning updates after training often outperforms freezing them
from the start.

*AmirHossein Safdarian,Milad Mohammadi,Ehsan Jahanbakhsh,Mona Shahamat Naderi,Heshaam Faili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本、无需训练的Schema Linking方法，通过构建模式图和使用路径查找算法优化SQL生成，在BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL系统中模式链接的效率和准确性问题，减少提示大小并提升模型专注度。

Method: 基于外键关系构建模式图，利用Gemini 2.5 Flash提取查询中的表信息，应用路径查找算法确定最优表和列连接顺序。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中表现优异，超越现有复杂方法，且成本低、可扩展性强。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，显著提升了SQL查询生成的准确性，并通过消融实验验证了其性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into executable SQL
queries, and recent progress with large language models (LLMs) has driven
substantial improvements in this task. Schema linking remains a critical
component in Text-to-SQL systems, reducing prompt size for models with narrow
context windows and sharpening model focus even when the entire schema fits. We
present a zero-shot, training-free schema linking approach that first
constructs a schema graph based on foreign key relations, then uses a single
prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to extract source and destination tables from the
user query, followed by applying classical path-finding algorithms and
post-processing to identify the optimal sequence of tables and columns that
should be joined, enabling the LLM to generate more accurate SQL queries.
Despite being simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the BIRD benchmark, outperforming previous
specialized, fine-tuned, and complex multi-step LLM-based approaches. We

*Jarrod Ragsdale,Rajendra Boppana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Shell输入-输出环境（ShIOEnv），通过马尔可夫决策过程构建命令，并利用上下文无关语法屏蔽无效参数，显著提升了样本效率和数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏执行数据（如退出码、输出等），限制了行为建模的可用性，因此需要一种新方法来生成高质量的命令行交互数据集。

Method: 将命令构建建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用上下文无关语法屏蔽无效参数，并采用随机和PPO优化的采样策略生成数据集。

Result: 语法屏蔽和PPO显著提升了样本效率，生成的CodeT5微调数据集在BLEU-4指标上提升了85%（语法约束）和26%（PPO）。

Conclusion: ShIOEnv和生成的数据集为未来研究提供了工具，证明了语法约束和PPO在提升命令行行为建模效果上的有效性。

Abstract: Command-line interfaces (CLIs) provide structured textual environments for
system administration. Explorations have been performed using pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to simulate these environments for safe interaction in
high-risk environments. However, their use has been constrained to frozen,
large parameter models like GPT. For smaller architectures to reach a similar
level of believability, a rich dataset of CLI interactions is required.
Existing public datasets focus on mapping natural-language tasks to commands,
omitting crucial execution data such as exit codes, outputs, and environmental
side effects, limiting their usability for behavioral modeling. We introduce a
Shell Input -Output Environment (ShIOEnv), which casts command construction as
a Markov Decision Process whose state is the partially built sequence and whose
actions append arguments. After each action, ShIOEnv executes the candidate and
returns its exit status, output, and progress toward a minimal-length
behavioral objective. Due to the intractable nature of the combinatorial
argument state-action space, we derive a context-free grammar from man pages to
mask invalid arguments from being emitted. We explore random and
proximal-policy optimization (PPO)-optimized sampling of unrestricted and
grammar-masked action spaces to produce four exploration strategies. We
observed that grammar masking and PPO significantly improve sample efficiency
to produce a higher quality dataset (maximizing the number of arguments while
minimizing redundancies). Policy-generated datasets of shell input-output
behavior pairs are used to fine-tune CodeT5, where we observe 85% improvements
in BLEU-4 when constraining the action space to grammar productions with an
additional 26% improvement when applying PPO. The ShIOEnv environment and
curated command behavior datasets are released for use in future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种为低资源语言和文化定制预训练数据的方法，通过结合合成和检索数据，开发了针对埃及和摩洛哥社区的NileChat模型，并在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强大语言模型（LLMs）对低资源语言的支持，同时避免因依赖英语翻译数据而导致的文化偏差。

Method: 结合合成和检索数据，定制化预训练数据，考虑语言、文化遗产和文化价值，开发了NileChat模型。

Result: NileChat在理解、翻译和文化对齐任务中优于同类模型，并与更大模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs对低资源语言和文化的覆盖，推动了多样性社区的包容性发展。

Abstract: Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research
directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating
English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding
and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language
culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and
values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both
synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific
community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii)
cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan
dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and
current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop
NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities,
incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on
various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment
benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar
size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and
models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse
communities in LLM development.

Conclusion: RaDeR证明了基于推理的检索对增强推理语言模型的重要性，并在数据效率上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose RaDeR, a set of reasoning-based dense retrieval models trained
with data derived from mathematical problem solving using large language models
(LLMs). Our method leverages retrieval-augmented reasoning trajectories of an
LLM and self-reflective relevance evaluation, enabling the creation of both
diverse and hard-negative samples for reasoning-intensive relevance. RaDeR
retrievers, trained for mathematical reasoning, effectively generalize to
diverse reasoning tasks in the BRIGHT and RAR-b benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong baselines in overall performance.Notably, RaDeR achieves
significantly higher performance than baselines on the Math and Coding splits.
In addition, RaDeR presents the first dense retriever that outperforms BM25
when queries are Chain-of-Thought reasoning steps, underscoring the critical
role of reasoning-based retrieval to augment reasoning language models.
Furthermore, RaDeR achieves comparable or superior performance while using only
2.5% of the training data used by the concurrent work REASONIR, highlighting
the quality of our synthesized training data.

TL;DR: DanmakuTPPBench是一个多模态时间点过程（TPP）建模的基准测试，包含数据集DanmakuTPP-Events和问答数据集DanmakuTPP-QA，旨在推动多模态TPP研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TPP数据集多为单模态，限制了多模态（时间、文本、视觉）联合推理模型的发展。

Method: 从Bilibili平台提取多模态事件数据（DanmakuTPP-Events），并利用LLMs构建问答数据集（DanmakuTPP-QA）。

Result: 评估显示当前方法在多模态事件动态建模上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该基准为多模态TPP建模提供了基础，并呼吁进一步整合TPP与多模态语言建模。

Abstract: We introduce DanmakuTPPBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to advance
multi-modal Temporal Point Process (TPP) modeling in the era of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While TPPs have been widely studied for modeling temporal event
sequences, existing datasets are predominantly unimodal, hindering progress in
models that require joint reasoning over temporal, textual, and visual
information. To address this gap, DanmakuTPPBench comprises two complementary
components: (1) DanmakuTPP-Events, a novel dataset derived from the Bilibili
video platform, where user-generated bullet comments (Danmaku) naturally form
multi-modal events annotated with precise timestamps, rich textual content, and
corresponding video frames; (2) DanmakuTPP-QA, a challenging question-answering
dataset constructed via a novel multi-agent pipeline powered by
state-of-the-art LLMs and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), targeting complex
temporal-textual-visual reasoning. We conduct extensive evaluations using both
classical TPP models and recent MLLMs, revealing significant performance gaps
and limitations in current methods' ability to model multi-modal event
dynamics. Our benchmark establishes strong baselines and calls for further
integration of TPP modeling into the multi-modal language modeling landscape.

Abstract: As connected and automated transportation systems evolve, there is a growing
need for federal and state authorities to revise existing laws and develop new
statutes to address emerging cybersecurity and data privacy challenges. This
study introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language
Model (LLM) framework designed to support policymakers by extracting relevant
legal content and generating accurate, inquiry-specific responses. The
framework focuses on reducing hallucinations in LLMs by using a curated set of
domain-specific questions to guide response generation. By incorporating
retrieval mechanisms, the system enhances the factual grounding and specificity
of its outputs. Our analysis shows that the proposed RAG-based LLM outperforms
leading commercial LLMs across four evaluation metrics: AlignScore, ParaScore,
BERTScore, and ROUGE, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and
context-aware legal insights. This approach offers a scalable, AI-driven method
for legislative analysis, supporting efforts to update legal frameworks in line

TL;DR: 提出了一种修剪长链思维（CoT）中冗余步骤的方法，并通过策略方法为小型语言模型（SLM）筛选有效训练数据，使其高效学习长链推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型能生成长链推理步骤，但小型语言模型（SLM）难以直接学习长链推理，且冗余内容会降低学习效率。

Method: 修剪长链推理中的冗余步骤，并采用策略方法为SLM筛选有效训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效将长链推理能力蒸馏到SLM中，同时减少冗余推理步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法使SLM在保持竞争力的同时，高效学习长链推理能力。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 exhibit strong complex
problems solving abilities by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
steps. It is challenging to directly train small language models (SLMs) to
emerge long CoT. Thus, distillation becomes a practical method to enable SLMs
for such reasoning ability. However, the long CoT often contains a lot of
redundant contents (e.g., overthinking steps) which may make SLMs hard to learn
considering their relatively poor capacity and generalization. To address this
issue, we propose a simple-yet-effective method to prune unnecessary steps in
long CoT, and then employ an on-policy method for the SLM itself to curate
valid and useful long CoT training data. In this way, SLMs can effectively
learn efficient long CoT reasoning and preserve competitive performance at the
same time. Experimental results across a series of mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distilling
long CoT reasoning ability into SLMs which maintains the competitive
performance but significantly reduces generating redundant reasoning steps.

Motivation: 探索多模态文档（包含文本和图像）的RAG技术，尤其是在微调无效的情况下，提升回答复杂跨模态问题的能力。

Method: 提出BRIT框架，将文档中的文本和图像连接统一为多模态图，检索查询相关的子图，并通过遍历图像-文本路径获取更多相关内容。

Result: 实验证明BRIT在跨模态问题回答任务中表现优越，特别是在理解文本-图像关系的多模态文档上。

Conclusion: BRIT为多模态RAG提供了有效解决方案，能够处理复杂的跨模态问题，扩展了RAG的应用范围。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising technique to
enhance the quality and relevance of responses generated by large language
models. While recent advancements have mainly focused on improving RAG for
text-based queries, RAG on multi-modal documents containing both texts and
images has not been fully explored. Especially when fine-tuning does not work.
This paper proposes BRIT, a novel multi-modal RAG framework that effectively
unifies various text-image connections in the document into a multi-modal graph
and retrieves the texts and images as a query-specific sub-graph. By traversing
both image-to-text and text-to-image paths in the graph, BRIT retrieve not only
directly query-relevant images and texts but also further relevant contents to
answering complex cross-modal multi-hop questions. To evaluate the
effectiveness of BRIT, we introduce MM-RAG test set specifically designed for
multi-modal question answering tasks that require to understand the text-image
relations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of BRIT,
highlighting its ability to handle cross-modal questions on the multi-modal
documents.

TL;DR: MedScore是一种新方法，用于将医学答案分解为条件感知的有效事实，显著提高了事实性评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估系统在医学领域表现不佳，因为它们主要针对客观、实体中心的文本，而医学答案具有条件依赖性和多样性。

Method: 提出MedScore方法，通过分解医学答案为条件感知的有效事实，减少幻觉和模糊引用。

Result: MedScore提取的有效事实是现有方法的三倍，显著提高了事实性评估的可靠性。

Conclusion: 事实性评分受分解方法、验证语料库和骨干LLM的影响，强调了定制化步骤的重要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing
responses, they are not necessarily correct. This is especially apparent in the
popular decompose-then-verify factuality evaluation pipeline, where LLMs
evaluate generations by decomposing the generations into individual, valid
claims. Factuality evaluation is especially important for medical answers,
since incorrect medical information could seriously harm the patient. However,
existing factuality systems are a poor match for the medical domain, as they
are typically only evaluated on objective, entity-centric, formulaic texts such
as biographies and historical topics. This differs from condition-dependent,
conversational, hypothetical, sentence-structure diverse, and subjective
medical answers, which makes decomposition into valid facts challenging. We
propose MedScore, a new approach to decomposing medical answers into
condition-aware valid facts. Our method extracts up to three times more valid
facts than existing methods, reducing hallucination and vague references, and
retaining condition-dependency in facts. The resulting factuality score
significantly varies by decomposition method, verification corpus, and used
backbone LLM, highlighting the importance of customizing each step for reliable
factuality evaluation.

Motivation: 解决潜在推理与LLMs离散生成范式不兼容的问题，并探索LLMs的固有推理模式。

Method: 提出HRPO，通过可学习门控机制整合隐藏状态与采样标记，逐步引入隐藏特征进行训练。

Result: HRPO在知识和推理密集型任务中表现优于现有方法，同时保持模型可解释性。

Conclusion: HRPO展示了RL在潜在推理中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced latent
reasoning as a promising alternative to autoregressive reasoning. By performing
internal computation with hidden states from previous steps, latent reasoning
benefit from more informative features rather than sampling a discrete
chain-of-thought (CoT) path. Yet latent reasoning approaches are often
incompatible with LLMs, as their continuous paradigm conflicts with the
discrete nature of autoregressive generation. Moreover, these methods rely on
CoT traces for training and thus fail to exploit the inherent reasoning
patterns of LLMs. In this work, we explore latent reasoning by leveraging the
intrinsic capabilities of LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL). To this end, we
introduce hybrid reasoning policy optimization (HRPO), an RL-based hybrid
latent reasoning approach that (1) integrates prior hidden states into sampled
tokens with a learnable gating mechanism, and (2) initializes training with
predominantly token embeddings while progressively incorporating more hidden
features. This design maintains LLMs' generative capabilities and incentivizes
hybrid reasoning using both discrete and continuous representations. In
addition, the hybrid HRPO introduces stochasticity into latent reasoning via
token sampling, thereby enabling RL-based optimization without requiring CoT
trajectories. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks show that HRPO
outperforms prior methods in both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Furthermore, HRPO-trained LLMs remain interpretable and exhibit intriguing
behaviors like cross-lingual patterns and shorter completion lengths,
highlighting the potential of our RL-based approach and offer insights for
future work in latent reasoning.

TL;DR: ADLM通过两阶段框架（先预测重要token，再基于锚点预测缺失token）显著提升扩散语言模型的性能，缩小与自回归模型的差距，并在多项任务中取得SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）在并行生成和双向上下文方面有优势，但在似然建模和生成文本质量上不如自回归模型（AR）。研究发现性能差距源于重要token在早期被掩盖，导致上下文信息不足。

Method: 提出Anchored Diffusion Language Model（ADLM），两阶段框架：1）通过锚点网络预测重要token的分布；2）基于锚点预测缺失token的似然。

Result: ADLM在LM1B和OpenWebText上显著降低测试困惑度（提升25.4%），缩小与AR模型的差距，并在7个基准测试中实现零样本泛化的SOTA性能，MAUVE分数首次超越AR模型。

Conclusion: ADLM通过锚点机制显著提升DLMs性能，理论推导的ANELBO目标证明锚点能改善样本复杂度和似然建模。锚点机制还可提升AR模型和数学逻辑任务的推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) promise parallel generation and
bidirectional context, yet they underperform autoregressive (AR) models in both
likelihood modeling and generated text quality. We identify that this
performance gap arises when important tokens (e.g., key words or low-frequency
words that anchor a sentence) are masked early in the forward process, limiting
contextual information for accurate reconstruction. To address this, we
introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage
framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor
network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the
anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and
OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap
with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in
zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in
MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text
than an AR model. Theoretically, we derive an Anchored Negative Evidence Lower
Bound (ANELBO) objective and show that anchoring improves sample complexity and
likelihood modeling. Beyond diffusion, anchoring boosts performance in AR
models and enhances reasoning in math and logic tasks, outperforming existing
chain-of-thought approaches

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估常忽略交叉性和文化特定偏见，尤其是在多语言和文化多样性地区。本研究旨在填补这一空白，特别关注南亚地区。

Method: 研究构建了一个基于文化的偏见词典，涵盖性别、宗教等交叉维度，并通过开放式生成任务（如讲故事、爱好等）量化偏见。同时评估了两种自去偏策略的效果。

Result: 研究发现LLM输出中确实存在文化偏见，尤其是在印度-雅利安和德拉威语言中。自去偏策略（简单和复杂提示）在一定程度上减少了这些偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究为文化偏见提供了新的分析视角，扩展了超越欧洲中心或小规模多语言环境的评估框架，并提出了有效的去偏方法。

Abstract: Evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) often overlook intersectional and
culturally specific biases, particularly in underrepresented multilingual
regions like South Asia. This work addresses these gaps by conducting a
multilingual and intersectional analysis of LLM outputs across 10 Indo-Aryan
and Dravidian languages, identifying how cultural stigmas influenced by purdah
and patriarchy are reinforced in generative tasks. We construct a culturally
grounded bias lexicon capturing previously unexplored intersectional dimensions
including gender, religion, marital status, and number of children. We use our
lexicon to quantify intersectional bias and the effectiveness of self-debiasing
in open-ended generations (e.g., storytelling, hobbies, and to-do lists), where
bias manifests subtly and remains largely unexamined in multilingual contexts.
Finally, we evaluate two self-debiasing strategies (simple and complex prompts)
to measure their effectiveness in reducing culturally specific bias in
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. Our approach offers a nuanced lens into
cultural bias by introducing a novel bias lexicon and evaluation framework that
extends beyond Eurocentric or small-scale multilingual settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely explored for automated scoring
in low-stakes assessment to facilitate learning and instruction. Empirical
evidence related to which LLM produces the most reliable scores and induces
least rater effects needs to be collected before the use of LLMs for automated

ChatGPT 4o, OpenAI o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini
2.0, as well as DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1) with human expert raters in
scoring two types of writing tasks. The accuracy of the holistic and analytic
scores from LLMs compared with human raters was evaluated in terms of Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. Intra-rater consistency across prompts was compared in terms of
Cronbach Alpha. Rater effects of LLMs were evaluated and compared with human
raters using the Many-Facet Rasch model. The results in general supported the
use of ChatGPT 4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet with high scoring
accuracy, better rater reliability, and less rater effects.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在训练过程中如何获得语用理解能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入ALTPRAG数据集，评估22个LLMs在不同训练阶段（预训练、监督微调、偏好优化）的语用能力。

Result: 基础模型已表现出对语用线索的敏感性，模型和数据规模的增加进一步提升了能力，SFT和RLHF对认知语用推理有额外贡献。

Conclusion: 语用能力是LLM训练中涌现的组合属性，为模型与人类交际规范对齐提供了新见解。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emerging capabilities
in social intelligence tasks, including implicature resolution (Sravanthi et
al. (2024)) and theory-of-mind reasoning (Shapira et al. (2024)), both of which
require substantial pragmatic understanding. However, how LLMs acquire this
competence throughout the training process remains poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce ALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of
alternatives, designed to evaluate whether LLMs at different training stages
can accurately infer nuanced speaker intentions. Each instance pairs two
contextually appropriate but pragmatically distinct continuations, enabling
fine-grained assessment of both pragmatic interpretation and contrastive
reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across key training stages:
pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference optimization, to
examine the development of pragmatic competence. Our results show that even
base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic cues, which improves
consistently with increases in model and data scale. Additionally, SFT and RLHF
contribute further gains, particularly in cognitive-pragmatic reasoning. These
findings highlight pragmatic competence as an emergent and compositional
property of LLM training and offer new insights for aligning models with human
communicative norms.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models represented by the Transformer have been proven
to possess strong base capabilities, and the representative self-attention
mechanism in the Transformer has become a classic in sequence modeling
architectures. Different from the work of proposing sequence modeling
architecture to improve the efficiency of attention mechanism, this work
focuses on the impact of sequence modeling architectures on base capabilities.
Specifically, our concern is: How exactly do sequence modeling architectures
affect the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we
first point out that the mixed domain pre-training setting commonly adopted in
existing architecture design works fails to adequately reveal the differences
in base capabilities among various architectures. To address this, we propose a
limited domain pre-training setting with out-of-distribution testing, which
successfully uncovers significant differences in base capabilities among
architectures at an early stage. Next, we analyze the base capabilities of
stateful sequence modeling architectures, and find that they exhibit
significant degradation in base capabilities compared to the Transformer. Then,
through a series of architecture component analysis, we summarize a key
architecture design principle: A sequence modeling architecture need possess
full-sequence arbitrary selection capability to avoid degradation in base
capabilities. Finally, we empirically validate this principle using an
extremely simple Top-1 element selection architecture and further generalize it
to a more practical Top-1 chunk selection architecture. Experimental results
demonstrate our proposed sequence modeling architecture design principle and
suggest that our work can serve as a valuable reference for future architecture
improvements and novel designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的优化器由人工设计，未针对特定任务优化，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出metaTextGrad，包含元提示优化器和元结构优化器两部分。

Conclusion: metaTextGrad能有效优化现有优化器，显著提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in learning algorithms,
evaluations, and optimization tasks. Recent studies have shown that using
LLM-based optimizers to automatically optimize model prompts, demonstrations,
predictions themselves, or other components can significantly enhance the
performance of AI systems, as demonstrated by frameworks such as DSPy and
TextGrad. However, optimizers built on language models themselves are usually
designed by humans with manual design choices; optimizers themselves are not
optimized. Moreover, these optimizers are general purpose by design, to be
useful to a broad audience, and are not tailored for specific tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose metaTextGrad, which focuses on designing a
meta-optimizer to further enhance existing optimizers and align them to be good
optimizers for a given task. Our approach consists of two key components: a
meta prompt optimizer and a meta structure optimizer. The combination of these
two significantly improves performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an
average absolute performance improvement of up to 6% compared to the best
baseline.

Abstract: Standing in 2025, at a critical juncture in the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has demonstrated
significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language
models (LLMs) and has led to the development of cutting-edge AI models such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, the efficient application of RFT to
enhance the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has attracted widespread attention from the community. In this position paper,
we argue that reinforcement fine-tuning powers the reasoning capability of
multimodal large language models. To begin with, we provide a detailed
introduction to the fundamental background knowledge that researchers
interested in this field should be familiar with. Furthermore, we meticulously
summarize the improvements of RFT in powering reasoning capability of MLLMs
into five key points: diverse modalities, diverse tasks and domains, better
training algorithms, abundant benchmarks and thriving engineering frameworks.
Finally, we propose five promising directions for future research that the
community might consider. We hope that this position paper will provide
valuable insights to the community at this pivotal stage in the advancement
toward AGI. Summary of works done on RFT for MLLMs is available at

Result: ExIde在规则提取和依赖分类任务上表现优异，验证了LLM在此类任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: ExIde为商业流程自动化提供了更自动化和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Process mining aims to discover, monitor and optimize the actual behaviors of
real processes. While prior work has mainly focused on extracting procedural
action flows from instructional texts, rule flows embedded in business
documents remain underexplored. To this end, we introduce a novel annotated
Chinese dataset, \textbf{BPRF}, which contains 50 business process documents
with 326 explicitly labeled business rules across multiple domains. Each rule
is represented as a <Condition, Action> pair, and we annotate logical
dependencies between rules (sequential, conditional, or parallel). We also
propose \textbf{ExIde}, a framework for automatic business rule extraction and
dependency relationship identification using large language models (LLMs). We
evaluate ExIde using 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the BPRF dataset,
benchmarking performance on both rule extraction and dependency classification
tasks of current LLMs. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ExIde in
extracting structured business rules and analyzing their interdependencies for
current SOTA LLMs, paving the way for more automated and interpretable business
process automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨提示自动作文评分方法需同时访问所有源提示数据，存在隐私问题且效果不佳。

Method: 提出源自由适应方法，通过线性组合任务向量模拟联合训练，采用PIM优化系数，结合贝叶斯优化。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集适应中均优于传统方法，鲁棒性强，计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时提升了跨提示评分的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in cross-prompt automated essay scoring (AES) typically train
models jointly on all source prompts, often requiring additional access to
unlabeled target prompt essays simultaneously. However, using all sources is
suboptimal in our pilot study, and re-accessing source datasets during
adaptation raises privacy concerns. We propose a source-free adaptation
approach that selectively merges individually trained source models' parameters
instead of datasets. In particular, we simulate joint training through linear
combinations of task vectors -- the parameter updates from fine-tuning. To
optimize the combination's coefficients, we propose Prior-encoded Information
Maximization (PIM), an unsupervised objective which promotes the model's score
discriminability regularized by priors pre-computed from the sources. We employ
Bayesian optimization as an efficient optimizer of PIM. Experimental results
with LLMs on in-dataset and cross-dataset adaptation show that our method (1)
consistently outperforms training jointly on all sources, (2) maintains
superior robustness compared to other merging methods, (3) excels under severe
distribution shifts where recent leading cross-prompt methods struggle, all
while retaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在推理过程中如何受错误信息影响，以及如何有效纠正这些错误，以提高其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过数学推理任务分析错误信息对LLMs中间推理步骤和最终答案的影响，并测试LLMs在明确指示下的纠正能力。

Result: LLMs在纠正错误信息时成功率低于50%，导致准确性显著下降（10.02% - 72.20%）。早期纠正和微调数据能有效减少错误传播。

Conclusion: 早期纠正和微调数据是减少LLMs错误信息传播的有效方法，为实际应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning, positioning them as promising tools for supporting human
problem-solving. However, what happens when their performance is affected by
misinformation, i.e., incorrect inputs introduced by users due to oversights or
gaps in knowledge? Such misinformation is prevalent in real-world interactions
with LLMs, yet how it propagates within LLMs' reasoning process remains
underexplored. Focusing on mathematical reasoning, we present a comprehensive
analysis of how misinformation affects intermediate reasoning steps and final
answers. We also examine how effectively LLMs can correct misinformation when
explicitly instructed to do so. Even with explicit instructions, LLMs succeed
less than half the time in rectifying misinformation, despite possessing
correct internal knowledge, leading to significant accuracy drops (10.02% -
72.20%). Further analysis shows that applying factual corrections early in the
reasoning process most effectively reduces misinformation propagation, and
fine-tuning on synthesized data with early-stage corrections significantly
improves reasoning factuality. Our work offers a practical approach to
mitigating misinformation propagation.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs安全机制中意图操纵的脆弱性，表明内容审核防护栏面临日益严峻的挑战。

Abstract: Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has
considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language
models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs'
moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level
jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious
manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the
vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit
implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based
prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful
inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into
declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback
loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive
experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate
that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak
methods and evades even advanced Intent Analysis (IA) and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-based defenses. Specifically, our "FSTR+SPIN" variant achieves attack
success rates ranging from 88.25% to 96.54% against CoT-based defenses on the
o1 model, and from 86.75% to 97.12% on the GPT-4o model under IA-based
defenses. These findings highlight a critical weakness in LLMs' safety
mechanisms and suggest that intent manipulation poses a growing challenge to
content moderation guardrails.

Abstract: High-quality instruction data is crucial for developing large language models

text, TAG-INSTRUCT compresses instructions into a compact tag space and

instruction complexity augmentation approaches. Our analysis reveals that
operating in tag space provides superior controllability and stability across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）在词联想层面表现出对西方文化的显著偏好，需要一种方法提升其跨文化认知对齐性。

Method: 提出CultureSteer方法，整合文化感知机制，引导语义表征向特定文化空间发展。

Result: 实验表明，CultureSteer显著改善了跨文化对齐性，优于基于提示的方法，并在文化敏感任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升LLM的文化意识提供了新方法，推动了更具包容性的语言技术的发展。

Abstract: The human-centered word association test (WAT) serves as a cognitive proxy,
revealing sociocultural variations through lexical-semantic patterns. We extend
this test into an LLM-adaptive, free-relation task to assess the alignment of
large language models (LLMs) with cross-cultural cognition. To mitigate the
culture preference, we propose CultureSteer, an innovative approach that
integrates a culture-aware steering mechanism to guide semantic representations
toward culturally specific spaces. Experiments show that current LLMs exhibit
significant bias toward Western cultural (notably in American) schemas at the
word association level. In contrast, our model substantially improves
cross-cultural alignment, surpassing prompt-based methods in capturing diverse
semantic associations. Further validation on culture-sensitive downstream tasks
confirms its efficacy in fostering cognitive alignment across cultures. This
work contributes a novel methodological paradigm for enhancing cultural
awareness in LLMs, advancing the development of more inclusive language
technologies.

Result: DRAG显著提高了检索可靠性，减少了幻觉，增强了事实准确性。

Conclusion: DRAG是一种无需训练的框架，能有效提升RAG的可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating
external knowledge, yet it introduces a critical issue: erroneous or biased
retrieval can mislead generation, compounding hallucinations, a phenomenon we
term Hallucination on Hallucination. To address this, we propose
Debate-Augmented RAG (DRAG), a training-free framework that integrates
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) mechanisms into both retrieval and generation stages.
In retrieval, DRAG employs structured debates among proponents, opponents, and
judges to refine retrieval quality and ensure factual reliability. In
generation, DRAG introduces asymmetric information roles and adversarial
debates, enhancing reasoning robustness and mitigating factual inconsistencies.
Evaluations across multiple tasks demonstrate that DRAG improves retrieval
reliability, reduces RAG-induced hallucinations, and significantly enhances
overall factual accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 尽管现有安全对齐方法取得进展，大型语言模型仍易受越狱攻击，且防御机制未能完全消除有害知识。

Method: CKU通过评分多层感知机（MLP）层的神经元，识别与有用知识相关的神经元子集U，并在消除过程中修剪U的梯度以保留有用知识。

Result: 实验表明，CKU显著提升了模型安全性，同时不影响整体性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CKU为安全对齐和知识编辑提供了新思路，同时分析了MLP层神经元的知识敏感性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in safety alignment, large language models
(LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms
have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to
bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning
(CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and
retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in
specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons
associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the
gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively
mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU
significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance,
offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing
methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across
various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety
alignment and model knowledge editing.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in digital platforms reveals the
limitations of traditional detection methods, which mostly rely on static
classification and fail to capture the intricate process of real-world
fact-checking. Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that
enhance automated reasoning, their application to misinformation detection
remains hindered by issues of logical inconsistency and superficial
verification. In response, we introduce Debate-to-Detect (D2D), a novel
Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) framework that reformulates misinformation detection
as a structured adversarial debate. Inspired by fact-checking workflows, D2D
assigns domain-specific profiles to each agent and orchestrates a five-stage
debate process, including Opening Statement, Rebuttal, Free Debate, Closing
Statement, and Judgment. To transcend traditional binary classification, D2D
introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanism that assesses each claim
across five distinct dimensions: Factuality, Source Reliability, Reasoning
Quality, Clarity, and Ethics. Experiments with GPT-4o on two fakenews datasets
demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, and the case study
highlight D2D's capability to iteratively refine evidence while improving
decision transparency, representing a substantial advancement towards robust
and interpretable misinformation detection. The code will be open-sourced in a
future release.

Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models
with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations.
While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e.,
LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual
annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data
and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we
propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages
minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple
modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured
textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making
patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with
images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being
trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively
trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in
modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce,
underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework
highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective
alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially
advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in developing reasoning-capable
Large Language Models (LLMs) through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.
However, this long-CoT reasoning process imposes substantial memory overhead
due to the large Key-Value (KV) Cache memory overhead. Post-training KV Cache
quantization has emerged as a promising compression technique and has been
extensively studied in short-context scenarios. However, directly applying
existing methods to long-CoT LLMs causes significant performance degradation
due to the following two reasons: (1) Large cumulative error: Existing methods
fail to adequately leverage available memory, and they directly quantize the KV
Cache during each decoding step, leading to large cumulative quantization
error. (2) Short-context calibration: Due to Rotary Positional Embedding
(RoPE), the use of short-context data during calibration fails to account for
the distribution of less frequent channels in the Key Cache, resulting in
performance loss. We propose Progressive Mixed-Precision KV Cache Quantization
(PM-KVQ) for long-CoT LLMs to address the above issues in two folds: (1) To
reduce cumulative error, we design a progressive quantization strategy to
gradually lower the bit-width of KV Cache in each block. Then, we propose
block-wise memory allocation to assign a higher bit-width to more sensitive
transformer blocks. (2) To increase the calibration length without additional
overhead, we propose a new calibration strategy with positional interpolation
that leverages short calibration data with positional interpolation to
approximate the data distribution of long-context data. Extensive experiments
on 7B-70B long-CoT LLMs show that PM-KVQ improves reasoning benchmark
performance by up to 8% over SOTA baselines under the same memory budget. Our

*Woohyun Cho,Youngmin Kim,Sunghyun Lee,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAVL是首个多语言、多模态的可唱歌词翻译基准，结合文本、音频和视频，提出SylAVL-CoT模型，显著优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 歌词翻译需兼顾语义准确性和音乐性，动画音乐剧的翻译还需对齐视听线索，现有方法难以满足。

Method: 提出SylAVL-CoT模型，利用音频视频线索并强制音节约束，生成自然的歌词。

Result: 实验显示SylAVL-CoT在可唱性和上下文准确性上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 多模态、多语言方法在歌词翻译中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation
of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals,
the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We
introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song
Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable
lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer
and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this,
we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought
SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints
to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that
SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and
contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual
approaches for lyrics translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DDO框架，通过多智能体协作优化医疗咨询中的症状询问和疾病诊断两个子任务，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法未能有效区分医疗咨询的双重任务（症状询问和疾病诊断），导致效果不佳。

Method: DDO框架通过多智能体协作，独立优化症状询问（序列决策）和疾病诊断（分类问题）。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上，DDO优于现有LLM方法，与最先进的生成方法竞争。

Conclusion: DDO框架有效解决了医疗咨询中的双重任务优化问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization and reasoning
abilities, making them well-suited for complex decision-making tasks such as
medical consultation (MC). However, existing LLM-based methods often fail to
capture the dual nature of MC, which entails two distinct sub-tasks: symptom
inquiry, a sequential decision-making process, and disease diagnosis, a
classification problem. This mismatch often results in ineffective symptom
inquiry and unreliable disease diagnosis. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DDO}, a novel LLM-based framework that performs
\textbf{D}ual-\textbf{D}ecision \textbf{O}ptimization by decoupling and
independently optimizing the the two sub-tasks through a collaborative
multi-agent workflow. Experiments on three real-world MC datasets show that DDO
consistently outperforms existing LLM-based approaches and achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art generation-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in the MC task.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决大语言模型在低资源语言（如Dzongkha）中表现不足的问题，并探索提升其性能的方法。

Method: 方法包括构建平行数据集DZEN，测试多种大语言模型在Dzongkha和英语中的表现，并分析不同提示策略（如Chain-of-Thought）的效果。

Result: 结果显示模型在英语和Dzongkha中表现差异显著，Chain-of-Thought提示对推理问题有效但对事实问题效果较差，添加英语翻译能提升Dzongkha问题的回答精度。

Conclusion: 结论指出该研究为提升大语言模型在低资源语言中的性能提供了新方向，并公开了数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we provide DZEN, a dataset of parallel Dzongkha and English
test questions for Bhutanese middle and high school students. The over 5K
questions in our collection span a variety of scientific topics and include
factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We use our parallel
dataset to test a number of Large Language Models (LLMs) and find a significant
performance difference between the models in English and Dzongkha. We also look
at different prompting strategies and discover that Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting works well for reasoning questions but less well for factual ones. We
also find that adding English translations enhances the precision of Dzongkha
question responses. Our results point to exciting avenues for further study to
improve LLM performance in Dzongkha and, more generally, in low-resource
languages. We release the dataset at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分块训练（CWT）和跳步思考训练（STT）方法，解决现有链式思维蒸馏中长推理导致的梯度平滑和响应慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法训练小语言模型（SLM）学习长推理链时，核心推理令牌的梯度被平滑，导致模型难以掌握推理逻辑，且响应速度慢。

Method: 提出分块训练（CWT），将推理链划分为语义连贯的块，每轮仅学习一个块；并在此基础上提出跳步思考训练（STT），自动跳过非推理块以加速推理。

Result: 在多种SLM和推理任务上验证了方法的有效性，提高了推理速度并保持准确性。

Conclusion: CWT和STT方法显著改善了SLM在推理任务中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation allows a large language model (LLM) to
guide a small language model (SLM) in reasoning tasks. Existing methods train
the SLM to learn the long rationale in one iteration, resulting in two issues:
1) Long rationales lead to a large token-level batch size during training,
making gradients of core reasoning tokens (i.e., the token will directly affect
the correctness of subsequent reasoning) over-smoothed as they contribute a
tiny fraction of the rationale. As a result, the SLM converges to sharp minima
where it fails to grasp the reasoning logic. 2) The response is slow, as the
SLM must generate a long rationale before reaching the answer. Therefore, we
propose chunk-wise training (CWT), which uses a heuristic search to divide the
rationale into internal semantically coherent chunks and focuses SLM on
learning from only one chunk per iteration. In this way, CWT naturally isolates
non-reasoning chunks that do not involve the core reasoning token (e.g.,
summary and transitional chunks) from the SLM learning for reasoning chunks,
making the fraction of the core reasoning token increase in the corresponding
iteration. Based on CWT, skip-thinking training (STT) is proposed. STT makes
the SLM automatically skip non-reasoning medium chunks to reach the answer,
improving reasoning speed while maintaining accuracy. We validate our approach
on a variety of SLMs and multiple reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Word2Vec和GloVe等模型生成的词向量中线性类比结构的理论起源，并提出了一种基于二进制语义属性的生成模型来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解词向量中线性类比结构的理论来源，并解释其在多种条件下的表现。

Method: 提出了一种基于二进制语义属性的生成模型，通过属性交互推导共现概率，从而分析线性类比结构的形成。

Result: 模型成功解释了线性类比结构的出现及其特性（如特征向量、对数变换、数据删除等），并与实际数据吻合。

Conclusion: 该生成模型为词向量中线性类比结构提供了理论支持，并揭示了其鲁棒性和维度扩展的作用。

Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the
co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The
resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also
exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} -
W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose
theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this
analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix
$M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more
eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are
included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and
(iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation
(e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these
phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are
defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are
derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces
the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties
(i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of
each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and
agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy
benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

settings, analyzing their strengths and limitations in the domain of climate
change.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising cornerstone for the
development of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence
(AI). However, ensuring the robustness of LLMs remains a critical challenge. To
address these challenges and advance the field, this survey provides a
comprehensive overview of current studies in this area. First, we
systematically examine the nature of robustness in LLMs, including its
conceptual foundations, the importance of consistent performance across diverse
inputs, and the implications of failure modes in real-world applications. Next,
we analyze the sources of non-robustness, categorizing intrinsic model
limitations, data-driven vulnerabilities, and external adversarial factors that
compromise reliability. Following this, we review state-of-the-art mitigation
strategies, and then we discuss widely adopted benchmarks, emerging metrics,
and persistent gaps in assessing real-world reliability. Finally, we synthesize
findings from existing surveys and interdisciplinary studies to highlight
trends, unresolved issues, and pathways for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了LLMs的跨语言弱点，并为针对性后训练提供了依据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in Natural
Language Processing (NLP), yet their cross-lingual performance consistency
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel methodology for
efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach
leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question
pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target
languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16
languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing
weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints
cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50\% accuracy drops in
target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments
investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual
weaknesses, revealing that linguistically related languages share similar
performance patterns and benefit from targeted post-training. Code is available

Conclusion: 系统能有效自动化分析研究框架，揭示了NLP研究中的趋势，如目标模糊化和科学探索优先于应用。

Abstract: Clarifying the research framing of NLP artefacts (e.g., models, datasets,
etc.) is crucial to aligning research with practical applications. Recent
studies manually analyzed NLP research across domains, showing that few papers
explicitly identify key stakeholders, intended uses, or appropriate contexts.
In this work, we propose to automate this analysis, developing a
three-component system that infers research framings by first extracting key
elements (means, ends, stakeholders), then linking them through interpretable
rules and contextual reasoning. We evaluate our approach on two domains:
automated fact-checking using an existing dataset, and hate speech detection
for which we annotate a new dataset-achieving consistent improvements over
strong LLM baselines. Finally, we apply our system to recent automated
fact-checking papers and uncover three notable trends: a rise in vague or
underspecified research goals, increased emphasis on scientific exploration
over application, and a shift toward supporting human fact-checkers rather than
pursuing full automation.

Motivation: 低资源语言在专业领域的机器翻译效果不佳，现有方法需要微调模型，对非技术用户和小型组织不实用。

Method: 结合神经机器翻译和基于大型语言模型的后期编辑，利用现有词汇表和翻译记忆库，通过开源平台实现协作式人机翻译。

Result: 在Tetun和Bislama的医疗与救灾翻译任务中，比基线系统提升16.90-22.41 ChrF++；在FLORES数据集的六种低资源语言上，平均比NLLB-54B提升2.8 ChrF。

Conclusion: Tulun通过协作式术语资源管理和人机结合方法，显著提升了低资源语言在专业领域的翻译效果。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) systems that support low-resource languages often
struggle on specialized domains. While researchers have proposed various
techniques for domain adaptation, these approaches typically require model
fine-tuning, making them impractical for non-technical users and small
organizations. To address this gap, we propose Tulun, a versatile solution for
terminology-aware translation, combining neural MT with large language model
(LLM)-based post-editing guided by existing glossaries and translation
memories. Our open-source web-based platform enables users to easily create,
edit, and leverage terminology resources, fostering a collaborative
human-machine translation process that respects and incorporates domain
expertise while increasing MT accuracy. Evaluations show effectiveness in both
real-world and benchmark scenarios: on medical and disaster relief translation
tasks for Tetun and Bislama, our system achieves improvements of 16.90-22.41
ChrF++ points over baseline MT systems. Across six low-resource languages on
the FLORES dataset, Tulun outperforms both standalone MT and LLM approaches,
achieving an average improvement of 2.8 ChrF points over NLLB-54B.

Conclusion: MM Health数据集旨在促进多模态层面的人类和机器生成内容的检测，支持健康场景下的虚假信息检测。

Abstract: Infodemics and health misinformation have significant negative impact on
individuals and society, exacerbating confusion and increasing hesitancy in
adopting recommended health measures. Recent advancements in generative AI,
capable of producing realistic, human like text and images, have significantly
accelerated the spread and expanded the reach of health misinformation,
resulting in an alarming surge in its dissemination. To combat the infodemics,
most existing work has focused on developing misinformation datasets from
social media and fact checking platforms, but has faced limitations in topical
coverage, inclusion of AI generation, and accessibility of raw content. To
address these issues, we present MM Health, a large scale multimodal
misinformation dataset in the health domain consisting of 34,746 news article
encompassing both textual and visual information. MM Health includes
human-generated multimodal information (5,776 articles) and AI generated
multimodal information (28,880 articles) from various SOTA generative AI
models. Additionally, We benchmarked our dataset against three tasks
(reliability checks, originality checks, and fine-grained AI detection)
demonstrating that existing SOTA models struggle to accurately distinguish the
reliability and origin of information. Our dataset aims to support the
development of misinformation detection across various health scenarios,
facilitating the detection of human and machine generated content at multimodal
levels.

Abstract: Machine learning models for text classification are trained to predict a
class for a given text. To do this, training and validation samples must be
prepared: a set of texts is collected, and each text is assigned a class. These
classes are usually assigned by human annotators with different expertise
levels, depending on the specific classification task. Collecting such samples
from scratch is labor-intensive because it requires finding specialists and
compensating them for their work; moreover, the number of available specialists
is limited, and their productivity is constrained by human factors. While it
may not be too resource-intensive to collect samples once, the ongoing need to
retrain models (especially in incremental learning pipelines) to address data
drift (also called model drift) makes the data collection process crucial and
costly over the model's entire lifecycle. This paper proposes several
approaches to replace human annotators with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
test classifier predictions for correctness, helping ensure model quality and
support high-quality incremental learning.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前知识编辑方法的局限性，凸显了基于上下文推理的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update the embedded knowledge within Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches, whether through parameter
modification or external memory integration, often suffer from inconsistent
evaluation objectives and experimental setups. To address this gap, we conduct
a comprehensive benchmarking study. In addition to fact-level datasets, we
introduce more complex event-based datasets and general-purpose datasets drawn
from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and
reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting
rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also
evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ
four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent
methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective
Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based
editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR
consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new
insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and
highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust
alternative.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Unified Opinion Concepts (UOC) ontology to
integrate opinions within their semantic context. The UOC ontology bridges the
gap between the semantic representation of opinion across different
formulations. It is a unified conceptualisation based on the facets of opinions
studied extensively in NLP and semantic structures described through symbolic
descriptions. We further propose the Unified Opinion Concept Extraction (UOCE)
task of extracting opinions from the text with enhanced expressivity.
Additionally, we provide a manually extended and re-annotated evaluation
dataset for this task and tailored evaluation metrics to assess the adherence
of extracted opinions to UOC semantics. Finally, we establish baseline
performance for the UOCE task using state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: GKI-ICD通过综合知识利用，有效提升了ICD编码任务的效果，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text
document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To
alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of
code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code
knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus
on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex
and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general
knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge,
namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized
design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above
knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively
enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular
ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics. Code is available

research is for the local language and this particular paper is on Sylheti

*Meng Li,Guangda Huzhang,Haibo Zhang,Xiting Wang,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输的令牌加权方案（OTPO），用于改进直接偏好优化（DPO），通过强调语义重要的令牌对，提升偏好优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法对所有令牌赋予相同重要性，而人类更关注有意义的部分，导致优化效果不佳。

Method: 引入上下文感知的令牌加权方案，通过最优传输方法强调重要令牌对，减少噪声影响。

Result: 实验验证OTPO能有效提升指令跟随能力，增强奖励稳定性和可解释性。

Conclusion: OTPO通过自适应加权优化偏好差异，显著提升了DPO框架的性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising framework for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences by directly
optimizing the log-likelihood difference between chosen and rejected responses.
However, existing methods assign equal importance to all tokens in the
response, while humans focus on more meaningful parts. This leads to suboptimal
preference optimization, as irrelevant or noisy tokens disproportionately
influence DPO loss. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{O}ptimal
\textbf{T}ransport-based token weighting scheme for enhancing direct
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (OTPO). By emphasizing semantically
meaningful token pairs and de-emphasizing less relevant ones, our method
introduces a context-aware token weighting scheme that yields a more
contrastive reward difference estimate. This adaptive weighting enhances reward
stability, improves interpretability, and ensures that preference optimization
focuses on meaningful differences between responses. Extensive experiments have
validated OTPO's effectiveness in improving instruction-following ability
across various settings\footnote{Code is available at
https://github.com/Mimasss2/OTPO.}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对复杂推理和链式思维分析的Text-to-SQL数据集LogicCat，填补了现有数据集在领域知识和数学推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL数据集多关注业务场景，缺乏领域知识和复杂推理能力，LogicCat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建包含4,038个问题和12,114个逐步推理注释的数据集，涵盖物理、算术、常识和假设推理。

Result: LogicCat显著提升了任务难度，最高执行准确率仅14.96%，加入链式思维注释后提升至33.96%。

Conclusion: LogicCat为推理驱动的Text-to-SQL研究提供了新挑战和机遇，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental task in natural language processing that seeks
to translate natural language questions into meaningful and executable SQL
queries. While existing datasets are extensive and primarily focus on business
scenarios and operational logic, they frequently lack coverage of
domain-specific knowledge and complex mathematical reasoning. To address this
gap, we present a novel dataset tailored for complex reasoning and
chain-of-thought analysis in SQL inference, encompassing physical, arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning. The dataset consists of 4,038 English
questions, each paired with a unique SQL query and accompanied by 12,114
step-by-step reasoning annotations, spanning 45 databases across diverse
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases
the difficulty for state-of-the-art models, with the highest execution accuracy
reaching only 14.96%. Incorporating our chain-of-thought annotations boosts
performance to 33.96%. Benchmarking leading public methods on Spider and BIRD
further underscores the unique challenges presented by LogicCat, highlighting
the significant opportunities for advancing research in robust,
reasoning-driven text-to-SQL systems. We have released our dataset code at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一框架，通过分析隐藏状态的可分离性和对齐性，揭示了大语言模型在上下文学习中的两阶段机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部机制，尤其是注意力头和任务向量如何共同作用。

Method: 通过几何因素（可分离性和对齐性）分析隐藏状态，并进行细粒度的逐层动态研究。

Result: 发现早期层实现可分离性，后期层实现对齐性，且特定注意力头和任务向量分别驱动这两阶段。

Conclusion: 统一了注意力头和任务向量的作用，为上下文学习的机制提供了新解释。

Abstract: The unusual properties of in-context learning (ICL) have prompted
investigations into the internal mechanisms of large language models. Prior
work typically focuses on either special attention heads or task vectors at
specific layers, but lacks a unified framework linking these components to the
evolution of hidden states across layers that ultimately produce the model's
output. In this paper, we propose such a framework for ICL in classification
tasks by analyzing two geometric factors that govern performance: the
separability and alignment of query hidden states. A fine-grained analysis of
layer-wise dynamics reveals a striking two-stage mechanism: separability
emerges in early layers, while alignment develops in later layers. Ablation
studies further show that Previous Token Heads drive separability, while
Induction Heads and task vectors enhance alignment. Our findings thus bridge
the gap between attention heads and task vectors, offering a unified account of
ICL's underlying mechanisms.

*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合欧氏距离与大语言模型（HED-LM）的少样本优化方法，用于提升传感器分类任务中的示例选择质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下效率高，但其性能依赖示例选择质量，HED-LM通过混合选择流程解决这一问题。

Method: HED-LM通过欧氏距离筛选候选示例，并利用大语言模型（LLMs）对上下文相关性重新排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM的F1分数为69.13±10.71%，优于随机选择（59.30±10.13%）和仅距离过滤（67.61±11.39%）。

Conclusion: HED-LM结合数值相似性与上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，适用于医疗监测、活动识别等场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在无关上下文干扰下的推理鲁棒性，并探索提升其性能的方法。

Method: 构建GSM-DC基准，注入精确干扰项，实验分析LLMs的敏感性，并提出训练和树搜索方法。

Result: LLMs对IC敏感，但训练和树搜索方法显著提升了其在分布内和分布外场景的性能。

Conclusion: GSM-DC为评估LLMs的推理鲁棒性提供了有效工具，训练和树搜索方法能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Grade School Math with Distracting Context (GSM-DC), a synthetic
benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning robustness
against systematically controlled irrelevant context (IC). GSM-DC constructs
symbolic reasoning graphs with precise distractor injections, enabling
rigorous, reproducible evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs are
significantly sensitive to IC, affecting both reasoning path selection and
arithmetic accuracy. Additionally, training models with strong distractors
improves performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
We further propose a stepwise tree search guided by a process reward model,
which notably enhances robustness in out-of-distribution conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEM领域等特定主题阅读需要背景知识，但缺乏自动化测量工具。

Method: 系统自动检测文本主题，生成相关词汇测试，评估学生知识状态。

Result: 系统能生成有效的背景知识测试，初步评估显示其可行性。

Conclusion: K-tool为自动化评估学生背景知识提供了实用工具，适用于中学英语母语学生。

Abstract: Background knowledge is typically needed for successful comprehension of
topical and domain specific reading passages, such as in the STEM domain.
However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be
readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given
student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this
paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for
generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge
related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a
given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship
with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background
knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and
words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the
topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help
determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on
their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and
high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to
handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text
collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an
initial evaluation of the system outputs.

TL;DR: DiKE提出了一种新方法，通过解耦知识表示来优化LLM的知识编辑，同时保留细粒度无关知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑LLM知识时无法保留与编辑知识共享主语但关系不同的细粒度无关知识，导致知识表示空间中的目标与无关知识纠缠。

Method: DiKE包含知识表示解耦模块（KRD）和解耦知识编辑模块（DKE），通过分解主语表示并仅更新目标相关部分，同时保留无关部分。

Result: 实验表明，DiKE显著提升了细粒度无关知识的保留能力，同时保持了编辑性能。

Conclusion: DiKE为LLM知识编辑提供了一种高效且最小侵入性的解决方案，解决了细粒度知识保留的挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently
updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing
approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and
preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain
fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited
knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because
subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the
target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the
representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during
editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles
Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key
components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that
decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and
-unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module
that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the
unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based
on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To
rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we
construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant
knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially
improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining
competitive general editing performance.

Conclusion: ALPS为高效LLM对齐提供了新视角，兼具性能提升和成本降低。

Abstract: Aligning general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks
often incurs significant costs, including constructing task-specific
instruction pairs and extensive training adjustments. Prior research has
explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through
minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention
heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which
hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model
alignment efficiency, we propose the \textit{\textbf{A}ttention
\textbf{L}ocalization and \textbf{P}runing \textbf{S}trategy (\textbf{ALPS})},
an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads
and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby
reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
activates only \textbf{10\%} of attention parameters during fine-tuning while
achieving a \textbf{2\%} performance improvement over baselines on three tasks.
Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets
and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel
perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: v1是一种轻量级扩展，通过动态视觉检索增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，显著提升需要细粒度视觉参考和多步推理的任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型通常仅一次性处理视觉输入，缺乏动态视觉访问能力，限制了其在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: v1引入简单的点选复制机制，允许模型在推理过程中动态检索相关图像区域，并通过v1g数据集（30万条多模态推理轨迹）训练此能力。

Result: 在MathVista、MathVision和MathVerse三个多模态数学推理基准测试中，v1表现优于基线模型，尤其在需要细粒度视觉参考的任务中。

Conclusion: 动态视觉访问是提升多模态推理能力的有效方向，未来研究可通过代码、模型和数据进一步探索。

Abstract: We present v1, a lightweight extension to Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) that enables selective visual revisitation during inference. While
current MLLMs typically consume visual input only once and reason purely over
internal memory, v1 introduces a simple point-and-copy mechanism that allows
the model to dynamically retrieve relevant image regions throughout the
reasoning process. This mechanism augments existing architectures with minimal
modifications, enabling contextual access to visual tokens based on the model's
evolving hypotheses. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of
300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations.
Experiments on three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks -- MathVista,
MathVision, and MathVerse -- demonstrate that v1 consistently improves
performance over comparable baselines, particularly on tasks requiring
fine-grained visual reference and multi-step reasoning. Our results suggest
that dynamic visual access is a promising direction for enhancing grounded
multimodal reasoning. Code, models, and data will be released to support future
research.

Result: 强调了心理理论（ToM）对智能MPCAs的重要性，并指出多模态理解是未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 为未来研究者提供了开发更强大MPCAs的指导。

Abstract: Multi-party Conversational Agents (MPCAs) are systems designed to engage in
dialogue with more than two participants simultaneously. Unlike traditional
two-party agents, designing MPCAs faces additional challenges due to the need
to interpret both utterance semantics and social dynamics. This survey explores
recent progress in MPCAs by addressing three key questions: 1) Can agents model
each participants' mental states? (State of Mind Modeling); 2) Can they
properly understand the dialogue content? (Semantic Understanding); and 3) Can
they reason about and predict future conversation flow? (Agent Action
Modeling). We review methods ranging from classical machine learning to Large
Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal systems. Our analysis underscores Theory
of Mind (ToM) as essential for building intelligent MPCAs and highlights
multi-modal understanding as a promising yet underexplored direction. Finally,
this survey offers guidance to future researchers on developing more capable
MPCAs.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本生成中面临离散性和语义保留的挑战，需要一种兼顾两者的方法。

Method: 提出Smoothie方法，基于语义相似性逐步平滑token嵌入，实现信息渐进移除并保持自然解码。

Result: 实验表明Smoothie在多个序列生成任务中优于现有扩散模型，且其扩散空间表现优于标准嵌入空间和分类单纯形。

Conclusion: Smoothie通过结合连续和离散方法的优势，显著提升了文本生成的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating
images, audio, and video, but their adaptation to text remains challenging due
to its discrete nature. Prior approaches either apply Gaussian diffusion in
continuous latent spaces, which inherits semantic structure but struggles with
token decoding, or operate in categorical simplex space, which respect
discreteness but disregard semantic relation between tokens. In this paper, we
propose Smoothing Diffusion on Token Embeddings (Smoothie), a novel diffusion
method that combines the strengths of both approaches by progressively
smoothing token embeddings based on semantic similarity. This technique enables
gradual information removal while maintaining a natural decoding process.
Experimental results on several sequence-to-sequence generation tasks
demonstrate that Smoothie outperforms existing diffusion-based models in
generation quality. Furthermore, ablation studies show that our proposed
diffusion space yields better performance than both the standard embedding
space and the categorical simplex. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ashaba1in/smoothie.

Conclusion: RePA框架通过自适应模仿和分段模仿，有效解决了说明文生成任务中的挑战，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Exemplar-Based Expository Text Generation task, aiming to
generate an expository text on a new topic using an exemplar on a similar
topic. Current methods fall short due to their reliance on extensive exemplar
data, difficulty in adapting topic-specific content, and issues with long-text
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose the concept of Adaptive
Imitation and present a novel Recurrent Plan-then-Adapt (RePA) framework. RePA
leverages large language models (LLMs) for effective adaptive imitation through
a fine-grained plan-then-adapt process. RePA also enables recurrent
segment-by-segment imitation, supported by two memory structures that enhance
input clarity and output coherence. We also develop task-specific evaluation
metrics--imitativeness, adaptiveness, and adaptive-imitativeness--using LLMs as
evaluators. Experimental results across our collected three diverse datasets
demonstrate that RePA surpasses existing baselines in producing factual,
consistent, and relevant texts for this task.

Method: 提出了一种基于语音令牌化的令牌级攻击方法，生成对抗性令牌序列并合成为音频提示，以绕过对齐防护。

Result: 在SpeechGPT上评估，攻击成功率高达89%，显著优于现有语音攻击方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语音多模态系统的脆弱性，为下一代更鲁棒的MLLMs开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced the naturalness and flexibility of human computer
interaction by enabling seamless understanding across text, vision, and audio
modalities. Among these, voice enabled models such as SpeechGPT have
demonstrated considerable improvements in usability, offering expressive, and
emotionally responsive interactions that foster deeper connections in real
world communication scenarios. However, the use of voice introduces new
security risks, as attackers can exploit the unique characteristics of spoken
language, such as timing, pronunciation variability, and speech to text
translation, to craft inputs that bypass defenses in ways not seen in
text-based systems. Despite substantial research on text based jailbreaks, the
voice modality remains largely underexplored in terms of both attack strategies
and defense mechanisms. In this work, we present an adversarial attack
targeting the speech input of aligned MLLMs in a white box scenario.
Specifically, we introduce a novel token level attack that leverages access to
the model's speech tokenization to generate adversarial token sequences. These
sequences are then synthesized into audio prompts, which effectively bypass
alignment safeguards and to induce prohibited outputs. Evaluated on SpeechGPT,
our approach achieves up to 89 percent attack success rate across multiple
restricted tasks, significantly outperforming existing voice based jailbreak
methods. Our findings shed light on the vulnerabilities of voice-enabled
multimodal systems and to help guide the development of more robust
next-generation MLLMs.

Conclusion: Sci-LoRA 为跨领域科学信息的通俗化转述提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Lay paraphrasing aims to make scientific information accessible to audiences
without technical backgrounds. However, most existing studies focus on a single
domain, such as biomedicine. With the rise of interdisciplinary research, it is
increasingly necessary to comprehend knowledge spanning multiple technical
fields. To address this, we propose Sci-LoRA, a model that leverages a mixture
of LoRAs fine-tuned on multiple scientific domains. In particular, Sci-LoRA
dynamically generates and applies weights for each LoRA, enabling it to adjust
the impact of different domains based on the input text, without requiring
explicit domain labels. To balance domain-specific knowledge and generalization
across various domains, Sci-LoRA integrates information at both the data and
model levels. This dynamic fusion enhances the adaptability and performance
across various domains. Experimental results across twelve domains on five
public datasets show that Sci-LoRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
large language models and demonstrates flexible generalization and adaptability
in cross-domain lay paraphrasing.

in their environments, data, and agent-user interactions, with limited coverage
of diverse business scenarios and industries. To address these gaps, we
introduce CRMArena-Pro, a novel benchmark for holistic, realistic assessment of
LLM agents in diverse professional settings. CRMArena-Pro expands on CRMArena
with nineteen expert-validated tasks across sales, service, and 'configure,
price, and quote' processes, for both Business-to-Business and
Business-to-Customer scenarios. It distinctively incorporates multi-turn
interactions guided by diverse personas and robust confidentiality awareness
assessments. Experiments reveal leading LLM agents achieve only around 58%
single-turn success on CRMArena-Pro, with performance dropping significantly to
approximately 35% in multi-turn settings. While Workflow Execution proves more
tractable for top agents (over 83% single-turn success), other evaluated
business skills present greater challenges. Furthermore, agents exhibit
near-zero inherent confidentiality awareness; though targeted prompting can
improve this, it often compromises task performance. These findings highlight a
substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and enterprise demands,
underscoring the need for advancements in multi-turn reasoning, confidentiality
adherence, and versatile skill acquisition.

Conclusion: 通过多模态数据和词级标注方法，为幽默检测任务提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Aiming towards improving current computational models of humor detection, we
propose a new multimodal dataset of stand-up comedies, in seven languages:
English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian and Czech. Our dataset
of more than 330 hours, is at the time of writing the biggest available for
this type of task, and the most diverse. The whole dataset is automatically
annotated in laughter (from the audience), and the subpart left for model
validation is manually annotated. Contrary to contemporary approaches, we do
not frame the task of humor detection as a binary sequence classification, but
as word-level sequence labeling, in order to take into account all the context
of the sequence and to capture the continuous joke tagging mechanism typically
occurring in natural conversations. As par with unimodal baselines results, we

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗、金融等隐私敏感领域的应用增加，需要一种既能保护数据隐私又能提高模型准确性的方法。

Method: 采用Kitchenham的指南进行系统性文献综述，分析2020至2025年的研究，分类研究重点、贡献类型和应用领域。

Result: 总结了快速发展的研究领域，识别了常见设计模式，并提出了隐私保护检索、跨客户端异质性等关键挑战。

Conclusion: Federated RAG为RAG与联邦系统的结合提供了研究基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Federated RAG) combines Federated
Learning (FL), which enables distributed model training without exposing raw
data, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the factual
accuracy of language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge. As
large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains
such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers
a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language
processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published
between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based
software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research
focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural
patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving
retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings
synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design
patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at
the intersection of RAG and federated systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台的评论骚扰问题日益严重，影响用户体验和健康，研究旨在评估大语言模型在内容审核中的效果。

Method: 使用统一提示和确定性设置，对5080条YouTube评论（含1334条有害评论）进行测试，涵盖英语、阿拉伯语和印尼语。

Result: GPT-4.1综合表现最佳（F1=0.863），Gemini召回率最高（0.875），Claude精确度最高（0.920）。

Conclusion: 需结合多种模型、上下文和针对性优化以提升审核效果，数据集已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that
undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading
large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic
Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse
threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset
comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and
Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement
(Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings,
GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision
of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful
posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false
positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest
false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative
analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and
mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation
pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational
context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A
de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to
promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaMind是一个多智能体框架，通过模拟人类心理理论（ToM）提升大型语言模型（LLM）在社交推理中的表现，实现了35.7%的社交场景性能提升和6.2%的ToM推理提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在理解人类社交意图、情感和信念方面存在不足，无法处理模糊性和上下文细微差别，MetaMind旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MetaMind分为三个阶段：心理理论代理生成假设，领域代理基于文化和伦理约束优化假设，响应代理生成并验证上下文合适的回应。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，首次让LLM在关键ToM任务上达到人类水平。

Conclusion: MetaMind推动了AI向人类社交智能迈进，适用于共情对话和文化敏感交互。

Abstract: Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken
intentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the
psychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models
(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity
and contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories
of metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind
decomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a
Theory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses user mental states (e.g., intent,
emotion), (2) a Domain Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural norms and
ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually
appropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging
benchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain
in ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on
key ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all
components, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual
plausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation. This work advances
AI systems toward human-like social intelligence, with applications in
empathetic dialogue and culturally sensitive interactions. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，指令调优的大型语言模型（LLMs）使用结构化模板会导致多样性崩溃，限制了输出的创造性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨结构化模板对LLMs输出多样性的影响，揭示当前提示设计的局限性。

Method: 通过系统评估不同任务（如故事完成和自由生成），分析结构化模板对输出多样性的影响，并比较不同提示设计的效果。

Result: 结构化模板显著限制了输出多样性，而格式一致性对结构敏感任务至关重要，但对知识密集型任务影响较小。

Conclusion: 当前提示设计可能抑制输出多样性，需要开发多样性感知的提示设计和指令调优方法。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates,
such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during
inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it
induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates
semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and
variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story
completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse
persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in
templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize
these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts
and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance,
alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format
consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for
structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on
knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity
is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with
minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal
that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may
inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for
diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning.

Motivation: 现有MMLU基准主要关注高资源语言（如英语），而低资源语言（如孟加拉语）代表性不足。

Method: 构建了包含23个领域的138,949个多选题对的BnMMLU数据集，并评估了多个专有和开源大语言模型。

Result: 结果显示模型在孟加拉语任务中存在显著性能差距，需改进预训练和微调策略。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和基准结果以促进孟加拉语语言模型的进一步研究。

Abstract: The Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark has been widely
used to evaluate language models across various domains. However, existing MMLU
datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English, which
leaves low-resource languages like Bengali underrepresented. In this paper, we
introduce BnMMLU, a benchmark to evaluate the multitask language understanding
capabilities of Bengali in language models. The dataset spans 23 domains,
including science, humanities, mathematics and general knowledge and is
structured in a multiple-choice format to assess factual knowledge,
application-based problem-solving and reasoning abilities of language models.
It consists of 138,949 question-option pairs. We benchmark several proprietary
and open-source large language models (LLMs) on the BnMMLU test set.
Additionally, we annotate the test set with three cognitive categories-factual
knowledge, procedural application and reasoning-to gain deeper insights into
model strengths and weaknesses across various cognitive tasks. The results
reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting the need for improved
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies tailored to Bengali data. We release
the dataset and benchmark results to facilitate further research in this area.

Result: 模型间评分分布和人口统计敏感性差异显著，无模型在所有地区和人口统计中表现一致。

Conclusion: 需建立严格的标准化评估体系，以减少AI在金融应用中的偏见和不一致性。

Abstract: We evaluate the credibility of leading AI models in assessing investment risk
appetite. Our analysis spans proprietary (GPT-4, Claude 3.7, Gemini 1.5) and
open-weight models (LLaMA 3.1/3.3, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral-small), using 1,720
user profiles constructed with 16 risk-relevant features across 10 countries
and both genders. We observe significant variance across models in score
distributions and demographic sensitivity. For example, GPT-4o assigns higher
risk scores to Nigerian and Indonesian profiles, while LLaMA and DeepSeek show
opposite gender tendencies in risk classification. While some models (e.g.,
GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1) align closely with expected scores in low- and mid-risk
ranges, none maintain consistent performance across regions and demographics.
Our findings highlight the need for rigorous, standardized evaluations of AI
systems in regulated financial contexts to prevent bias, opacity, and
inconsistency in real-world deployment.

TL;DR: System-1.5 Reasoning是一种自适应推理框架，通过动态分配计算资源在推理步骤中提高效率，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chain-of-thought (CoT)推理效率低下，而现有的潜在空间推理方法未能区分关键步骤与非关键步骤，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出System-1.5 Reasoning框架，包含两种动态捷径：模型深度捷径（DS）和步骤捷径（SS），并通过两阶段自蒸馏训练实现。

Result: 在GSM8K等推理任务中，性能与传统CoT方法相当，但推理速度提升20倍以上，token生成减少92.31%。

Conclusion: System-1.5 Reasoning显著提升了推理效率，同时保持了高性能，为LLMs的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to move
beyond fast System-1 responses and engage in deliberative System-2 reasoning.
However, this comes at the cost of significant inefficiency due to verbose
intermediate output. Recent latent-space reasoning methods improve efficiency
by operating on hidden states without decoding into language, yet they treat
all steps uniformly, failing to distinguish critical deductions from auxiliary
steps and resulting in suboptimal use of computational resources. In this
paper, we propose System-1.5 Reasoning, an adaptive reasoning framework that
dynamically allocates computation across reasoning steps through shortcut paths
in latent space.Specifically, System-1.5 Reasoning introduces two types of
dynamic shortcuts. The model depth shortcut (DS) adaptively reasons along the
vertical depth by early exiting non-critical tokens through lightweight adapter
branches, while allowing critical tokens to continue through deeper Transformer
layers. The step shortcut (SS) reuses hidden states across the decoding steps
to skip trivial steps and reason horizontally in latent space. Training
System-1.5 Reasoning involves a two-stage self-distillation process: first
distilling natural language CoT into latent-space continuous thought, and then
distilling full-path System-2 latent reasoning into adaptive shortcut paths
(System-1.5 Reasoning).Experiments on reasoning tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our method. For example, on GSM8K, System-1.5 Reasoning achieves
reasoning performance comparable to traditional CoT fine-tuning methods while
accelerating inference by over 20x and reducing token generation by 92.31% on
average.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的决策过程不透明，现有解释方法要么不够忠实，要么难以理解。

Method: 训练一个可解释的代理模型，利用句子级原型作为人类可理解的概念。

Result: ProtoSurE在多种模型和数据集上优于现有方法，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: ProtoSurE是一种实用且高效的解释框架，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely
opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to
the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to
understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel
prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and
human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an
interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while
utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation
methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates
strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve
good performance, making it practical for real-world applications.

Motivation: 探索简单实值嵌入模型在知识图谱补全中的有效性，提出一种可解释且模块化的方法。

Method: 采用实值相位-模分解，利用正弦相位对齐编码对称、反转和组合等关系模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如YAGO3-10的MRR为0.521，Hit@10为0.680，效率提升显著。

Conclusion: RelatE是知识图谱补全中可扩展且可解释的替代方案，优于复杂架构。

Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of simple, real-valued embedding models for knowledge
graph completion and introduce RelatE, an interpretable and modular method that
efficiently integrates dual representations for entities and relations. RelatE
employs a real-valued phase-modulus decomposition, leveraging sinusoidal phase
alignments to encode relational patterns such as symmetry, inversion, and
composition. In contrast to recent approaches based on complex-valued
embeddings or deep neural architectures, RelatE preserves architectural
simplicity while achieving competitive or superior performance on standard
benchmarks. Empirically, RelatE outperforms prior methods across several
datasets: on YAGO3-10, it achieves an MRR of 0.521 and Hit@10 of 0.680,
surpassing all baselines. Additionally, RelatE offers significant efficiency
gains, reducing training time by 24%, inference latency by 31%, and peak GPU
memory usage by 22% compared to RotatE. Perturbation studies demonstrate
improved robustness, with MRR degradation reduced by up to 61% relative to
TransE and by up to 19% compared to RotatE under structural edits such as edge
removals and relation swaps. Formal analysis further establishes the model's
full expressiveness and its capacity to represent essential first-order logical
inference patterns. These results position RelatE as a scalable and
interpretable alternative to more complex architectures for knowledge graph
completion.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Mamba (HiM)的模型，结合Mamba2和双曲几何，用于学习层次感知的语言嵌入，以提升复杂层次推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型主要依赖平坦的欧几里得嵌入，限制了其对潜在层次结构的捕捉能力，因此需要一种能够更好地表示语言层次结构的方法。

Method: HiM将高效的Mamba2与双曲几何（如Poincare球和Lorentzian流形）结合，通过可学习的曲率和双曲损失优化，学习层次感知的嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，HiM在四个语言和医学数据集上均优于欧几里得基线模型，能够有效捕捉层次关系，其中HiM-Poincare在语义区分上表现更好，HiM-Lorentz则更稳定和紧凑。

Conclusion: HiM通过结合双曲几何和Mamba2，显著提升了层次推理任务的表现，为复杂语言理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Selective state-space models have achieved great success in long-sequence
modeling. However, their capacity for language representation, especially in
complex hierarchical reasoning tasks, remains underexplored. Most large
language models rely on flat Euclidean embeddings, limiting their ability to
capture latent hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical
Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved
nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for
deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to
the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via
cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a
combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational
distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range
reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and
multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with
four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop
inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models
effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets,
surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic
distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable,
compact, and hierarchy-preserving embeddings favoring robustness over detail.

4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under
four configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and

over 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most

*Yunxin Li,Xinyu Chen,Zitao Li,Zhenyu Liu,Longyue Wang,Wenhan Luo,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VerIPO方法，通过验证器引导的迭代策略优化，提升视频大语言模型的长链推理能力，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化微调方法（如GRPO）在数据准备和长链推理质量上存在瓶颈，需改进。

Method: 提出GRPO-Verifier-DPO训练循环，利用小型LLM验证器评估推理逻辑，构建高质量对比数据。

Result: 实验显示VerIPO优化更快、效果更好，生成的长链推理更一致，性能优于其他模型。

Conclusion: VerIPO方法在视频推理任务中表现出高效性和稳定性，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) shows significant promise for complex video reasoning. However,
popular Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods, such as outcome-based Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are limited by data preparation
bottlenecks (e.g., noise or high cost) and exhibit unstable improvements in the
quality of long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) and downstream performance.To address
these limitations, we propose VerIPO, a Verifier-guided Iterative Policy
Optimization method designed to gradually improve video LLMs' capacity for
generating deep, long-term reasoning chains. The core component is
Rollout-Aware Verifier, positioned between the GRPO and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) training phases to form the GRPO-Verifier-DPO training loop.
This verifier leverages small LLMs as a judge to assess the reasoning logic of
rollouts, enabling the construction of high-quality contrastive data, including
reflective and contextually consistent CoTs. These curated preference samples
drive the efficient DPO stage (7x faster than GRPO), leading to marked
improvements in reasoning chain quality, especially in terms of length and
contextual consistency. This training loop benefits from GRPO's expansive
search and DPO's targeted optimization. Experimental results demonstrate: 1)
Significantly faster and more effective optimization compared to standard GRPO
variants, yielding superior performance; 2) Our trained models exceed the
direct inference of large-scale instruction-tuned Video-LLMs, producing long
and contextually consistent CoTs on diverse video reasoning tasks; and 3) Our
model with one iteration outperforms powerful LMMs (e.g., Kimi-VL) and long
reasoning models (e.g., Video-R1), highlighting its effectiveness and
stability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CrosGrpsABS的混合框架，通过双向交叉注意力结合句法和语义图，提升低资源语言（如孟加拉语）的方面级情感分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于资源丰富的语言（如英语），而低资源语言（如孟加拉语）缺乏标注数据、预训练模型和优化超参数，导致其ABSA任务研究不足。

Method: CrosGrpsABS结合了基于Transformer的上下文嵌入和图卷积网络，利用规则化句法依赖解析和语义相似度计算，通过双向交叉注意力融合局部句法结构和全局语义上下文。

Result: 在孟加拉语ABSA数据集和英语SemEval 2014 Task 4数据集上，CrosGrpsABS表现优于现有方法，F1分数分别提升了0.93%（餐厅领域）和1.06%（笔记本电脑领域）。

Conclusion: CrosGrpsABS通过融合句法和语义信息，显著提升了低资源语言的ABSA性能，为类似语言的类似任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural
language processing, offering fine-grained insights into opinions expressed in
text. While existing research has largely focused on resource-rich languages
like English which leveraging large annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and
language-specific tools. These resources are often unavailable for low-resource
languages such as Bengali. The ABSA task in Bengali remains poorly explored and
is further complicated by its unique linguistic characteristics and a lack of
annotated data, pre-trained models, and optimized hyperparameters. To address
these challenges, this research propose CrosGrpsABS, a novel hybrid framework
that leverages bidirectional cross-attention between syntactic and semantic
graphs to enhance aspect-level sentiment classification. The CrosGrpsABS
combines transformerbased contextual embeddings with graph convolutional
networks, built upon rule-based syntactic dependency parsing and semantic
similarity computations. By employing bidirectional crossattention, the model
effectively fuses local syntactic structure with global semantic context,
resulting in improved sentiment classification performance across both low- and
high-resource settings. We evaluate CrosGrpsABS on four low-resource Bengali
ABSA datasets and the high-resource English SemEval 2014 Task 4 dataset. The
CrosGrpsABS consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving notable
improvements, including a 0.93% F1-score increase for the Restaurant domain and
a 1.06% gain for the Laptop domain in the SemEval 2014 Task 4 benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效的数据选择对现代大语言模型训练至关重要，传统方法难以兼顾性能和计算成本。

Method: 利用二阶信息计算样本对目标分布的影响力，提出基于地标样本的近似方法以降低计算成本。

Result: 在Tulu V2数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优于或匹配现有技术，同时选择速度提升3.5倍。

Conclusion: 影响力蒸馏为LLM数据选择提供了高效且数学可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective data selection is critical for efficient training of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Influence Distillation, a novel,
mathematically-justified framework for data selection that employs second-order
information to optimally weight training samples. By distilling each sample's
influence on a target distribution, our method assigns model-specific weights
that are used to select training data for LLM fine-tuning, guiding it toward
strong performance on the target domain. We derive these optimal weights for
both Gradient Descent and Adam optimizers. To ensure scalability and reduce
computational cost, we propose a $\textit{landmark-based approximation}$:
influence is precisely computed for a small subset of "landmark" samples and
then efficiently propagated to all other samples to determine their weights. We
validate Influence Distillation by applying it to instruction tuning on the
Tulu V2 dataset, targeting a range of tasks including GSM8k, SQuAD, and MMLU,
across several models from the Llama and Qwen families. Experiments show that
Influence Distillation matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance
while achieving up to $3.5\times$ faster selection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种防御方法，通过扩展拒绝数据集和微调模型，有效抵御了针对大语言模型的abliteration攻击，同时保持了模型的安全性和通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对abliteration攻击导致模型生成不道德内容的问题，研究如何增强模型的安全防御能力。

Method: 构建扩展拒绝数据集，包含有害提示和完整拒绝理由，并微调Llama-2-7B-Chat和Qwen2.5-Instruct模型。

Result: 扩展拒绝模型在abliteration攻击下拒绝率仅下降10%，而基线模型下降70-80%，且安全性评估表现良好。

Conclusion: 扩展拒绝微调能有效抵御abliteration攻击，同时保持模型的通用性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to comply with safety
guidelines by refusing harmful instructions. A recent attack, termed
abliteration, isolates and suppresses the single latent direction most
responsible for refusal behavior, enabling the model to generate unethical
content. We propose a defense that modifies how models generate refusals. We
construct an extended-refusal dataset that contains harmful prompts with a full
response that justifies the reason for refusal. We then fine-tune
Llama-2-7B-Chat and Qwen2.5-Instruct (1.5B and 3B parameters) on our
extended-refusal dataset, and evaluate the resulting systems on a set of
harmful prompts. In our experiments, extended-refusal models maintain high
refusal rates, dropping at most by 10%, whereas baseline models' refusal rates
drop by 70-80% after abliteration. A broad evaluation of safety and utility
shows that extended-refusal fine-tuning neutralizes the abliteration attack
while preserving general performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法依赖标记概率，导致输出长度引入偏差，即使长度归一化方法仍存在此问题。

Method: 提出UNCERTAINTY-LINE方法，通过回归不确定性分数与输出长度，利用残差作为修正后的长度不变估计。

Result: 在机器翻译、摘要和问答任务中，UNCERTAINTY-LINE优于现有长度归一化方法。

Conclusion: UNCERTAINTY-LINE是一种模型无关的后处理方法，能有效消除长度偏差，提升不确定性量化准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools across various
applications, making it more important than ever to ensure the quality and the
trustworthiness of their outputs. This has led to growing interest in
uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for assessing the reliability of LLM
outputs. Many existing UQ techniques rely on token probabilities, which
inadvertently introduces a bias with respect to the length of the output. While
some methods attempt to account for this, we demonstrate that such biases
persist even in length-normalized approaches. To address the problem, here we
propose UNCERTAINTY-LINE: (Length-INvariant Estimation), a simple debiasing
procedure that regresses uncertainty scores on output length and uses the
residuals as corrected, length-invariant estimates. Our method is post-hoc,
model-agnostic, and applicable to a range of UQ measures. Through extensive
evaluation on machine translation, summarization, and question-answering tasks,
we demonstrate that UNCERTAINTY-LINE: consistently improves over even nominally
length-normalized UQ methods uncertainty estimates across multiple metrics and
models.

Motivation: 现有方法在不确定性估计中存在平衡、校准等问题，阻碍其广泛应用。

Method: 提出CUE方法，利用与目标LLM性能对齐的数据训练轻量级模型，调整不确定性分数。

Result: 实验表明，CUE在多种模型和任务中表现优异，提升幅度高达60%。

Conclusion: CUE是一种简单有效的方法，显著改进了LLM不确定性估计的准确性。

Abstract: To facilitate robust and trustworthy deployment of large language models
(LLMs), it is essential to quantify the reliability of their generations
through uncertainty estimation. While recent efforts have made significant
advancements by leveraging the internal logic and linguistic features of LLMs
to estimate uncertainty scores, our empirical analysis highlights the pitfalls
of these methods to strike a harmonized estimation between indication, balance,
and calibration, which hinders their broader capability for accurate
uncertainty estimation. To address this challenge, we propose CUE (Corrector
for Uncertainty Estimation): A straightforward yet effective method that
employs a lightweight model trained on data aligned with the target LLM's
performance to adjust uncertainty scores. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse models and tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, which achieves
consistent improvements of up to 60% over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注视觉理解，缺乏对VLMs在文本丰富图像中阅读和推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 将纯文本基准测试的上下文转换为文本图像，保持文本提示和问题不变，构建ReadBench。

Result: VLMs在短文本图像输入中表现略有下降，而在长文本多页上下文中表现急剧下降；文本分辨率对性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ReadBench揭示了VLMs在处理视觉呈现的长文本内容时的不足，强调了改进方向，尤其是实际应用中的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have greatly
enhanced their capability to jointly process text and images. However, despite
extensive benchmarks evaluating visual comprehension (e.g., diagrams, color
schemes, OCR tasks...), there is limited assessment of VLMs' ability to read
and reason about text-rich images effectively. To fill this gap, we introduce
ReadBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the reading
comprehension capabilities of VLMs. ReadBench transposes contexts from
established text-only benchmarks into images of text while keeping textual
prompts and questions intact. Evaluating leading VLMs with ReadBench, we find
minimal-but-present performance degradation on short, text-image inputs, while
performance sharply declines for longer, multi-page contexts. Our experiments
further reveal that text resolution has negligible effects on multimodal
performance. These findings highlight needed improvements in VLMs, particularly
their reasoning over visually presented extensive textual content, a capability
critical for practical applications. ReadBench is available at

TL;DR: ASPO通过句子级偏好优化提升多模态模型性能，解决了传统DPO缺乏细粒度监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO依赖二元偏好优化，忽略细粒度句子正确性，导致次优解。

Method: 提出ASPO，动态计算句子级自适应奖励，无需额外模型或参数。

Result: 实验表明ASPO显著提升多模态模型性能。

Conclusion: ASPO为多模态模型对齐提供了更精确的优化方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained significant attention for its
simplicity and computational efficiency in aligning large language models
(LLMs). Recent advancements have extended DPO to multimodal scenarios,
achieving strong performance. However, traditional DPO relies on binary
preference optimization, rewarding or penalizing entire responses without
considering fine-grained segment correctness, leading to suboptimal solutions.
The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during
the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level
Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more
precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at
the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content
assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves
the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO
substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models.

Result: WHISTRESS在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: WHISTRESS是一种高效且通用的句子重音检测方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Spoken language conveys meaning not only through words but also through
intonation, emotion, and emphasis. Sentence stress, the emphasis placed on
specific words within a sentence, is crucial for conveying speaker intent and
has been extensively studied in linguistics. In this work, we introduce
WHISTRESS, an alignment-free approach for enhancing transcription systems with
sentence stress detection. To support this task, we propose TINYSTRESS-15K, a
scalable, synthetic training data for the task of sentence stress detection
which resulted from a fully automated dataset creation process. We train
WHISTRESS on TINYSTRESS-15K and evaluate it against several competitive
baselines. Our results show that WHISTRESS outperforms existing methods while
requiring no additional input priors during training or inference. Notably,
despite being trained on synthetic data, WHISTRESS demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization across diverse benchmarks. Project page:

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注单一场景（跨语言或跨模态）的幻觉问题，缺乏对联合场景的探索，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了CCHall基准，同时包含跨语言和跨模态幻觉场景，并对主流开源和闭源LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前LLMs在CCHall上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CCHall可作为评估LLMs在联合跨语言和跨模态场景中的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Investigating hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs) within
cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios can greatly advance the large-scale
deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the current studies are
limited to a single scenario, either cross-lingual or cross-modal, leaving a
gap in the exploration of hallucinations in the joint cross-lingual and
cross-modal scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint
Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this
gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and
cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the
cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and
closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still
struggle with CCHall. We hope CCHall can serve as a valuable resource to assess
LLMs in joint cross-lingual and cross-modal scenarios.

Result: 在三个多跳推理数据集上实验，性能超越之前最佳方法8.6%。

Conclusion: SiGIR通过自我反馈优化推理，实验证明其有效性，并提供了未来研究的启示。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, they still face challenges in knowledge-intensive multi-hop
reasoning. Recent work explores iterative retrieval to address complex
problems. However, the lack of intermediate guidance often results in
inaccurate retrieval and flawed intermediate reasoning, leading to incorrect
reasoning. To address these, we propose Self-Critique Guided Iterative
Reasoning (SiGIR), which uses self-critique feedback to guide the iterative
reasoning process. Specifically, through end-to-end training, we enable the
model to iteratively address complex problems via question decomposition.
Additionally, the model is able to self-evaluate its intermediate reasoning
steps. During iterative reasoning, the model engages in branching exploration
and employs self-evaluation to guide the selection of promising reasoning
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop reasoning datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the previous
SOTA by $8.6\%$. Furthermore, our thorough analysis offers insights for future
research. Our code, data, and models are available at Github:

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型中的语言混淆问题，提出通过引入惩罚项（如ORPO）来抑制语言混淆，同时不降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言混淆现象严重影响低资源环境下的用户体验，传统监督微调方法未能有效解决此问题。

Method: 通过观察预训练阶段的损失轨迹，发现模型难以区分单语和语言混淆文本；提出使用ORPO方法，在标准监督微调基础上增加对不期望输出风格的惩罚。

Result: ORPO能有效抑制语言混淆生成，即使在高解码温度下也不影响模型整体性能。

Conclusion: 在低资源环境下，引入适当的惩罚项可有效缓解语言混淆问题。

Abstract: Large language models often suffer from language confusion, a phenomenon
where responses are partially or entirely generated in unintended languages.
This can critically impact user experience in low-resource settings. We
hypothesize that conventional supervised fine-tuning exacerbates this issue
because the softmax objective focuses probability mass only on the single
correct token but does not explicitly penalize cross-lingual mixing.
Interestingly, by observing loss trajectories during the pretraining phase, we
observe that models fail to learn to distinguish between monolingual and
language-confused text. Additionally, we find that ORPO, which adds penalties
for unwanted output styles to standard SFT, effectively suppresses
language-confused generations even at high decoding temperatures without
degrading overall model performance. Our findings suggest that incorporating
appropriate penalty terms can mitigate language confusion in low-resource
settings with limited data.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型取得了进展，但研究表明其存在社会偏见。本文旨在验证和比较LLMs在敏感话题上的伦理偏见，假设这些偏见可能源于语言差异。

Method: 引入MSQAD数据集，收集人权观察组织的新闻文章，生成多语言的敏感问题及回答，并通过两种统计假设测试分析偏见。

Result: 结果显示大多数情况下零假设被拒绝，表明跨语言差异导致偏见，且不同LLMs普遍存在伦理偏见。

Conclusion: 通过公开MSQAD数据集，促进未来研究跨语言偏见及其变体模型。

Abstract: Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored
the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve
into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning
globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these
biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the
Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news
articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially
sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages.
We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics,
employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null
hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from
cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses
are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were
prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly
available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining
cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

Abstract: The advent of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, has
significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks. However, their capabilities in
multilingual complex reasoning remain underexplored, with existing efforts
largely focused on simpler tasks like MGSM. To address this gap, we introduce
MMATH, a benchmark for multilingual complex reasoning spanning 374 high-quality
math problems across 10 typologically diverse languages. Using MMATH, we
observe that even advanced models like DeepSeek R1 exhibit substantial
performance disparities across languages and suffer from a critical off-target
issue-generating responses in unintended languages. To address this, we explore
strategies including prompting and training, demonstrating that reasoning in
English and answering in target languages can simultaneously enhance
performance and preserve target-language consistency. Our findings offer new

Result: 在PAN-X数据集上平均F1值提升12.1%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: RetrieveAll通过动态适应性和知识增强，有效解决了多语言NER中的语言干扰问题，提升了低资源语言的性能。

Abstract: The rise of large language models has led to significant performance
breakthroughs in named entity recognition (NER) for high-resource languages,
yet there remains substantial room for improvement in low- and medium-resource
languages. Existing multilingual NER methods face severe language interference
during the multi-language adaptation process, manifested in feature conflicts
between different languages and the competitive suppression of low-resource
language features by high-resource languages. Although training a dedicated
model for each language can mitigate such interference, it lacks scalability
and incurs excessive computational costs in real-world applications. To address
this issue, we propose RetrieveAll, a universal multilingual NER framework
based on dynamic LoRA. The framework decouples task-specific features across
languages and demonstrates efficient dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, we
introduce a cross-granularity knowledge augmented method that fully exploits
the intrinsic potential of the data without relying on external resources. By
leveraging a hierarchical prompting mechanism to guide knowledge injection,
this approach advances the paradigm from "prompt-guided inference" to
"prompt-driven learning." Experimental results show that RetrieveAll
outperforms existing baselines; on the PAN-X dataset, it achieves an average F1
improvement of 12.1 percent.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs
(MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing
parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance
gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant
computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of
self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text
contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper,
\textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from
model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token
compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the
number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive
analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across
various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing
model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a
crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we
systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing
its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across
diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current
challenges in token compression research and outline promising future
directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI
efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments
to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI
community's advancement.

Conclusion: SpokenNativQA填补了口语问答数据集的空白，推动了LLM在真实对话场景中的应用研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various disciplines and tasks. However, benchmarking their capabilities with
multilingual spoken queries remains largely unexplored. In this study, we
introduce SpokenNativQA, the first multilingual and culturally aligned spoken
question-answering (SQA) dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world
conversational settings. The dataset comprises approximately 33,000 naturally
spoken questions and answers in multiple languages, including low-resource and
dialect-rich languages, providing a robust benchmark for assessing LLM
performance in speech-based interactions. SpokenNativQA addresses the
limitations of text-based QA datasets by incorporating speech variability,
accents, and linguistic diversity. We benchmark different ASR systems and LLMs
for SQA and present our findings. We released the data at
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/QCRI/SpokenNativQA) and the experimental
scripts at (https://llmebench.qcri.org/) for the research community.

TL;DR: LLM-as-a-Judge使用大语言模型（如GPT-4）评估LLM生成内容的质量，但存在教师偏好偏差问题。AGDe-Judge框架通过引入无偏的辅助模型和三阶段去偏方法，有效减少偏差并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-Judge在评估LLM生成内容时存在教师偏好偏差，影响评估的公正性。

Method: 提出AGDe-Judge框架，引入无偏辅助模型，通过三阶段方法从标签和反馈数据中去偏。

Result: 实验表明，AGDe-Judge在六个评估基准上有效减少偏差且性能稳定。

Conclusion: AGDe-Judge解决了教师偏好偏差问题，为LLM评估提供了更公正的方法。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to
evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its
cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However,
training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher
models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher
preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for
responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased
toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building
on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to
debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference
bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

*Minh Nhat Nguyen,Pradyumna Shyama Prasad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在动态对抗辩论中的置信度调整能力，发现模型普遍存在过度自信、置信度上升、相互高估等问题，表明LLMs在多轮动态任务中缺乏准确的自我评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在动态对抗环境中是否能准确调整置信度，以评估其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 组织了60场三轮政策辩论，十种先进LLMs参与，模型在每轮后私下评估获胜置信度（0-100）。

Result: 发现五种问题模式：系统性过度自信、置信度上升、相互高估、自我辩论偏见和私人推理不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮动态任务中缺乏准确自我评估能力，这对LLM在辅助或代理角色中的应用提出了重大担忧。

Abstract: Can LLMs accurately adjust their confidence when facing opposition? Building
on previous studies measuring calibration on static fact-based
question-answering tasks, we evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in a
dynamic, adversarial debate setting, uniquely combining two realistic factors:
(a) a multi-turn format requiring models to update beliefs as new information
emerges, and (b) a zero-sum structure to control for task-related uncertainty,
since mutual high-confidence claims imply systematic overconfidence. We
organized 60 three-round policy debates among ten state-of-the-art LLMs, with
models privately rating their confidence (0-100) in winning after each round.
We observed five concerning patterns: (1) Systematic overconfidence: models
began debates with average initial confidence of 72.9% vs. a rational 50%
baseline. (2) Confidence escalation: rather than reducing confidence as debates
progressed, debaters increased their win probabilities, averaging 83% by the
final round. (3) Mutual overestimation: in 61.7% of debates, both sides
simultaneously claimed >=75% probability of victory, a logical impossibility.
(4) Persistent self-debate bias: models debating identical copies increased
confidence from 64.1% to 75.2%; even when explicitly informed their chance of
winning was exactly 50%, confidence still rose (from 50.0% to 57.1%). (5)
Misaligned private reasoning: models' private scratchpad thoughts sometimes
differed from their public confidence ratings, raising concerns about
faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning. These results suggest LLMs lack the
ability to accurately self-assess or update their beliefs in dynamic,
multi-turn tasks; a major concern as LLM outputs are deployed without careful
review in assistant roles or agentic settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出PIR框架，通过量化推理步骤的重要性，选择性剪枝低重要性功能步骤，优化训练数据，提升模型推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型的推理链中存在冗余功能步骤，增加计算负担，需优化以提升效率。

Method: 引入PIR框架，基于困惑度评估推理步骤重要性，选择性剪枝低重要性功能步骤，保留核心推理路径。

Result: PIR优化后的模型在多个基准测试中准确率提升（+0.9%至+6.6%），同时减少token使用（-3%至-41%）。

Conclusion: PIR框架能有效提升推理效率，适用于计算资源受限的场景，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities through test-time scaling approaches, particularly when fine-tuned
with chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from more powerful large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, these reasoning chains often contain verbose elements
that mirror human problem-solving, categorized as progressive reasoning (the
essential solution development path) and functional elements (verification
processes, alternative solution approaches, and error corrections). While
progressive reasoning is crucial, the functional elements significantly
increase computational demands during test-time inference. We introduce PIR
(Perplexity-based Importance Refinement), a principled framework that
quantitatively evaluates the importance of each reasoning step based on its
impact on answer prediction confidence. PIR systematically identifies and
selectively prunes only low-importance functional steps while preserving
progressive reasoning components, creating optimized training data that
maintains the integrity of the core solution path while reducing verbosity.
Models fine-tuned on PIR-optimized data exhibit superior test-time scaling
properties, generating more concise reasoning chains while achieving improved
accuracy (+0.9\% to +6.6\%) with significantly reduced token usage (-3\% to
-41\%) across challenging reasoning benchmarks (AIME, AMC, and GPQA Diamond).
Our approach demonstrates strong generalizability across different model sizes,
data sources, and token budgets, offering a practical solution for deploying
reasoning-capable LLMs in scenarios where efficient test-time scaling, response
time, and computational efficiency are valuable constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治声明的不一致性会削弱公众信任并增加问责难度，自动检测不一致性有助于记者提问，从而增强政治问责。

Method: 提出不一致性检测任务，开发不一致性类型量表，构建包含698对人工标注政治声明的数据集，并评估LLM的表现。

Result: LLM在检测不一致性方面与人类表现相当，甚至优于个别人类，但在细粒度类型识别上未达上限。

Conclusion: 论文为政治领域的不一致性检测提供了资源，展示了LLM的潜力，同时指出细粒度识别仍需改进。

Abstract: Inconsistent political statements represent a form of misinformation. They
erode public trust and pose challenges to accountability, when left unnoticed.
Detecting inconsistencies automatically could support journalists in asking
clarification questions, thereby helping to keep politicians accountable. We
propose the Inconsistency detection task and develop a scale of inconsistency
types to prompt NLP-research in this direction. To provide a resource for
detecting inconsistencies in a political domain, we present a dataset of 698
human-annotated pairs of political statements with explanations of the
annotators' reasoning for 237 samples. The statements mainly come from voting
assistant platforms such as Wahl-O-Mat in Germany and Smartvote in Switzerland,
reflecting real-world political issues. We benchmark Large Language Models
(LLMs) on our dataset and show that in general, they are as good as humans at
detecting inconsistencies, and might be even better than individual humans at
predicting the crowd-annotated ground-truth. However, when it comes to
identifying fine-grained inconsistency types, none of the model have reached
the upper bound of performance (due to natural labeling variation), thus
leaving room for improvement. We make our dataset and code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码（SD）在大型语言模型（LLMs）中已证明能加速自回归生成，但在视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: DREAM结合跨注意力机制、基于注意力熵的自适应特征选择和视觉标记压缩，优化推测解码过程。

Conclusion: DREAM为多模态解码提供高效、准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a powerful method for accelerating
autoregressive generation in large language models (LLMs), yet its integration
into vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. We introduce DREAM, a
novel speculative decoding framework tailored for VLMs that combines three key
innovations: (1) a cross-attention-based mechanism to inject intermediate
features from the target model into the draft model for improved alignment, (2)
adaptive intermediate feature selection based on attention entropy to guide
efficient draft model training, and (3) visual token compression to reduce
draft model latency. DREAM enables efficient, accurate, and parallel multimodal
decoding with significant throughput improvement. Experiments across a diverse
set of recent popular VLMs, including LLaVA, Pixtral, SmolVLM and Gemma3,
demonstrate up to 3.6x speedup over conventional decoding and significantly
outperform prior SD baselines in both inference throughput and speculative
draft acceptance length across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. The code
is publicly available at: https://github.com/SAI-Lab-NYU/DREAM.git

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS系统在流式LLM中引入不可接受的延迟，影响对话AI的响应速度。

Method: 采用仅解码器架构，通过下一步预测损失训练，增量生成音频。

Result: SpeakStream在首令牌延迟上达到最优，同时保持非流式TTS的质量。

Conclusion: SpeakStream为流式对话AI提供了低延迟、高质量的TTS解决方案。

Abstract: The latency bottleneck of traditional text-to-speech (TTS) systems
fundamentally hinders the potential of streaming large language models (LLMs)
in conversational AI. These TTS systems, typically trained and inferenced on
complete utterances, introduce unacceptable delays, even with optimized
inference speeds, when coupled with streaming LLM outputs. This is particularly
problematic for creating responsive conversational agents where low first-token
latency is critical. In this paper, we present SpeakStream, a streaming TTS
system that generates audio incrementally from streaming text using a
decoder-only architecture. SpeakStream is trained using a next-step prediction
loss on interleaved text-speech data. During inference, it generates speech
incrementally while absorbing streaming input text, making it particularly
suitable for cascaded conversational AI agents where an LLM streams text to a
TTS system. Our experiments demonstrate that SpeakStream achieves
state-of-the-art latency results in terms of first-token latency while
maintaining the quality of non-streaming TTS systems.

Conclusion: 分层搜索方法能有效优化假设生成，提升细粒度假设的质量和可操作性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific
hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained
hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We
introduce and formally define the novel task of fine-grained scientific
hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally
actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as
a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'
capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four
foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to
formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most
promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own
internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis
space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment
with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an
ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than
defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)
whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape
than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search
method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,
progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We
show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables
more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of
expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show
that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在复杂代理角色中的应用，道德对齐成为AI安全的关键问题，但目前对模型在道德与利益冲突情境中的行为理解有限。

Method: 引入MoralSim框架，在囚徒困境和公共物品游戏中测试多种前沿LLMs，结合三种道德框架，系统分析其行为。

Result: 不同模型在道德行为倾向和一致性上存在显著差异，且没有模型在所有情境中表现出一致的道德行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调在部署LLMs于代理角色时需谨慎，因其自我利益可能与道德期望冲突。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use in
complex agentic roles, involving decision-making with humans or other agents,
making ethical alignment a key AI safety concern. While prior work has examined
both LLMs' moral judgment and strategic behavior in social dilemmas, there is
limited understanding of how they act when moral imperatives directly conflict
with rewards or incentives. To investigate this, we introduce Moral Behavior in
Social Dilemma Simulation (MoralSim) and evaluate how LLMs behave in the
prisoner's dilemma and public goods game with morally charged contexts. In
MoralSim, we test a range of frontier models across both game structures and
three distinct moral framings, enabling a systematic examination of how LLMs
navigate social dilemmas in which ethical norms conflict with payoff-maximizing
strategies. Our results show substantial variation across models in both their
general tendency to act morally and the consistency of their behavior across
game types, the specific moral framing, and situational factors such as
opponent behavior and survival risks. Crucially, no model exhibits consistently
moral behavior in MoralSim, highlighting the need for caution when deploying
LLMs in agentic roles where the agent's "self-interest" may conflict with
ethical expectations. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DIET为开发高效、实用且高性能的语言模型提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning but often
over-think, generating excessively long responses that hinder efficiency. We
introduce DIET ( DIfficulty-AwarE Training), a framework that systematically
cuts these "token calories" by integrating on-the-fly problem difficulty into
the reinforcement learning (RL) process. DIET dynamically adapts token
compression strategies by modulating token penalty strength and conditioning
target lengths on estimated task difficulty, to optimize the
performance-efficiency trade-off. We also theoretically analyze the pitfalls of
naive reward weighting in group-normalized RL algorithms like GRPO, and propose
Advantage Weighting technique, which enables stable and effective
implementation of these difficulty-aware objectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that DIET significantly reduces token counts while simultaneously
improving reasoning performance. Beyond raw token reduction, we show two
crucial benefits largely overlooked by prior work: (1) DIET leads to superior
inference scaling. By maintaining high per-sample quality with fewer tokens, it
enables better scaling performance via majority voting with more samples under
fixed computational budgets, an area where other methods falter. (2) DIET
enhances the natural positive correlation between response length and problem
difficulty, ensuring verbosity is appropriately allocated, unlike many existing
compression methods that disrupt this relationship. Our analyses provide a
principled and effective framework for developing more efficient, practical,
and high-performing LLMs.

Conclusion: CrEval能有效提升LLM创造力，未来将公开数据、代码和模型以支持研究。

Abstract: Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language
models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human
judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated
methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or
prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with
human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging
shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce
CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic
creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through
training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval
demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with
human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance
of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly
robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the
creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to
support further research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing
concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations,
and limited multilingual capability. In this survey, we conduct a data-driven,
semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLM (LLLMs) from 2022 to
2024 using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers,
we identify 14,648 relevant papers using keyword filtering, LLM-based
classification, validated against expert labels, and topic clustering (via two
approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM). We find that LLM-related research
increases over fivefold in ACL and fourfold in arXiv. Since 2022, LLLMs
research grows even faster, reaching over 30% of LLM papers by late 2024.
Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization,
hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL
dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and
controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations,
knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2024. We release a
dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, and offer a
quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research.

Conclusion: 强调了过程级、难度感知的推理策略适应的重要性，为LLMs高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current large-language models (LLMs) typically adopt a fixed reasoning
strategy, either simple or complex, for all questions, regardless of their
difficulty. This neglect of variation in task and reasoning process complexity
leads to an imbalance between performance and efficiency. Existing methods
attempt to implement training-free fast-slow thinking system switching to
handle problems of varying difficulty, but are limited by coarse-grained
solution-level strategy adjustments. To address this issue, we propose a novel
reasoning paradigm: Process-Level Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching (PATS),
which enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning strategy based on the
difficulty of each step, optimizing the balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our approach integrates Process Reward Models (PRMs)
with Beam Search, incorporating progressive mode switching and bad-step penalty
mechanisms. Experiments on diverse mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our
methodology achieves high accuracy while maintaining moderate token usage. This
study emphasizes the significance of process-level, difficulty-aware reasoning
strategy adaptation, offering valuable insights into efficient inference for
LLMs.

Method: 创建了一个包含1,957条波兰语评论的数据集（其中540条标注双质量问题），测试了SetFit、transformer编码器和LLMs等方法，并进行了多语言迁移评估。

Result: 实验验证了多种方法的有效性，并展示了多语言迁移的潜力。

Conclusion: 研究为双质量问题的自动化检测提供了实用解决方案，并探讨了部署和应用前景。

Abstract: Consumers often face inconsistent product quality, particularly when
identical products vary between markets, a situation known as the dual quality
problem. To identify and address this issue, automated techniques are needed.
This paper explores how natural language processing (NLP) can aid in detecting
such discrepancies and presents the full process of developing a solution.
First, we describe in detail the creation of a new Polish-language dataset with
1,957 reviews, 540 highlighting dual quality issues. We then discuss
experiments with various approaches like SetFit with sentence-transformers,
transformer-based encoders, and LLMs, including error analysis and robustness
verification. Additionally, we evaluate multilingual transfer using a subset of
opinions in English, French, and German. The paper concludes with insights on
deployment and practical applications.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中知识的结构模式，从图的角度量化知识，并开发图机器学习模型估计实体知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注LLM知识的结构模式，填补这一空白。

Method: 从三元组和实体层面量化知识，分析其与图结构属性（如节点度）的关系，并开发基于局部邻居的图模型估计实体知识。

Result: 发现知识同质性，且通过选择LLM较少了解的三元组进行微调，性能更优。

Conclusion: 图视角为LLM知识分析提供了新思路，且基于结构模式的微调策略有效。

Abstract: Large language models have been extensively studied as neural knowledge bases
for their knowledge access, editability, reasoning, and explainability.
However, few works focus on the structural patterns of their knowledge.
Motivated by this gap, we investigate these structural patterns from a graph
perspective. We quantify the knowledge of LLMs at both the triplet and entity
levels, and analyze how it relates to graph structural properties such as node
degree. Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically
close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further
motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity
knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable
knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results
show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，以解决现有长上下文评估基准的不足，有效分离模型的基础能力和长上下文能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文评估基准存在两个主要问题：一是缺乏区分长上下文性能和模型基础能力的指标，二是固定输入长度限制了适用性。

Method: 引入长度可控的长上下文基准测试和新指标，分离基础知识和真实长上下文能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效评估LLMs的长上下文能力。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有基准的不足，为长上下文能力评估提供了更清晰的工具。

Abstract: Long-context capability is considered one of the most important abilities of
LLMs, as a truly long context-capable LLM enables users to effortlessly process
many originally exhausting tasks -- e.g., digesting a long-form document to
find answers vs. directly asking an LLM about it. However, existing
real-task-based long-context evaluation benchmarks have two major shortcomings.
First, benchmarks like LongBench often do not provide proper metrics to
separate long-context performance from the model's baseline ability, making
cross-model comparison unclear. Second, such benchmarks are usually constructed
with fixed input lengths, which limits their applicability across different
models and fails to reveal when a model begins to break down. To address these
issues, we introduce a length-controllable long-context benchmark and a novel
metric that disentangles baseline knowledge from true long-context
capabilities. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
effectively evaluating LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量预测与解释一致性的方法（PEX），并发现大语言模型生成的解释中超过62%缺乏一致性。通过直接偏好优化，一致性提升了43.1%至292.3%，且解释忠实度提高了9.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险AI决策中，生成和评估自由文本解释的忠实性具有挑战性，需要量化解释与预测的一致性。

Method: 扩展了证据权重的概念，提出PEX一致性度量，并通过直接偏好优化改进生成解释的一致性。

Result: 超过62%的大语言模型生成解释缺乏一致性；直接偏好优化使一致性提升43.1%至292.3%，忠实度提高9.7%。

Conclusion: PEX一致性是解释忠实性的重要指标，直接偏好优化可显著提升生成解释的质量。

Abstract: Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in
high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate
by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure
for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of
weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation
supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation
faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by
large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct
preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations
across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can
improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.

TL;DR: SituatedThinker框架通过结合内部知识和外部信息，增强大型语言模型的实时推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力受限于内部参数空间，无法实时获取外部信息。

Method: 引入SituatedThinker框架，利用强化学习结合内部知识和外部接口，实现实时推理。

Result: 在多跳问答和数学推理任务中表现显著提升，并在KBQA、TableQA等未见任务中展示泛化能力。

Conclusion: SituatedThinker通过实时信息融合，突破了LLMs的知识边界，提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their impressive
reasoning capabilities. However, the reasoning confined to internal parametric
space limits LLMs' access to real-time information and understanding of the
physical world. To overcome this constraint, we introduce SituatedThinker, a
novel framework that enables LLMs to ground their reasoning in real-world
contexts through situated thinking, which adaptively combines both internal
knowledge and external information with predefined interfaces. By utilizing
reinforcement learning, SituatedThinker incentivizes deliberate reasoning with
the real world to acquire information and feedback, allowing LLMs to surpass
their knowledge boundaries and enhance reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements on multi-hop
question-answering and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore,
SituatedThinker demonstrates strong performance on unseen tasks, such as KBQA,
TableQA, and text-based games, showcasing the generalizable real-world grounded
reasoning capability. Our codes are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PatentScore是一个针对LLM生成的专利权利要求的多维评估框架，结合法律和技术标准，优于通用NLG指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLG指标不适用于专利文件的结构和法律特性，且LLM生成专利的研究有限，尤其是权利要求评估。

Method: 引入PatentScore框架，包括层次分解、领域特定验证模式和多维评分（结构、语义、法律）。

Result: 在400个GPT-4o-mini生成的权利要求中，Pearson相关性r=0.819，优于现有指标，且在Claude-3.5-Haiku和Gemini-1.5-flash中表现稳健。

Conclusion: PatentScore能有效评估专利权利要求，具有鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) metrics play a central role in evaluating
generated texts, but are not well suited for the structural and legal
characteristics of patent documents. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong
potential in automating patent generation, yet research on evaluating
LLM-generated patents remains limited, especially in evaluating the generation
quality of patent claims, which are central to defining the scope of
protection. Effective claim evaluation requires addressing legal validity,
technical accuracy, and structural compliance. To address this gap, we
introduce PatentScore, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing
LLM-generated patent claims. PatentScore incorporates: (1) hierarchical
decomposition for claim analysis; (2) domain-specific validation patterns based
on legal and technical standards; and (3) scoring across structural, semantic,
and legal dimensions. Unlike general-purpose NLG metrics, PatentScore reflects
patent-specific constraints and document structures, enabling evaluation beyond
surface similarity. We evaluate 400 GPT-4o-mini generated Claim 1s and report a
Pearson correlation of $r = 0.819$ with expert annotations, outperforming
existing NLG metrics. Furthermore, we conduct additional evaluations using open
models such as Claude-3.5-Haiku and Gemini-1.5-flash, all of which show strong
correlations with expert judgments, confirming the robustness and
generalizability of our framework.

TL;DR: GC-KBVQA是一种新的四阶段框架，通过生成问题感知的标题和外部知识结合，提升LLM在零样本VQA任务中的表现，无需多模态训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KB-VQA方法依赖的知识可能无关或误导，限制了其潜力。

Method: 提出GC-KBVQA框架，结合问题感知标题生成和外部知识，生成高效提示。

Result: 相比现有KB-VQA方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GC-KBVQA无需任务微调，降低成本与复杂度，适用于多种VQA任务。

Abstract: Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) methods focus on tasks
that demand reasoning with information extending beyond the explicit content
depicted in the image. Early methods relied on explicit knowledge bases to
provide this auxiliary information. Recent approaches leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge sources. While KB-VQA methods have
demonstrated promising results, their potential remains constrained as the
auxiliary text provided may not be relevant to the question context, and may
also include irrelevant information that could misguide the answer predictor.
We introduce a novel four-stage framework called Grounding Caption-Guided
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (GC-KBVQA), which enables LLMs to
effectively perform zero-shot VQA tasks without the need for end-to-end
multimodal training. Innovations include grounding question-aware caption
generation to move beyond generic descriptions and have compact, yet detailed
and context-rich information. This is combined with knowledge from external
sources to create highly informative prompts for the LLM. GC-KBVQA can address
a variety of VQA tasks, and does not require task-specific fine-tuning, thus
reducing both costs and deployment complexity by leveraging general-purpose,
pre-trained LLMs. Comparison with competing KB-VQA methods shows significantly
improved performance. Our code will be made public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉外部时间信号对参与度的因果机制，需区分相关性与因果关系以理解社交媒体的真实影响。

Method: 引入结合政策时间和参与效果的联合框架，借鉴医疗领域的因果推断技术，估计社交媒体交互中的平均处理效应（ATE）。

Result: 在真实世界数据实验中，模型在预测参与度上优于基准15-22%，且因果效应测量与专家评估一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了外部混杂信号的挑战，为社交媒体影响力分析提供了更准确的因果推断工具。

Abstract: Understanding true influence in social media requires distinguishing
correlation from causation--particularly when analyzing misinformation spread.
While existing approaches focus on exposure metrics and network structures,
they often fail to capture the causal mechanisms by which external temporal
signals trigger engagement. We introduce a novel joint treatment-outcome
framework that leverages existing sequential models to simultaneously adapt to
both policy timing and engagement effects. Our approach adapts causal inference
techniques from healthcare to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATE) within
the sequential nature of social media interactions, tackling challenges from
external confounding signals. Through our experiments on real-world
misinformation and disinformation datasets, we show that our models outperform
existing benchmarks by 15--22% in predicting engagement across diverse
counterfactual scenarios, including exposure adjustment, timing shifts, and
varied intervention durations. Case studies on 492 social media users show our
causal effect measure aligns strongly with the gold standard in influence
estimation, the expert-based empirical influence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图表理解任务中存在幻觉问题，生成的文本可能与视觉数据冲突，需要一种方法来验证图表相关响应的准确性。

Method: 提出ChartLens算法，结合基于分割的技术识别图表对象，并使用标记集提示多模态大语言模型进行细粒度视觉归因。

Conclusion: ChartLens和ChartVA-Eval为解决图表理解中的幻觉问题提供了有效工具，显著提升了模型的可信度。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
advanced tasks like chart understanding. However, these models often suffer
from hallucinations, where generated text sequences conflict with the provided
visual data. To address this, we introduce Post-Hoc Visual Attribution for
Charts, which identifies fine-grained chart elements that validate a given
chart-associated response. We propose ChartLens, a novel chart attribution
algorithm that uses segmentation-based techniques to identify chart objects and
employs set-of-marks prompting with MLLMs for fine-grained visual attribution.
Additionally, we present ChartVA-Eval, a benchmark with synthetic and
real-world charts from diverse domains like finance, policy, and economics,
featuring fine-grained attribution annotations. Our evaluations show that
ChartLens improves fine-grained attributions by 26-66%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人们在解释他人行为时，倾向于归因哪些信念，尤其是这些信念作为解释的强度如何。

Method: 开发了一个计算模型，通过准确性、信息量和因果相关性三个因素量化信念的解释强度，并通过实验验证模型。

Result: 准确性和信息量结合时能较好预测信念归因，但因果相关性是单一最能解释参与者选择的因素。

Conclusion: 因果相关性在人们选择性归因信念时起关键作用，为理解人类心智理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: A key feature of human theory-of-mind is the ability to attribute beliefs to
other agents as mentalistic explanations for their behavior. But given the wide
variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language
we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to
attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people
prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they
observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory
strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three
factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of
which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven
behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people
selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an
experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in
order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's
beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity
perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that
causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants'
responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本语音合成中风格表示的鲁棒性和丰富性问题。

Method: 使用渐进式风格编码器，先捕捉局部风格，再通过自注意力结合为全局风格条件。

Result: 在未见过的说话者上测试，表现出良好的自然度、说话者相似性和清晰度。

Conclusion: GSA-TTS在风格表示、可解释性和可控性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We present the gradual style adaptor TTS (GSA-TTS) with a novel style encoder
that gradually encodes speaking styles from an acoustic reference for zero-shot
speech synthesis. GSA first captures the local style of each semantic sound
unit. Then the local styles are combined by self-attention to obtain a global
style condition. This semantic and hierarchical encoding strategy provides a
robust and rich style representation for an acoustic model. We test GSA-TTS on
unseen speakers and obtain promising results regarding naturalness, speaker
similarity, and intelligibility. Additionally, we explore the potential of GSA
in terms of interpretability and controllability, which stems from its
hierarchical structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码文档编写耗时，现有摘要生成技术难以比较，人工评估昂贵且自动指标不可靠。

Method: 使用LLM为摘要评分，考虑代码内容，无需参考摘要。

Result: 新方法优于现有指标，建议与嵌入方法结合以避免LLM偏见。

Conclusion: LLM评分方法有效，但需结合其他方法以减少偏见。

Abstract: Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different
techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is
difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are
unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask
an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based
baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This
allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary
at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of
documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than
prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based
methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.

Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统在协作推理中可能泄露敏感或受版权保护的内容，现有技术仅关注最终输出，忽略推理过程。

Method: 引入CoTGuard框架，利用触发查询激活特定推理段，监控中间步骤以检测未经授权的内容复制。

Result: 实验表明，CoTGuard能有效发现内容泄露，且对任务性能干扰极小。

Conclusion: 推理级监控为LLM智能体系统中的知识产权保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into autonomous agents capable of
collaborative reasoning and task execution, multi-agent LLM systems have
emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems. However, these
systems pose new challenges for copyright protection, particularly when
sensitive or copyrighted content is inadvertently recalled through inter-agent
communication and reasoning. Existing protection techniques primarily focus on
detecting content in final outputs, overlooking the richer, more revealing
reasoning processes within the agents themselves. In this paper, we introduce
CoTGuard, a novel framework for copyright protection that leverages
trigger-based detection within Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Specifically,
we can activate specific CoT segments and monitor intermediate reasoning steps
for unauthorized content reproduction by embedding specific trigger queries
into agent prompts. This approach enables fine-grained, interpretable detection
of copyright violations in collaborative agent scenarios. We evaluate CoTGuard
on various benchmarks in extensive experiments and show that it effectively
uncovers content leakage with minimal interference to task performance. Our
findings suggest that reasoning-level monitoring offers a promising direction
for safeguarding intellectual property in LLM-based agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在知识不足时容易产生幻觉。结合知识图谱（KGs）虽能提供结构化信息，但现有方法生成的推理路径常不完整或不一致。

Method: SRP框架通过迭代式参考引导推理，结合LLMs与KGs。具体包括搜索参考、生成推理路径、检索知识并迭代反思，直至正确检索答案。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，SRP优于多种基线方法，展现了可靠的推理能力。

Conclusion: SRP通过迭代反思和参考引导，显著提升了LLMs与KGs结合的推理能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet they remain prone to
hallucinations when reasoning with insufficient internal knowledge. While
integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured,
verifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or
factually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective
Planning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative,
reference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities,
SRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the
planning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.
After retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements
iterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning
path until the answer is correctly retrieved. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrate that SRP surpasses various strong baselines and
further underscore its reliable reasoning ability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注选择与查询最相似的示例，而示例多样性的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过实验在多种任务（如情感分类、数学和代码问题）中系统研究多样性选择方法，并引入理论框架解释其优势。

Result: 实验表明，多样性选择方法显著提升性能，特别是在复杂任务中，并增强对分布外查询的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多样性在示例选择中具有重要作用，理论框架支持了这一发现。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a crucial capability of current large language
models (LLMs), where the selection of examples plays a key role in performance.
While most existing approaches focus on selecting the most similar examples to
the query, the impact of diversity in example selection remains underexplored.
We systematically investigate the role of diversity in in-context example
selection through experiments across a range of tasks, from sentiment
classification to more challenging math and code problems. Experiments on
Llama-3.1, Gemma-2, and Mistral-v0.3 families of models show that
diversity-aware selection methods improve performance, particularly on complex
tasks like math and code, and enhance robustness to out-of-distribution
queries. To support these findings, we introduce a theoretical framework that
explains the benefits of incorporating diversity in in-context example
selection.

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优于竞争对手，支持OOD泛化。

Conclusion: FAAF通过动态调整AI作为“思考伙伴”，推动了可扩展的人机协作。

Abstract: AI support of collaborative interactions entails mediating potential
misalignment between interlocutor beliefs. Common preference alignment methods
like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks
where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We
propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise,
context-aware "friction" that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of
existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a
frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention
policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical
solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple
supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms
competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD
generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive "thought partners" -- not
passive responders -- FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: 长形式口语媒体的细粒度信息访问仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Podcasts have become daily companions for half a billion users. Given the
enormous amount of podcast content available, highlights provide a valuable
signal that helps viewers get the gist of an episode and decide if they want to
invest in listening to it in its entirety. However, identifying highlights
automatically is challenging due to the unstructured and long-form nature of
the content. We introduce Rhapsody, a dataset of 13K podcast episodes paired
with segment-level highlight scores derived from YouTube's 'most replayed'
feature. We frame the podcast highlight detection as a segment-level binary
classification task. We explore various baseline approaches, including
zero-shot prompting of language models and lightweight finetuned language
models using segment-level classification heads. Our experimental results
indicate that even state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4o and Gemini
struggle with this task, while models finetuned with in-domain data
significantly outperform their zero-shot performance. The finetuned model
benefits from leveraging both speech signal features and transcripts. These
findings highlight the challenges for fine-grained information access in
long-form spoken media.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准Fin-Force，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融领域的前向反事实推理能力，旨在自动化预测市场发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场的动态性要求预测未来可能的发展，以揭示风险和机会，但手动操作认知负担重，需要自动化解决方案。LLMs在此领域的应用尚未探索。

Method: 通过构建Fin-Force基准，结合金融新闻标题和结构化评估，支持基于LLMs的前向反事实生成。

Result: 实验评估了前沿LLMs和反事实生成方法，分析了其局限性并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: Fin-Force为自动化预测金融市场发展提供了结构化工具，为决策支持开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to
actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct
form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future
developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial
markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential
risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making.
However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands
involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address
this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward
Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing
structured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual
generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for
exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing
structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we
evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing
their limitations and proposing insights for future research.

*Zhihong Pan,Kai Zhang,Yuze Zhao,Yupeng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Route-To-Reason（RTR）框架，动态分配语言模型和推理策略以优化任务性能，在计算效率和准确性间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理任务中计算成本高且易陷入“过度思考”，需要一种低成本、灵活的解决方案。

Method: RTR框架学习专家模型和推理策略的压缩表示，动态分配资源，支持任意黑盒或白盒模型。

Result: 在七个开源模型和四种推理策略上，RTR比最佳单一模型更准确，同时减少60%以上的计算开销。

Conclusion: RTR是一种低成本、灵活的通用框架，显著提升了推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The inherent capabilities of a language model (LM) and the reasoning
strategies it employs jointly determine its performance in reasoning tasks.
While test-time scaling is regarded as an effective approach to tackling
complex reasoning tasks, it incurs substantial computational costs and often
leads to "overthinking", where models become trapped in "thought pitfalls". To
address this challenge, we propose Route-To-Reason (RTR), a novel unified
routing framework that dynamically allocates both LMs and reasoning strategies
according to task difficulty under budget constraints. RTR learns compressed
representations of both expert models and reasoning strategies, enabling their
joint and adaptive selection at inference time. This method is low-cost, highly
flexible, and can be seamlessly extended to arbitrary black-box or white-box
models and strategies, achieving true plug-and-play functionality. Extensive
experiments across seven open source models and four reasoning strategies
demonstrate that RTR achieves an optimal trade-off between accuracy and
computational efficiency among all baselines, achieving higher accuracy than
the best single model while reducing token usage by over 60%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种利用格式和长度作为替代信号训练LLM解决数学问题的方法，减少对真实答案的依赖，并在某些场景下超越传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM解决数学问题时，获取真实答案成本高且困难，因此需要替代方案。

Method: 采用格式正确性和答案长度作为奖励信号，结合GRPO算法训练LLM。

Result: 在AIME2024上达到40.0%准确率，某些情况下超越依赖真实答案的传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了一种实用解决方案，还揭示了LLM通过培养答题习惯即可释放其潜在能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing tasks, with Reinforcement Learning playing a key role in adapting
them to specific applications. However, obtaining ground truth answers for
training LLMs in mathematical problem-solving is often challenging, costly, and
sometimes unfeasible. This research delves into the utilization of format and
length as surrogate signals to train LLMs for mathematical problem-solving,
bypassing the need for traditional ground truth answers.Our study shows that a
reward function centered on format correctness alone can yield performance
improvements comparable to the standard GRPO algorithm in early phases.
Recognizing the limitations of format-only rewards in the later phases, we
incorporate length-based rewards. The resulting GRPO approach, leveraging
format-length surrogate signals, not only matches but surpasses the performance
of the standard GRPO algorithm relying on ground truth answers in certain
scenarios, achieving 40.0\% accuracy on AIME2024 with a 7B base model. Through
systematic exploration and experimentation, this research not only offers a
practical solution for training LLMs to solve mathematical problems and
reducing the dependence on extensive ground truth data collection, but also
reveals the essence of why our label-free approach succeeds: base model is like
an excellent student who has already mastered mathematical and logical
reasoning skills, but performs poorly on the test paper, it simply needs to
develop good answering habits to achieve outstanding results in exams , in
other words, to unlock the capabilities it already possesses.

Abstract: This paper studies the emergence of interpretable categorical features within
large language models (LLMs), analyzing their behavior across training
checkpoints (time), transformer layers (space), and varying model sizes
(scale). Using sparse autoencoders for mechanistic interpretability, we
identify when and where specific semantic concepts emerge within neural
activations. Results indicate clear temporal and scale-specific thresholds for
feature emergence across multiple domains. Notably, spatial analysis reveals
unexpected semantic reactivation, with early-layer features re-emerging at
later layers, challenging standard assumptions about representational dynamics
in transformer models.

TL;DR: FlowHN是一种新型并行混合网络架构，通过动态分配输入令牌和融合分支输出，显著提升处理速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决序列和并行混合架构中存在的计算负载不平衡和知识表示表达性问题。

Method: 提出FlowHN，采用FLOP感知的动态令牌分配和分支输出融合方法。

Result: 在135M、350M和1B参数的模型中，FlowHN比竞争方法快4倍，MFU提升2倍。

Conclusion: FlowHN通过并行混合架构和动态负载平衡，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Attention and State-Space Models (SSMs) when combined in a hybrid network in
sequence or in parallel provide complementary strengths. In a hybrid sequential
pipeline they alternate between applying a transformer to the input and then
feeding its output into a SSM. This results in idle periods in the individual
components increasing end-to-end latency and lowering throughput caps. In the
parallel hybrid architecture, the transformer operates independently in
parallel with the SSM, and these pairs are cascaded, with output from one pair
forming the input to the next. Two issues are (i) creating an expressive
knowledge representation with the inherently divergent outputs from these
separate branches, and (ii) load balancing the computation between these
parallel branches, while maintaining representation fidelity. In this work we
present FlowHN, a novel parallel hybrid network architecture that accommodates
various strategies for load balancing, achieved through appropriate
distribution of input tokens between the two branches. Two innovative
differentiating factors in FlowHN include a FLOP aware dynamic token split
between the attention and SSM branches yielding efficient balance in compute
load, and secondly, a method to fuse the highly divergent outputs from
individual branches for enhancing representation expressivity. Together they
enable much better token processing speeds, avoid bottlenecks, and at the same
time yield significantly improved accuracy as compared to other competing
works. We conduct comprehensive experiments on autoregressive language modeling
for models with 135M, 350M, and 1B parameters. FlowHN outperforms sequential
hybrid models and its parallel counterpart, achieving up to 4* higher Tokens
per Second (TPS) and 2* better Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU).

Motivation: 解决预训练语言模型在分布外数据上表现不佳的问题，尤其是面对结构新颖的推理任务时。

Method: 使用验证器对生成响应评分，选择高置信度伪标记样本进行微调，仅调整低秩LoRA适配器参数。

Result: 在三个基准测试和三种先进LLM上，VDS-TTT相对基线模型提升32.29%，比无测试时训练的验证器方法高6.66%。

Conclusion: VDS-TTT是一种高效的自监督框架，能动态提升语言模型在未知任务上的适应能力。

Abstract: Learning to adapt pretrained language models to unlabeled,
out-of-distribution data is a critical challenge, as models often falter on
structurally novel reasoning tasks even while excelling within their training
distribution. We introduce a new framework called VDS-TTT - Verifier-Driven
Sample Selection for Test-Time Training to efficiently address this. We use a
learned verifier to score a pool of generated responses and select only from
high ranking pseudo-labeled examples for fine-tuned adaptation. Specifically,
for each input query our LLM generates N candidate answers; the verifier
assigns a reliability score to each, and the response with the highest
confidence and above a fixed threshold is paired with its query for test-time
training. We fine-tune only low-rank LoRA adapter parameters, ensuring
adaptation efficiency and fast convergence. Our proposed self-supervised
framework is the first to synthesize verifier driven test-time training data
for continuous self-improvement of the model. Experiments across three diverse
benchmarks and three state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that VDS-TTT yields up
to a 32.29% relative improvement over the base model and a 6.66% gain compared
to verifier-based methods without test-time training, highlighting its
effectiveness and efficiency for on-the-fly large language model adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they often exhibit a specific cultural biases, neglecting
the values and linguistic diversity of low-resource regions. This cultural bias
not only undermines universal equality, but also risks reinforcing stereotypes
and perpetuating discrimination. To address this, we propose CulFiT, a novel
culturally-aware training paradigm that leverages multilingual data and
fine-grained reward modeling to enhance cultural sensitivity and inclusivity.
Our approach synthesizes diverse cultural-related questions, constructs
critique data in culturally relevant languages, and employs fine-grained
rewards to decompose cultural texts into verifiable knowledge units for
interpretable evaluation. We also introduce GlobalCultureQA, a multilingual
open-ended question-answering dataset designed to evaluate culturally-aware
responses in a global context. Extensive experiments on three existing
benchmarks and our GlobalCultureQA demonstrate that CulFiT achieves
state-of-the-art open-source model performance in cultural alignment and
general reasoning.

Result: LLMs在场景图理解上表现良好，但在复杂叙述的场景图生成中存在困难，尤其是分解离散场景的能力不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在场景图生成中的瓶颈，为未来改进方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied
AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these
applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal
environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene
graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and
their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs'
ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess
LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual
narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models
perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph
generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that
these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex
narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings
underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and
provide valuable insights for future research. The demonstration of our
benchmark is available at https://tsg-bench.netlify.app. Additionally, our code
and evaluation data are publicly available at

Result: 框架和CEC指标为小型模型的因果推理训练和解释评估提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升小型模型的因果推理能力及评估解释质量提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large proprietary language models exhibit strong causal reasoning abilities
that smaller open-source models struggle to replicate. We introduce a novel
framework for distilling causal explanations that transfers causal reasoning
skills from a powerful teacher model to a compact open-source model. The key
idea is to train the smaller model to develop causal reasoning abilities by
generating structured cause-and-effect explanations consistent with those of
the teacher model. To evaluate the quality of the student-generated
explanations, we introduce a new metric called Causal Explanation Coherence
(CEC) to assess the structural and logical consistency of causal reasoning.
This metric uses sentence-level semantic alignment to measure how well each
part of the generated explanation corresponds to the teacher's reference,
capturing both faithfulness and coverage of the underlying causal chain. Our
framework and the CEC metric provide a principled foundation for training
smaller models to perform robust causal reasoning and for systematically
assessing the coherence of explanations in language model outputs.

Conclusion: 将数据合成整合到提示学习中能系统性提升性能。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language
models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most
existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input
distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We
introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a
closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data
generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data
generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples
that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines
the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic
improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external
supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning
benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods,
highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning
workflows.

Abstract: We present a critical discourse analysis of the 2024 U.S. presidential
debates, examining Donald Trump's rhetorical strategies in his interactions
with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We introduce a novel annotation framework,
BEADS (Bias Enriched Annotation for Dialogue Structure), which systematically
extends the DAMSL framework to capture bias driven and adversarial discourse
features in political communication. BEADS includes a domain and language
agnostic set of tags that model ideological framing, emotional appeals, and
confrontational tactics. Our methodology compares detailed human annotation
with zero shot ChatGPT assisted tagging on verified transcripts from the Trump
and Biden (19,219 words) and Trump and Harris (18,123 words) debates. Our
analysis shows that Trump consistently dominated in key categories: Challenge
and Adversarial Exchanges, Selective Emphasis, Appeal to Fear, Political Bias,
and Perceived Dismissiveness. These findings underscore his use of emotionally
charged and adversarial rhetoric to control the narrative and influence
audience perception. In this work, we establish BEADS as a scalable and
reproducible framework for critical discourse analysis across languages,
domains, and political contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论检测因依赖上下文解释而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖对比学习，但人类检测过程更注重目标与上下文的关系。

Method: AmpleHate使用预训练的命名实体识别模型识别显式目标，通过[CLS]标记捕获隐式目标信息，并基于注意力机制计算目标与上下文的关系向量。

Result: 实验表明，AmpleHate平均性能优于对比学习方法82.14%，收敛更快，且注意力模式与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: AmpleHate通过模拟人类推理过程，显著提升了隐式仇恨言论检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and
reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words.
Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be
effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however,
detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the
text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding
context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel
approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection.
AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity
Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It
computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and
sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the
final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of
target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate
that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive
learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence.
Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by
AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability
and robustness.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) have gained substantial attention due to their
ability to execute diverse language tasks successfully while using fewer

limited environments, such as mobile devices, on-device processing, and edge
systems. In this study, we present a complete assessment of SLMs, focussing on
their design frameworks, training approaches, and techniques for lowering model
size and complexity. We offer a novel classification system to organize the
optimization approaches applied for SLMs, encompassing strategies like pruning,
quantization, and model compression. Furthermore, we assemble SLM's studies of
evaluation suite with some existing datasets, establishing a rigorous platform
for measuring SLM capabilities. Alongside this, we discuss the important
difficulties that remain unresolved in this sector, including trade-offs
between efficiency and performance, and we suggest directions for future study.
We anticipate this study to serve as a beneficial guide for researchers and
practitioners who aim to construct compact, efficient, and high-performing
language models.

Motivation: 现有医疗RAG系统主要依赖医学知识库，忽略了类似病例的经验知识，而这是人类临床推理的关键部分。

Method: DoctorRAG通过为查询和知识源分配概念标签，结合混合检索机制，并集成Med-TextGrad模块，确保输出符合检索知识和患者查询。

Result: 在多语言、多任务数据集上的实验显示，DoctorRAG显著优于基线RAG模型，并通过迭代优化进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DoctorRAG生成更准确、相关且全面的响应，推动了更接近医生推理的医疗系统发展。

Abstract: Existing medical RAG systems mainly leverage knowledge from medical knowledge
bases, neglecting the crucial role of experiential knowledge derived from
similar patient cases -- a key component of human clinical reasoning. To bridge
this gap, we propose DoctorRAG, a RAG framework that emulates doctor-like
reasoning by integrating both explicit clinical knowledge and implicit
case-based experience. DoctorRAG enhances retrieval precision by first
allocating conceptual tags for queries and knowledge sources, together with a
hybrid retrieval mechanism from both relevant knowledge and patient. In
addition, a Med-TextGrad module using multi-agent textual gradients is
integrated to ensure that the final output adheres to the retrieved knowledge
and patient query. Comprehensive experiments on multilingual, multitask
datasets demonstrate that DoctorRAG significantly outperforms strong baseline
RAG models and gains improvements from iterative refinements. Our approach
generates more accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses, taking a step
towards more doctor-like medical reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs句法敏感性的形成机制，为未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been found to develop surprising internal
specializations: Individual neurons, attention heads, and circuits become
selectively sensitive to syntactic structure, reflecting patterns observed in
the human brain. While this specialization is well-documented, how it emerges
during training and what influences its development remains largely unknown.
  In this work, we tap into the black box of specialization by tracking its
formation over time. By quantifying internal syntactic consistency across
minimal pairs from various syntactic phenomena, we identify a clear
developmental trajectory: Syntactic sensitivity emerges gradually, concentrates
in specific layers, and exhibits a 'critical period' of rapid internal
specialization. This process is consistent across architectures and
initialization parameters (e.g., random seeds), and is influenced by model
scale and training data. We therefore reveal not only where syntax arises in
LLMs but also how some models internalize it during training. To support future
research, we will release the code, models, and training checkpoints upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长时对话中因上下文窗口限制导致的记忆不连贯和个性化响应不足的问题。

Method: 提出MemGAS框架，利用多粒度记忆单元和高斯混合模型聚类关联记忆，基于熵的路由器自适应选择粒度，LLM过滤优化检索结果。

Result: 在四个长时记忆基准测试中，MemGAS在问答和检索任务上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemGAS通过多粒度关联和自适应检索显著提升了LLMs的长时对话记忆性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted in
conversational agents. However, the increasingly long interactions between
users and agents accumulate extensive dialogue records, making it difficult for
LLMs with limited context windows to maintain a coherent long-term dialogue
memory and deliver personalized responses. While retrieval-augmented memory
systems have emerged to address this issue, existing methods often depend on
single-granularity memory segmentation and retrieval. This approach falls short
in capturing deep memory connections, leading to partial retrieval of useful
information or substantial noise, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
tackle these limits, we propose MemGAS, a framework that enhances memory
consolidation by constructing multi-granularity association, adaptive
selection, and retrieval. MemGAS is based on multi-granularity memory units and
employs Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster and associate new memories with
historical ones. An entropy-based router adaptively selects optimal granularity
by evaluating query relevance distributions and balancing information
completeness and noise. Retrieved memories are further refined via LLM-based
filtering. Experiments on four long-term memory benchmarks demonstrate that
MemGAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both question answer and
retrieval tasks, achieving superior performance across different query types
and top-K settings.

Motivation: 现有模型编辑数据集多关注短文本输出，忽略了文档级任务的广泛存在，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 提出文档级模型编辑任务，并设计数据集\benchmarkname，包含文档级输入输出、外推性及单次编辑中多事实的特点。

Result: 实验表明，文档级模型编辑的难度对现有方法提出了挑战。

Conclusion: 文档级模型编辑任务具有实际意义，现有方法需进一步改进以适应更高难度的编辑需求。

Abstract: Model editing aims to correct errors and outdated knowledge in the Large
language models (LLMs) with minimal cost. Prior research has proposed a variety
of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods.
However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or
sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the
real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing
this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world
scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such
challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce
\benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing,
characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple
facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and
experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model
editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合压缩方法TailorKV，结合量化和卸载技术，显著减少了生成式大语言模型中的KV缓存内存开销，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在大语言模型中带来显著内存开销，现有方法（如卸载或压缩）存在延迟高或性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出TailorKV方法，选择性加载关键令牌并量化所有令牌，结合硬件友好的实现框架。

Result: 在激进压缩设置下实现近乎无损性能，Llama-3.1-8B模型在128k上下文下可在单GPU运行，解码速度达82ms/令牌。

Conclusion: TailorKV通过互补的压缩策略，显著优化了KV缓存的内存和性能问题。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache in generative large language models (LLMs)
introduces substantial memory overhead. Existing works mitigate this burden by
offloading or compressing the KV cache. However, loading the entire cache
incurs significant latency due to PCIe bandwidth bottlenecks in CPU-GPU
communication, while aggressive compression causes notable performance
degradation. We identify that certain layers in the LLM need to maintain global
information and are unsuitable for selective loading. In contrast, other layers
primarily focus on a few tokens with dominant activations that potentially
incur substantial quantization error. This observation leads to a key insight
that loading dominant tokens and quantizing all tokens can complement each
other. Building on this insight, we propose a hybrid compression method,
TailorKV, which seamlessly integrates quantization and offloading. TailorKV
develops an inference framework along with a hardware-friendly implementation
that leverages these complementary characteristics. Extensive long-context
evaluations exhibit that TailorKV achieves nearly lossless performance under
aggressive compression settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art.
Particularly, the Llama-3.1-8B with 128k context can be served within a single
RTX 3090 GPU, reaching 82 ms per token during decoding.

Motivation: 当前LLM的多智能体协作方法依赖静态组织结构，难以适应任务复杂性和智能体数量的增长，导致协调效率低下。

Method: 采用强化学习训练一个中心化的“操纵者”，动态调度和优先排序智能体，形成灵活且可演化的集体推理结构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在封闭和开放场景中均表现优异，计算成本更低，且推理结构更紧凑、循环性更强。

Conclusion: 动态中心化调度策略显著提升了多智能体协作的效率，为复杂任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results across diverse
downstream tasks, but their monolithic nature restricts scalability and
efficiency in complex problem-solving. While recent research explores
multi-agent collaboration among LLMs, most approaches rely on static
organizational structures that struggle to adapt as task complexity and agent
numbers grow, resulting in coordination overhead and inefficiencies. To this
end, we propose a puppeteer-style paradigm for LLM-based multi-agent
collaboration, where a centralized orchestrator ("puppeteer") dynamically
directs agents ("puppets") in response to evolving task states. This
orchestrator is trained via reinforcement learning to adaptively sequence and
prioritize agents, enabling flexible and evolvable collective reasoning.
Experiments on closed- and open-domain scenarios show that this method achieves
superior performance with reduced computational costs. Analyses further reveal
that the key improvements consistently stem from the emergence of more compact,
cyclic reasoning structures under the orchestrator's evolution.

Motivation: 探索LALMs在恶意音频注入攻击下的鲁棒性，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过四种攻击场景（音频干扰、指令跟随、上下文注入和判断劫持）和多项指标（防御成功率、上下文鲁棒性评分等）定量评估模型。

Result: 实验显示模型性能差异大，无单一模型在所有攻击中表现最佳；恶意内容位置（如序列开头）显著影响攻击效果。

Conclusion: 需在训练中整合鲁棒性，开发多模态防御和解耦能力与脆弱性的架构设计，以提升LALMs安全性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, yet their robustness against malicious audio injection attacks
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates five leading LALMs
across four attack scenarios: Audio Interference Attack, Instruction Following
Attack, Context Injection Attack, and Judgment Hijacking Attack. Using metrics
like Defense Success Rate, Context Robustness Score, and Judgment Robustness
Index, their vulnerabilities and resilience were quantitatively assessed.
Experimental results reveal significant performance disparities among models;
no single model consistently outperforms others across all attack types. The
position of malicious content critically influences attack effectiveness,
particularly when placed at the beginning of sequences. A negative correlation
between instruction-following capability and robustness suggests models
adhering strictly to instructions may be more susceptible, contrasting with
greater resistance by safety-aligned models. Additionally, system prompts show
mixed effectiveness, indicating the need for tailored strategies. This work
introduces a benchmark framework and highlights the importance of integrating
robustness into training pipelines. Findings emphasize developing multi-modal
defenses and architectural designs that decouple capability from susceptibility
for secure LALMs deployment.

Motivation: 现有语言模型评估方法主要关注通用文本理解能力，但忽略了罕见语法点的表现，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 通过测量语言模型在日语“第一人称心理谓词限制”语法点上的困惑度，评估其表现，并分析分词对性能的影响。

Result: Weblab是唯一在7-10B参数范围内表现良好的开源模型，而Llama 3的困惑度可通过优化分词显著降低（28倍差异）。

Conclusion: 分词质量对语言模型在罕见语法点上的表现有重要影响，优化分词可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Typical methods for evaluating the performance of language models evaluate
their ability to answer questions accurately. These evaluation metrics are
acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand
and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced
capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare
grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the
perplexity of language models when confronted with the "first person psych
predicate restriction" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested
open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns
higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical
ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible
root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on
grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude
(28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly
well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine
translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in
order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the
most natural sentence from being output.

Conclusion: 语音基础模型中的跨语言对齐具有语义基础，可有效提升低资源语言语音识别性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment in pretrained language models (LMs) has enabled
efficient transfer in text-based LMs. Such an alignment has also been observed
in speech foundation models. However, it remains an open question whether
findings and methods from text-based cross-lingual alignment apply to speech.
Building on prior work on spoken translation retrieval, we perform
pronunciation-controlled experiments to observe if cross-lingual alignment can
indeed occur in such models on a semantic basis, instead of relying on phonetic
similarities. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of phonetic cues,
spoken translation retrieval accuracy remains relatively stable. We follow up
with a controlled experiment on a word-level dataset of cross-lingual synonyms
and near-homophones, confirming the existence of both phonetic and semantic
knowledge in the encoder. Finally, we qualitatively examine the transcriptions
produced by early exiting the encoder, where we observe that speech translation
produces semantic errors that are characterized by phonetic similarities to
corresponding words in the source language. We apply this insight from early
exiting to speech recognition in seven low-resource languages unsupported by
the Whisper model, and achieve improved accuracy in all languages examined,
particularly for languages with transparent orthographies.

Result: GPT-4o在无效多设备指令场景中成功率为0.0%，现有LLM表现不足。

Conclusion: LLM在复杂智能家居场景中仍需改进，HomeBench为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home
assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and
respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter
home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into
smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid
single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far
more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or
controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges:
LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and
execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and
advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce
HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions
across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results
on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the
scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing
state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the
help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DoctorAgent-RL通过强化学习机制，使LLMs能自主开发符合临床逻辑的交互策略，具有实际临床应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in the
field of biomedical question answering, but their application in real-world
clinical consultations still faces core challenges. Existing systems rely on a
one-way information transmission mode where patients must fully describe their
symptoms in a single round, leading to nonspecific diagnostic recommendations
when complaints are vague. Traditional multi-turn dialogue methods based on
supervised learning are constrained by static data-driven paradigms, lacking
generalizability and struggling to intelligently extract key clinical
information. To address these limitations, we propose DoctorAgent-RL, a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent collaborative framework that
models medical consultations as a dynamic decision-making process under
uncertainty. The doctor agent continuously optimizes its questioning strategy
within the RL framework through multi-turn interactions with the patient agent,
dynamically adjusting its information-gathering path based on comprehensive
rewards from the Consultation Evaluator. This RL fine-tuning mechanism enables
LLMs to autonomously develop interaction strategies aligned with clinical
reasoning logic, rather than superficially imitating patterns in existing
dialogue data. Notably, we constructed MTMedDialog, the first English
multi-turn medical consultation dataset capable of simulating patient
interactions. Experiments demonstrate that DoctorAgent-RL outperforms existing
models in both multi-turn reasoning capability and final diagnostic
performance, demonstrating practical value in assisting clinical consultations.

Result: LLMs能根据简单提示分词，参数越多的模型表现越好；LLACA方法显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在无监督分词任务中表现出潜力，LLACA方法为分词任务提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Word segmentation stands as a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Based on the concept of "comprehend first, segment later", we propose a
new framework to explore the limit of unsupervised word segmentation with Large
Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs based on word segmentation. We employ current mainstream LLMs to perform
word segmentation across multiple languages to assess LLMs' "comprehension".
Our findings reveal that LLMs are capable of following simple prompts to
segment raw text into words. There is a trend suggesting that models with more
parameters tend to perform better on multiple languages. Additionally, we
introduce a novel unsupervised method, termed LLACA ($\textbf{L}$arge
$\textbf{L}$anguage Model-Inspired $\textbf{A}$ho-$\textbf{C}$orasick
$\textbf{A}$utomaton). Leveraging the advanced pattern recognition capabilities
of Aho-Corasick automata, LLACA innovatively combines these with the deep
insights of well-pretrained LLMs. This approach not only enables the
construction of a dynamic $n$-gram model that adjusts based on contextual
information but also integrates the nuanced understanding of LLMs, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods. Our source code is available

Conclusion: 延迟感知的TTS在延迟敏感场景中能同时兼顾速度和准确性，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has
overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through
a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a
compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios
where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS,
we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1)
branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference
branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding.
By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources
properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3%
accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4%
within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and
demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in
latency-sensitive scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升推理效率与准确性，无需外部工具，且适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances large language models'
(LLM) reasoning capabilities. However, the extensive reasoning traces lead to
inefficiencies and an increased time-to-first-token (TTFT). We propose a novel
training paradigm that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to guide reasoning LLMs
to interleave thinking and answering for multi-hop questions. We observe that
models inherently possess the ability to perform interleaved reasoning, which
can be further enhanced through RL. We introduce a simple yet effective
rule-based reward to incentivize correct intermediate steps, which guides the
policy model toward correct reasoning paths by leveraging intermediate signals
generated during interleaved reasoning. Extensive experiments conducted across
five diverse datasets and three RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++)
demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional think-answer reasoning,
without requiring external tools. Specifically, our approach reduces TTFT by
over 80% on average and improves up to 19.3% in Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore,
our method, trained solely on question answering and logical reasoning
datasets, exhibits strong generalization ability to complex reasoning datasets
such as MATH, GPQA, and MMLU. Additionally, we conduct in-depth analysis to
reveal several valuable insights into conditional reward modeling.

Abstract: Automatic related work generation (RWG) can save people's time and effort
when writing a draft of related work section (RWS) for further revision.
However, existing methods for RWG always suffer from shallow comprehension due
to taking the limited portions of references papers as input and isolated
explanation for each reference due to ineffective capturing the relationships
among them. To address these issues, we focus on full-text-based RWG task and
propose a novel multi-agent framework. Our framework consists of three agents:
a selector that decides which section of the papers is going to read next, a
reader that digests the selected section and updates a shared working memory,
and a writer that generates RWS based on the final curated memory. To better
capture the relationships among references, we also propose two graph-aware
strategies for selector, enabling to optimize the reading order with constrains
of the graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
consistently improves performance across three base models and various input
configurations. The graph-aware selectors outperform alternative selectors,
achieving state-of-the-art results. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: GenKI显著提升了OpenQA性能，为知识整合和可控生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural
language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from
unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent
understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared
to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical
challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to
adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task
situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named
GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge
Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically,
we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge
from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge
integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions
during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable
generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based
on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format
assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO,
and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the
effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of
retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately
against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了LeCoDe数据集和评估框架，用于提升LLMs在法律咨询中的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并探索改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律咨询成本高且难以普及，LLMs虽具潜力但现有系统无法满足交互性和专业性需求。

Method: 构建LeCoDe数据集（3,696个对话，110,008轮次），提出包含12项指标的评估框架，测试多种LLMs。

Result: GPT-4在澄清能力上仅39.8%召回率，建议质量总体得分59%，显示任务复杂性。

Conclusion: LeCoDe推动了法律对话系统研究，需进一步优化LLMs的专业咨询能力。

Abstract: Legal consultation is essential for safeguarding individual rights and
ensuring access to justice, yet remains costly and inaccessible to many
individuals due to the shortage of professionals. While recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward scalable, low-cost
legal assistance, current systems fall short in handling the interactive and
knowledge-intensive nature of real-world consultations. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeCoDe, a real-world multi-turn benchmark dataset
comprising 3,696 legal consultation dialogues with 110,008 dialogue turns,
designed to evaluate and improve LLMs' legal consultation capability. With
LeCoDe, we innovatively collect live-streamed consultations from short-video
platforms, providing authentic multi-turn legal consultation dialogues. The
rigorous annotation by legal experts further enhances the dataset with
professional insights and expertise. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' consultation capabilities in terms of
(1) clarification capability and (2) professional advice quality. This unified
framework incorporates 12 metrics across two dimensions. Through extensive
experiments on various general and domain-specific LLMs, our results reveal
significant challenges in this task, with even state-of-the-art models like
GPT-4 achieving only 39.8% recall for clarification and 59% overall score for
advice quality, highlighting the complexity of professional consultation
scenarios. Based on these findings, we further explore several strategies to
enhance LLMs' legal consultation abilities. Our benchmark contributes to
advancing research in legal domain dialogue systems, particularly in simulating
more real-world user-expert interactions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督安全微调策略，以增强大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的安全性对齐，同时避免过度拒绝问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALMs在音频交互中存在安全性不足的问题，且缺乏针对性的安全对齐策略和数据集。

Method: 采用无监督安全微调策略，通过重塑模型表示空间来提升安全性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LALMs在多种输入模式下的安全性，且过度拒绝率仅平均增加0.88%。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效平衡了安全性和实用性，为LALMs的安全对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by enabling audio-based human interactions. However,
recent research has revealed that LALMs remain vulnerable to harmful queries
due to insufficient safety-alignment. Despite advances in defence measures for
text and vision LLMs, effective safety-alignment strategies and audio-safety
dataset specifically targeting LALMs are notably absent. Meanwhile defence
measures based on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) struggle to address safety
improvement while avoiding over-rejection issues, significantly compromising
helpfulness. In this work, we propose an unsupervised safety-fine-tuning
strategy as remedy that reshapes model's representation space to enhance
existing LALMs safety-alignment while balancing the risk of over-rejection. Our
experiments, conducted across three generations of Qwen LALMs, demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves LALMs safety under three modality input
conditions (audio-text, text-only, and audio-only) while increasing
over-rejection rate by only 0.88% on average. Warning: this paper contains
harmful examples.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过词关联分析LLM的道德价值观，避免直接提示的局限性，比较了英语社区与LLM的道德差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM反映的道德价值观的重要性日益增加，但直接提示方法存在数据泄露和敏感性等问题。

Method: 利用词关联作为底层表示，构建LLM生成的词关联数据集，并通过道德基础理论的种子词传播道德价值观。

Result: 揭示了英语社区与LLM在道德概念化上的系统性差异。

Conclusion: 词关联方法为LLM道德价值观分析提供了更稳健的视角。

Abstract: As the impact of large language models increases, understanding the moral
values they reflect becomes ever more important. Assessing the nature of moral
values as understood by these models via direct prompting is challenging due to
potential leakage of human norms into model training data, and their
sensitivity to prompt formulation. Instead, we propose to use word
associations, which have been shown to reflect moral reasoning in humans, as
low-level underlying representations to obtain a more robust picture of LLMs'
moral reasoning. We study moral differences in associations from western
English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data.
First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling
an existing data set of human word associations. Next, we propose a novel
method to propagate moral values based on seed words derived from Moral
Foundation Theory through the human and LLM-generated association graphs.
Finally, we compare the resulting moral conceptualizations, highlighting
detailed but systematic differences between moral values emerging from English
speakers and LLM associations.

TL;DR: 论文提出SiDyP方法，通过动态先验的单纯形标签扩散技术，提升模型对LLM生成噪声标签的鲁棒性，显著提高分类器性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统标注数据集成本高，LLM自动生成标签虽提供新途径，但其噪声问题影响模型泛化能力，需解决。

Method: SiDyP利用文本嵌入空间的邻域标签分布检索潜在真实标签，并通过单纯形扩散模型迭代优化噪声标签。

Result: 在零样本和少样本LLM生成噪声标签数据集上，BERT分类器性能平均提升7.21%和7.30%。

Conclusion: SiDyP有效提升模型对LLM噪声标签的鲁棒性，适用于多种NLP任务和LLM模型。

Abstract: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and
expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs)
have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to
such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such
auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent
inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is
likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While
previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise
and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In
this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to
calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards
LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by
neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines
noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase
the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and
few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30%
respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive
benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is
available on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件点互信息（C-PMI）的解码策略，通过增强生成文本与输入图像之间的依赖关系，减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型容易产生与输入图像无关的幻觉响应，主要原因是模型过度依赖语言先验而忽视视觉信息。

Method: 提出C-PMI校准解码策略，通过联合建模视觉和文本标记的贡献，将幻觉缓解问题转化为双层次优化问题，并设计动态调节解码过程的标记净化机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著减少了LVLM的幻觉问题，同时保持了解码效率。

Conclusion: C-PMI解码策略有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，为视觉语言模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations, where
generated responses seem semantically plausible yet exhibit little or no
relevance to the input image. Previous studies reveal that this issue primarily
stems from LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors while disregarding the
visual information during decoding. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
novel Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) calibrated decoding
strategy, which adaptively strengthens the mutual dependency between generated
texts and input images to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing methods
solely focusing on text token sampling, we propose to jointly model the
contributions of visual and textual tokens to C-PMI, formulating hallucination
mitigation as a bi-level optimization problem aimed at maximizing mutual
information. To solve it, we design a token purification mechanism that
dynamically regulates the decoding process by sampling text tokens remaining
maximally relevant to the given image, while simultaneously refining image
tokens most pertinent to the generated response. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks reveal that the proposed method significantly reduces
hallucinations in LVLMs while preserving decoding efficiency.

TL;DR: KIT提交了IWSLT 2025低资源赛道的系统，包括级联（ASR+MT）和端到端（E2E）语音翻译（ST）系统，针对Bemba、北黎凡特阿拉伯语和突尼斯阿拉伯语到英语。通过预训练模型微调、合成数据增强和模型正则化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言对的语音翻译问题，探索如何高效利用有限资源提升系统性能。

Method: 结合预训练模型微调、合成数据生成（ASR数据通过MT模型生成翻译，MT数据通过TTS生成语音）、模型正则化（如intra-distillation）和Minimum Bayes Risk解码。

Result: 北黎凡特阿拉伯语仅用合成数据的系统略优于真实数据的级联系统；合成数据显著提升Bemba的ASR和ST性能；intra-distillation在ASR、MT和ST任务中均有效；级联与E2E系统结合提升约1.5 BLEU。

Conclusion: 合成数据和模型正则化是低资源语言对的有效策略，结合不同系统可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper presents KIT's submissions to the IWSLT 2025 low-resource track.
We develop both cascaded systems, consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) models, and end-to-end (E2E) Speech
Translation (ST) systems for three language pairs: Bemba, North Levantine
Arabic, and Tunisian Arabic into English. Building upon pre-trained models, we
fine-tune our systems with different strategies to utilize resources
efficiently. This study further explores system enhancement with synthetic data
and model regularization. Specifically, we investigate MT-augmented ST by
generating translations from ASR data using MT models. For North Levantine,
which lacks parallel ST training data, a system trained solely on synthetic
data slightly surpasses the cascaded system trained on real data. We also
explore augmentation using text-to-speech models by generating synthetic speech
from MT data, demonstrating the benefits of synthetic data in improving both
ASR and ST performance for Bemba. Additionally, we apply intra-distillation to
enhance model performance. Our experiments show that this approach consistently
improves results across ASR, MT, and ST tasks, as well as across different
pre-trained models. Finally, we apply Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to combine
the cascaded and end-to-end systems, achieving an improvement of approximately
1.5 BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAM的新方法，通过重要性采样实现LLM的对齐，提高了灵活性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法需要重新训练大型预训练模型，难以快速适应多样化应用需求。

Method: 将对齐过程形式化为重要性采样，上游未对齐模型作为提议分布，对齐模块作为重要性权重估计器。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RAM方法在灵活性和性能上优于传统对齐方法。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has
increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However,
traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models,
making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse
applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual
Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type
of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves
as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as
secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an
estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment
of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility
and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level
training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the
proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative
token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in
comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs
across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and
preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多跳和推理密集型任务（如数学问题解决）中容易产生幻觉，需要更精细的中间步骤评估方法。

Method: 提出PathFinder-PRM，结合数学和一致性错误的分类，利用400K样本数据集训练，实现分层错误检测和奖励估计。

Result: 在PRMBench上达到67.7的PRMScore，数据效率提升3倍；在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中提升1.5分。

Conclusion: 解耦错误检测和奖励估计不仅能提升细粒度错误检测，还能显著改进端到端数学推理的数据效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, especially during
multi-hop and reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematical problem solving.
While Outcome Reward Models verify only final answers, Process Reward Models
(PRMs) score each intermediate step to steer generation toward coherent
solutions. We introduce PathFinder-PRM, a novel hierarchical, error-aware
discriminative PRM that first classifies math and consistency errors at each
step, then combines these fine-grained signals to estimate step correctness. To
train PathFinder-PRM, we construct a 400K-sample dataset by enriching the
human-annotated PRM800K corpus and RLHFlow Mistral traces with
three-dimensional step-level labels. On PRMBench, PathFinder-PRM achieves a new
state-of-the-art PRMScore of 67.7, outperforming the prior best (65.5) while
using 3 times less data. When applied to reward guided greedy search, our model
yields prm@8 48.3, a +1.5 point gain over the strongest baseline. These results
demonstrate that decoupled error detection and reward estimation not only boost
fine-grained error detection but also substantially improve end-to-end,
reward-guided mathematical reasoning with greater data efficiency.

TL;DR: MT$^{3}$是首个将多任务强化学习应用于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的端到端文本图像机器翻译（TIMT）框架，通过多任务优化和混合奖励机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIMT在无障碍访问、跨语言信息获取和现实文档理解中至关重要，但现有方法依赖多阶段流水线，复杂度高。

Method: MT$^{3}$采用多任务优化范式，结合文本识别、上下文推理和翻译，并使用多混合奖励机制进行训练。

Result: MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero在MIT-10M基准测试中表现优异，超越多个强基线模型，并展现出对分布外数据的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多任务协同、强化学习初始化、课程设计和奖励机制是推动MLLM驱动TIMT的关键因素。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT)-the task of translating textual content
embedded in images-is critical for applications in accessibility, cross-lingual
information access, and real-world document understanding. However, TIMT
remains a complex challenge due to the need for accurate optical character
recognition (OCR), robust visual-text reasoning, and high-quality translation,
often requiring cascading multi-stage pipelines. Recent advances in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have improved reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), but their application to end-to-end TIMT is
still underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT$^{3}$, the first
framework to apply Multi-Task RL to MLLMs for end-to-end TIMT. MT$^{3}$ adopts
a multi-task optimization paradigm targeting three key sub-skills: text
recognition, context-aware reasoning, and translation. It is trained using a
novel multi-mixed reward mechanism that adapts rule-based RL strategies to
TIMT's intricacies, offering fine-grained, non-binary feedback across tasks.
Furthermore, to facilitate the evaluation of TIMT in authentic cross-cultural
and real-world social media contexts, we introduced XHSPost, the first social
media TIMT benchmark. Our MT$^{3}$-7B-Zero achieves state-of-the-art results on
the latest in-domain MIT-10M benchmark, outperforming strong baselines such as
Qwen2.5-VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B by notable margins across multiple metrics.
Additionally, the model shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution
language pairs and datasets. In-depth analyses reveal how multi-task synergy,
reinforcement learning initialization, curriculum design, and reward
formulation contribute to advancing MLLM-driven TIMT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型中的部分知识可能对微调任务产生负面影响（负迁移），而现有优雅遗忘方法在生成式语言模型中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LWF框架，利用Fisher信息矩阵加权参数更新，计算遗忘置信度并定期遗忘高置信度知识。

Result: 实验表明，优雅遗忘可以提升微调性能，尽管知识交互机制尚未完全揭示。

Conclusion: LWF框架为生成式语言模型中的优雅遗忘提供了有效解决方案，提升了微调效果。

Abstract: Recently, the pretrain-finetune paradigm has become a cornerstone in various
deep learning areas. While in general the pre-trained model would promote both
effectiveness and efficiency of downstream tasks fine-tuning, studies have
shown that not all knowledge acquired during pre-training is beneficial. Some
of the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning
tasks, which is also known as negative transfer. To address this problem,
graceful forgetting has emerged as a promising approach. The core principle of
graceful forgetting is to enhance the learning plasticity of the target task by
selectively discarding irrelevant knowledge. However, this approach remains
underexplored in the context of generative language models, and it is often
challenging to migrate existing forgetting algorithms to these models due to
architecture incompatibility. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose a
novel framework, Learning With Forgetting (LWF), to achieve graceful forgetting
in generative language models. With Fisher Information Matrix weighting the
intended parameter updates, LWF computes forgetting confidence to evaluate
self-generated knowledge regarding the forgetting task, and consequently,
knowledge with high confidence is periodically unlearned during fine-tuning.
Our experiments demonstrate that, although thoroughly uncovering the mechanisms
of knowledge interaction remains challenging in pre-trained language models,
applying graceful forgetting can contribute to enhanced fine-tuning
performance.

Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，闭源LLM成本高且不稳定，RPDR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用闭源LLM生成训练数据，微调开源LLM进行候选重排序，实现知识蒸馏。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异，Aier和Ask A Patient数据集分别提升0.019和0.036 Acc@1。

Conclusion: RPDR框架在低资源场景下具有优越性和通用性。

Abstract: Biomedical entity linking aims to map nonstandard entities to standard
entities in a knowledge base. Traditional supervised methods perform well but
require extensive annotated data to transfer, limiting their usage in
low-resource scenarios. Large language models (LLMs), especially closed-source
LLMs, can address these but risk stability issues and high economic costs:
using these models is restricted by commercial companies and brings significant
economic costs when dealing with large amounts of data. To address this, we
propose ``RPDR'', a framework combining closed-source LLMs and open-source LLMs
for re-ranking candidates retrieved by a retriever fine-tuned with a small
amount of data. By prompting a closed-source LLM to generate training data from
unannotated data and fine-tuning an open-source LLM for re-ranking, we
effectively distill the knowledge to the open-source LLM that can be deployed
locally, thus avoiding the stability issues and the problem of high economic
costs. We evaluate RPDR on two datasets, including one real-world dataset and
one publicly available dataset involving two languages: Chinese and English.
RPDR achieves 0.019 Acc@1 improvement and 0.036 Acc@1 improvement on the Aier
dataset and the Ask A Patient dataset when the amount of training data is not
enough. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，如何高效且低成本地将其与人类偏好和价值观对齐成为关键挑战。现有方法（如RLHF或DPO）通常需要直接微调数十亿参数的LLMs，导致高昂的计算成本和低效。

Method: 提出MARA方法，通过一个紧凑的三层全连接网络对候选标记进行“接受”或“拒绝”的二元分类，从而简化对齐过程。

Result: 在七个不同LLMs和三个开源数据集上的实验表明，MARA显著提升了对齐性能并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: MARA为LLMs的对齐提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning these
models with human preferences and values is critical to ensuring ethical and
safe applications. However, existing alignment techniques such as RLHF or DPO
often require direct fine-tuning on LLMs with billions of parameters, resulting
in substantial computational costs and inefficiencies. To address this, we
propose Micro token-level Accept-Reject Aligning (MARA) approach designed to
operate independently of the language models. MARA simplifies the alignment
process by decomposing sentence-level preference learning into token-level
binary classification, where a compact three-layer fully-connected network
determines whether candidate tokens are "Accepted" or "Rejected" as part of the
response. Extensive experiments across seven different LLMs and three
open-source datasets show that MARA achieves significant improvements in
alignment performance while reducing computational costs.

Result: 在三个PDF问答数据集上表现优于传统向量检索和结构化基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuSym-RAG成功统一了神经和符号检索，并通过多视图利用提升了问答性能。

Abstract: The increasing number of academic papers poses significant challenges for
researchers to efficiently acquire key details. While retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based
automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic
retrieval despite their complementary strengths. Moreover, conventional
single-view chunking neglects the rich structure and layout of PDFs, e.g.,
sections and tables. In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural
symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive
process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG
organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and
vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient
to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including
a self-annotated one AIRQA-REAL, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the
vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to
unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views. Code and data are

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）性能优秀但token效率低，受无意识思维理论（UTT）启发，提出CoUT以提高效率。

Method: 1. 引导模型在隐藏层内部化推理；2. 设计token高效策略减少冗余token。

Result: CoUT比CoT减少47.62%的token使用，同时保持相近的准确性。

Conclusion: 模型可能具备有益的无意识思维，CoUT在提升效率的同时不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve promising performance but compromise
token efficiency due to verbose reasoning processes. Unconscious Thought Theory
(UTT) posits that complex problems can be solved more efficiently through
internalized cognitive processes. Inspired by UTT, we propose a new reasoning
paradigm, termed Chain of Unconscious Thought (CoUT), to improve the token
efficiency of LRMs by guiding them to mimic human unconscious thought and
internalize reasoning processes. Concretely, we first prompt the model to
internalize the reasoning by thinking in the hidden layer. Then, we design a
bag of token-efficient strategies to further help models reduce unnecessary
tokens yet preserve the performance. Our work reveals that models may possess
beneficial unconscious thought, enabling improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoUT. Remarkably, it surpasses CoT by reducing token usage by 47.62% while
maintaining comparable accuracy, as shown in Figure 1. The code of CoUT is
available at this link: https://github.com/Rohan-GRH/CoUT

*Masoomali Fatehkia,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGM框架通过用户定义的规范训练内容审核过滤器，支持多样化的对齐目标，性能与现有安全过滤器相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs经过广泛训练，但仍存在对齐不足和对对抗性输入的脆弱性，需要更灵活的审核机制。

Method: SGM框架基于用户定义规范自动生成训练数据，无需人工示例，支持细粒度对齐控制。

Result: SGM训练的过滤器性能与基于精选数据集的最先进安全过滤器相当。

Conclusion: SGM提供了一种灵活且可扩展的方法，用于满足多样化的LLM对齐需求。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with deployment-specific requirements
is critical but inherently imperfect. Despite extensive training, models remain
susceptible to misalignment and adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks. Content
moderation filters are commonly used as external safeguards, though they
typically focus narrowly on safety. We introduce SGM (Specification-Guided
Moderation), a flexible framework for training moderation filters grounded in
user-defined specifications that go beyond standard safety concerns. SGM
automates training data generation without relying on human-written examples,
enabling scalable support for diverse, application-specific alignment goals.
SGM-trained filters perform on par with state-of-the-art safety filters built
on curated datasets, while supporting fine-grained and user-defined alignment
control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T2Agent是一种新型的多模态虚假信息检测代理，结合可扩展工具包和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），通过动态证据收集和多源验证提升检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多模态虚假信息常来自混合伪造源，现有静态方法难以应对其复杂性和多样性。

Method: 提出T2Agent，包含模块化工具包和贝叶斯优化选择器，扩展MCTS以支持多源验证和双奖励机制。

Result: 在混合源多模态虚假信息基准测试中，T2Agent显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: T2Agent作为一种无需训练的方法，展示了在多源虚假信息检测中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources,
requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing
methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their
ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we
propose T2Agent, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an
extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of
modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis.
Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless
integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools
simultaneously, a Bayesian optimization-based selector is proposed to identify
a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to
dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better
align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, T2Agent
extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the
task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual
reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score
is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed
forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct
ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and
tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that T2Agent consistently
outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal
misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a
training-free approach for enhancing detection accuracy. The code will be
released.

TL;DR: 研究发现，长上下文（128K tokens）是大型语言模型（LLMs）安全漏洞的主要因素，即使使用重复或随机内容也能绕过安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在长上下文中的安全漏洞，揭示其安全机制的局限性。

Method: 通过多轮攻击（MSJ）实验，分析不同指令风格、密度、主题和格式对攻击效果的影响。

Result: 长上下文是攻击成功的关键因素，模型安全行为随上下文增长变得不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs的长上下文处理能力存在根本性缺陷，需开发新的安全机制。

Abstract: We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs)
through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of
up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack
settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we
reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack
effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require
carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text
can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in
long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of
well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts.
These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion
capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于熵的不一致性度量方法，分析LLM在政治内容中的偏见，发现模型对左翼和极右翼政客存在正负偏见，且西方语言偏见更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见分析方法依赖小规模任务和LLM自身分析，可能传播偏见，因此需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 通过插入1319个多样化政客名字到450个政治句子中，利用七个模型预测目标导向情感，定义熵度量分析不一致性。

Result: 发现所有测试组合均存在不一致性，西方语言偏见更强，大模型偏见更显著且一致。

Conclusion: 通过替换政客名字为虚构但合理的替代品，部分缓解了LLM在目标导向情感分类中的不可靠性。

Abstract: Political biases encoded by LLMs might have detrimental effects on downstream
applications. Existing bias analysis methods rely on small-size intermediate
tasks (questionnaire answering or political content generation) and rely on the
LLMs themselves for analysis, thus propagating bias. We propose a new approach
leveraging the observation that LLM sentiment predictions vary with the target
entity in the same sentence. We define an entropy-based inconsistency metric to
encode this prediction variability. We insert 1319 demographically and
politically diverse politician names in 450 political sentences and predict
target-oriented sentiment using seven models in six widely spoken languages. We
observe inconsistencies in all tested combinations and aggregate them in a
statistically robust analysis at different granularity levels. We observe
positive and negative bias toward left and far-right politicians and positive
correlations between politicians with similar alignment. Bias intensity is
higher for Western languages than for others. Larger models exhibit stronger
and more consistent biases and reduce discrepancies between similar languages.
We partially mitigate LLM unreliability in target-oriented sentiment
classification (TSC) by replacing politician names with fictional but plausible
counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大型专有语言模型的垄断，研究如何通过小型开源模型保持竞争力。

Method: 使用嵌入、聚类、评分和投票四个轻量级操作，结合多个小型模型生成响应。

Result: 在15个数据集的10个中超越GPT-4.1，数学任务提升18.21%，代码任务提升7.46%。

Conclusion: Avengers展示了小型开源模型的潜力，具有优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As proprietary giants increasingly dominate the race for ever-larger language
models, a pressing question arises for the open-source community: can smaller
models remain competitive across a broad range of tasks? In this paper, we
present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective
intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built
upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text
embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic
similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster;
and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference
time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The
top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the
response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably,
with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively
outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code,
logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on
mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the
Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains
robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble
strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters. We have
open-sourced the code on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhangYiqun018/Avengers

Motivation: 科学研究的快速增长需要高效的元数据提取方法，以促进数据集的编目和保存，而现有方法（如Masader）依赖手动标注。

Method: MOLE采用基于模式的方法，处理多种输入格式的文档，并结合验证机制，利用大语言模型进行自动化元数据提取。

Result: 实验表明，现代大语言模型在自动化元数据提取任务中表现良好，但仍需改进以确保一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MOLE为元数据提取提供了自动化解决方案，并呼吁未来进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: Metadata extraction is essential for cataloging and preserving datasets,
enabling effective research discovery and reproducibility, especially given the
current exponential growth in scientific research. While Masader (Alyafeai et
al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata
attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on
manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from
scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our
schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input
formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output.
Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on
this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning,
and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising
results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work
improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance. We release the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融法规的复杂性导致合规逻辑转换困难，现有RegTech和LLMs在中文金融法规上表现不佳，亟需领域专用数据集提升性能。

Method: 开发了Compliance-to-Code数据集，包含1,159条标注条款，涵盖10类法规，每条条款包含逻辑元素和Python代码映射。并提出了FinCheck流程，实现法规结构化、代码生成和报告生成。

Result: Compliance-to-Code数据集填补了中文金融法规领域的空白，FinCheck流程展示了其在自动化审计中的实用性。

Conclusion: Compliance-to-Code和FinCheck为中文金融法规的自动化合规逻辑转换提供了有效解决方案，提升了RegTech和LLMs的应用效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate
governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core,
financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered
logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in
labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent
Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained
significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into
executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal
particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to
three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation,
(2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to
maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a
domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing
datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often
English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for
compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code,
the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory
compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten
categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical
elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with
regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed
code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To
demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation
structuring, code generation, and report generation.

Abstract: Consciousness stands as one of the most profound and distinguishing features
of the human mind, fundamentally shaping our understanding of existence and
agency. As large language models (LLMs) develop at an unprecedented pace,
questions concerning intelligence and consciousness have become increasingly
significant. However, discourse on LLM consciousness remains largely unexplored
territory. In this paper, we first clarify frequently conflated terminologies
(e.g., LLM consciousness and LLM awareness). Then, we systematically organize
and synthesize existing research on LLM consciousness from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. Furthermore, we highlight potential frontier risks that
conscious LLMs might introduce. Finally, we discuss current challenges and
outline future directions in this emerging field. The references discussed in

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for comprehending the reasoning capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) through the perspective of meta-learning. By
conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to
the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various
meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks
as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and
reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting
model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops
fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen
questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection
between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of
significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only
enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical
insights for improving these models through established meta-learning
techniques.

Result: 实验以Llama 3.1为基础模型，通过广泛实验和消融研究，确定了最佳适配策略。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言适配LLM提供了有效方法，尤其适用于非洲语言。

Abstract: Researchers working on low-resource languages face persistent challenges due
to limited data availability and restricted access to computational resources.
Although most large language models (LLMs) are predominantly trained in
high-resource languages, adapting them to low-resource contexts, particularly
African languages, requires specialized techniques. Several strategies have
emerged for adapting models to low-resource languages in todays LLM landscape,
defined by multi-stage pre-training and post-training paradigms. However, the
most effective approaches remain uncertain. This work systematically
investigates which adaptation strategies yield the best performance when
extending existing LLMs to African languages. We conduct extensive experiments
and ablation studies to evaluate different combinations of data types
(translated versus synthetically generated), training stages (pre-training
versus post-training), and other model adaptation configurations. Our
experiments focuses on mathematical reasoning tasks, using the Llama 3.1 model
family as our base model.

Abstract: Transliteration, the process of mapping text from one script to another,
plays a crucial role in multilingual natural language processing, especially
within linguistically diverse contexts such as India. Despite significant
advancements through specialized models like IndicXlit, recent developments in
large language models suggest a potential for general-purpose models to excel
at this task without explicit task-specific training. The current work
systematically evaluates the performance of prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o,
GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1, Gemma-3-27B-it, and Mistral-Large against IndicXlit, a
state-of-the-art transliteration model, across ten major Indian languages.
Experiments utilized standard benchmarks, including Dakshina and Aksharantar
datasets, with performance assessed via Top-1 Accuracy and Character Error
Rate. Our findings reveal that while GPT family models generally outperform
other LLMs and IndicXlit for most instances. Additionally, fine-tuning GPT-4o
improves performance on specific languages notably. An extensive error analysis

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但存在过度推理导致高推理成本的问题。现有方法效率低下或牺牲性能。

Method: 引入小型反射模型进行在线训练，结合并行采样和顺序修订，并设计反射奖励以避免短但无反思的响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持或提升性能的同时，显著提高推理效率，减少35%的推理成本。

Conclusion: REA-RL在性能和效率间取得平衡，适用于不同难度任务，同时保持反思能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance in complex tasks
but often face the challenge of overthinking, leading to substantially high
inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for
LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming
data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement
learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses,
but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address
these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for
efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and
sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further
prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show
that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving
inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between
performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without
compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are
effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while
appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability.

Abstract: We present Adjacent Possible Exploration (APE), a simple yet effective method
for adapting large language models to specific tasks using minimal

batches (200 examples), retaining only improvements. On news summarization, APE
achieves 40 percent BLEU improvement using just a T4 GPU in 60 minutes,
matching or exceeding more complex methods like LoRA while remaining
conceptually simple. Our approach is particularly valuable for researchers and
practitioners with limited computational resources. We provide open-source code
and demonstrate APE's effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human
evaluation. While inspired by evolutionary theory's "adjacent possible", APE's
core insight has a very practical application: small, iterative data
perturbations can efficiently guide LLMs toward task-specific performance
without expensive retraining.

Conclusion: Enigmata为提升LLM的逻辑推理能力提供了统一且可控的框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, excel at
advanced reasoning tasks like math and coding via Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but still struggle with puzzles solvable by humans
without domain knowledge. We introduce Enigmata, the first comprehensive suite
tailored for improving LLMs with puzzle reasoning skills. It includes 36 tasks
across seven categories, each with 1) a generator that produces unlimited
examples with controllable difficulty and 2) a rule-based verifier for
automatic evaluation. This generator-verifier design supports scalable,
multi-task RL training, fine-grained analysis, and seamless RLVR integration.
We further propose Enigmata-Eval, a rigorous benchmark, and develop optimized
multi-task RLVR strategies. Our trained model, Qwen2.5-32B-Enigmata,
consistently surpasses o3-mini-high and o1 on the puzzle reasoning benchmarks
like Enigmata-Eval, ARC-AGI (32.8%), and ARC-AGI 2 (0.6%). It also generalizes
well to out-of-domain puzzle benchmarks and mathematical reasoning, with little
multi-tasking trade-off. When trained on larger models like Seed1.5-Thinking
(20B activated parameters and 200B total parameters), puzzle data from Enigmata
further boosts SoTA performance on advanced math and STEM reasoning tasks such
as AIME (2024-2025), BeyondAIME and GPQA (Diamond), showing nice generalization
benefits of Enigmata. This work offers a unified, controllable framework for

*Pooneh Mousavi,Yingzhi Wang,Mirco Ravanelli,Cem Subakan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的度量标准ALAS，用于评估LLMs中音频和文本模态的对齐质量，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLMs中音频和文本模态对齐质量的标准方法，因此需要一种新指标来量化这种对齐效果。

Method: 提出ALAS度量标准，通过分析音频和文本表示在transformer层中的相关性，验证其在两个任务（口语问答和情感识别）中的表现。

Result: ALAS在不同层和任务中表现一致，验证了其作为对齐质量评估指标的有效性。

Conclusion: ALAS是一种有效的度量标准，可用于评估LLMs中跨模态对齐质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Spoken Language Understanding
(SLU). Recent SLU models process audio directly by adapting speech input into
LLMs for better multimodal learning. A key consideration for these models is
the cross-modal alignment between text and audio modalities, which is a
telltale sign as to whether or not LLM is able to associate semantic meaning to
audio segments. While various methods exist for fusing these modalities, there
is no standard metric to evaluate alignment quality in LLMs. In this work, we
propose a new metric, ALAS (Automatic Latent Alignment Score). Our study
examines the correlation between audio and text representations across
transformer layers, for two different tasks (Spoken Question Answering and
Emotion Recognition). We showcase that our metric behaves as expected across
different layers and different tasks.

*Zhongzhan Huang,Guoming Ling,Shanshan Zhong,Hefeng Wu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对长文本数据的压缩方法，创建了低成本基准测试MiniLongBench，显著降低了评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本理解（LCU）基准测试存在冗余和高成本问题，需改进。

Method: 通过数据压缩方法修剪LongBench基准，创建MiniLongBench，包含237个测试样本。

Result: MiniLongBench将评估成本降至4.5%，同时保持与LongBench0.97的排名相关性。

Conclusion: MiniLongBench作为低成本基准，有望推动LLM长文本理解能力的研究。

Abstract: Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in
current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy
nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in
prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses.
Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks
exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In
this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text
data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU
benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237
test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through
empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average
evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an
average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore,
our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to
substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See

TL;DR: CP-Router是一种动态选择LLM或LRM的路由框架，通过Conformal Prediction和熵标准优化输出效率，减少token使用同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRM在处理简单查询时输出冗长，导致效率低下甚至准确性下降，需要一种动态选择模型的方法。

Method: 提出CP-Router框架，基于Conformal Prediction的预测不确定性和Full/Binary Entropy标准动态路由选择LLM或LRM。

Result: 在多项MCQA基准测试中，CP-Router显著减少token使用，同时保持或提升准确性，并验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: CP-Router是一种高效、通用的路由框架，适用于多种模型配对和任务，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly improved
long-chain reasoning capabilities over Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
LRMs often produce unnecessarily lengthy outputs even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiencies or even accuracy degradation compared to LLMs. To
overcome this, we propose CP-Router, a training-free and model-agnostic routing
framework that dynamically selects between an LLM and an LRM, demonstrated with
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts. The routing decision is
guided by the prediction uncertainty estimates derived via Conformal Prediction
(CP), which provides rigorous coverage guarantees. To further refine the
uncertainty differentiation across inputs, we introduce Full and Binary Entropy
(FBE), a novel entropy-based criterion that adaptively selects the appropriate
CP threshold. Experiments across diverse MCQA benchmarks, including
mathematics, logical reasoning, and Chinese chemistry, demonstrate that
CP-Router efficiently reduces token usage while maintaining or even improving
accuracy compared to using LRM alone. We also extend CP-Router to diverse model
pairings and open-ended QA, where it continues to demonstrate strong
performance, validating its generality and robustness.

*Kilian Sennrich,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了知识图谱在词典数据检索中的应用，提出了一种基于自然语言接口的解决方案，并通过实验比较了不同模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱虽能有效表示词典数据的语义结构，但SPARQL查询语言对非专家用户门槛较高，因此需要开发自然语言接口以降低使用难度。

Method: 通过构建多维分类法分析Wikidata词典数据本体模块的复杂性，并创建包含120万自然语言到SPARQL查询映射的模板数据集，实验测试了GPT-2、Phi-1.5和GPT-3.5-Turbo的性能。

Result: 实验显示，GPT-3.5-Turbo在泛化能力上表现最佳，表明模型规模和预训练多样性对适应性至关重要。

Conclusion: 尽管取得进展，但在泛化能力、处理多样化语言数据和扩展解决方案以应对词典知识表示的复杂性方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer an excellent solution for representing the
lexical-semantic structures of lexicographic data. However, working with the
SPARQL query language represents a considerable hurdle for many non-expert
users who could benefit from the advantages of this technology. This paper
addresses the challenge of creating natural language interfaces for
lexicographic data retrieval on knowledge graphs such as Wikidata. We develop a
multidimensional taxonomy capturing the complexity of Wikidata's lexicographic
data ontology module through four dimensions and create a template-based
dataset with over 1.2 million mappings from natural language utterances to
SPARQL queries. Our experiments with GPT-2 (124M), Phi-1.5 (1.3B), and
GPT-3.5-Turbo reveal significant differences in model capabilities. While all
models perform well on familiar patterns, only GPT-3.5-Turbo demonstrates
meaningful generalization capabilities, suggesting that model size and diverse
pre-training are crucial for adaptability in this domain. However, significant
challenges remain in achieving robust generalization, handling diverse
linguistic data, and developing scalable solutions that can accommodate the
full complexity of lexicographic knowledge representation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepDialogue是一个大规模多模态对话数据集，涵盖41个领域和20种情感，旨在解决现有对话数据在情感范围、领域多样性和多轮对话深度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话数据集在情感范围、领域多样性和多轮对话深度上存在局限，且多为纯文本，阻碍了更人性化多模态对话系统的发展。

Method: 通过结合9种语言模型生成初始对话，并经过人工标注和LLM质量过滤，构建了包含40,150个高质量多轮对话的数据集。

Result: 研究发现：小模型在6轮对话后难以保持连贯性；具体领域对话更有意义；跨模型交互比同模型对话更连贯。

Conclusion: DeepDialogue首次提供了情感一致的多模态对话数据集，为多轮对话研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in single-turn responses, yet multi-turn dialogues remain
challenging for even the most sophisticated language models. Current dialogue
datasets are limited in their emotional range, domain diversity, turn depth,
and are predominantly text-only, hindering progress in developing more
human-like conversational systems across modalities. To address these
limitations, we present DeepDialogue, a large-scale multimodal dataset
containing 40,150 high-quality multi-turn dialogues spanning 41 domains and
incorporating 20 distinct emotions with coherent emotional progressions. Our
approach pairs 9 different language models (4B-72B parameters) to generate
65,600 initial conversations, which we then evaluate through a combination of
human annotation and LLM-based quality filtering. The resulting dataset reveals
fundamental insights: smaller models fail to maintain coherence beyond 6
dialogue turns; concrete domains (e.g., "cars," "travel") yield more meaningful
conversations than abstract ones (e.g., "philosophy"); and cross-model
interactions produce more coherent dialogues than same-model conversations. A
key contribution of DeepDialogue is its speech component, where we synthesize
emotion-consistent voices for all 40,150 dialogues, creating the first
large-scale open-source multimodal dialogue dataset that faithfully preserves
emotional context across multi-turn conversations.

Motivation: 探索结构化推理是否能提升跨领域翻译质量，填补LLMs在复杂领域翻译中的研究空白。

Method: 使用自动指标和增强的MQM评估体系，结合任务难度、输入长度和术语密度等因素，对比LRMs与LLMs的表现。

Result: LRMs在语义复杂领域（如长文本和高难度任务）表现优于LLMs，且领域自适应提示策略进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 结构化推理在领域敏感翻译任务中具有潜力，为优化翻译系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
general-purpose machine translation, but their effectiveness in complex,
domain-sensitive translation tasks remains underexplored. Recent advancements
in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), raise the question of whether structured
reasoning can enhance translation quality across diverse domains. In this work,
we compare the performance of LRMs with traditional LLMs across 15
representative domains and four translation directions. Our evaluation
considers various factors, including task difficulty, input length, and
terminology density. We use a combination of automatic metrics and an enhanced
MQM-based evaluation hierarchy to assess translation quality. Our findings show
that LRMs consistently outperform traditional LLMs in semantically complex
domains, especially in long-text and high-difficulty translation scenarios.
Moreover, domain-adaptive prompting strategies further improve performance by
better leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LRMs. These results highlight
the potential of structured reasoning in MDMT tasks and provide valuable
insights for optimizing translation systems in domain-sensitive contexts.

Motivation: 提高自动语音识别（ASR）系统在非母语多口音低资源环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用混合多个口音专用LoRA专家的方法（MAS-LoRA），无需在推理时重新微调模型。

Result: 在未知口音情况下，相比常规LoRA和全微调，词错误率显著降低；已知口音时效果更佳，且灾难性遗忘现象更少。

Conclusion: MAS-LoRA是首个将混合LoRA专家用于非母语多口音ASR的方法，效果显著。

Abstract: We aim to improve the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
systems against non-native speech, particularly in low-resourced multi-accent
settings. We introduce Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA), a
fine-tuning method that leverages a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
experts, each specialized in a specific accent. This method can be used when
the accent is known or unknown at inference time, without the need to fine-tune
the model again. Our experiments, conducted using Whisper on the L2-ARCTIC
corpus, demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate compared to
regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent
is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less
catastrophic forgetting than the other fine-tuning methods. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first use of a mixture of LoRA experts for non-native
multi-accent ASR.

Abstract: Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for

salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can
substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant
improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live,
and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning
skill enhancement for web agents.

Abstract: The detection of mental health problems from social media and the
interpretation of these results have been extensively explored. Research has
shown that incorporating clinical symptom information into a model enhances
domain expertise, improving its detection and interpretation performance. While
large language models (LLMs) are shown to be effective for generating
explanatory rationales in mental health detection, their substantially large
parameter size and high computational cost limit their practicality. Reasoning
distillation transfers this ability to smaller language models (SLMs), but
inconsistencies in the relevance and domain alignment of LLM-generated
rationales pose a challenge. This paper investigates how rationale quality
impacts SLM performance in mental health detection and explanation generation.
We hypothesize that ensuring high-quality and domain-relevant rationales
enhances the distillation. To this end, we propose a framework that selects
rationales based on their alignment with expert clinical reasoning. Experiments
show that our quality-focused approach significantly enhances SLM performance
in both mental disorder detection and rationale generation. This work
highlights the importance of rationale quality and offers an insightful
framework for knowledge transfer in mental health applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的编码系统最优性类别，该类成员与最优编码线性分离并呈现Zipf定律。人类语言属于此类，而其他物种的通信系统可能不符合。研究支持Zipf定律源于压缩的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索编码系统的最优性类别及其与Zipf定律的关系，验证Zipf定律是否源于压缩。

Method: 通过分析频率与排名的双对数图，识别线性分离的编码系统，并比较不同通信系统的分布特性。

Result: 人类语言符合该类最优性，呈现Zipf定律；其他物种的通信系统可能不符合。双对数图中的直线表明编码接近最优。

Conclusion: 研究支持Zipf定律源于压缩的假设，并揭示了编码系统的最优性与Zipf定律的关联。

Abstract: Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that
class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law,
namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's
law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like
structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All
languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of
the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that
cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution
instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into
plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a
straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under
non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a
linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under
compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may
indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide
support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.

Motivation: 现有工具学习方法通常依赖监督微调，但忽视了工具调用细节的细粒度优化，导致偏好对齐和错误判别能力受限。

Method: TTPA框架包括反向数据集构建（reversed dataset construction）、细粒度偏好采样（Token-level Preference Sampling, TPS）和错误导向评分机制（Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism, ESM）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，TTPA显著提升了工具使用性能，并展现出强大的跨模型和跨数据集的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TTPA通过细粒度优化和错误导向评分，有效提升了工具学习的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing tool-learning methods usually rely on supervised fine-tuning, they
often overlook fine-grained optimization of internal tool call details, leading
to limitations in preference alignment and error discrimination. To overcome
these challenges, we propose Token-level Tool-use Preference Alignment Training
Framework (TTPA), a training paradigm for constructing token-level tool-use
preference datasets that align LLMs with fine-grained preferences using a novel
error-oriented scoring mechanism. TTPA first introduces reversed dataset
construction, a method for creating high-quality, multi-turn tool-use datasets
by reversing the generation flow. Additionally, we propose Token-level
Preference Sampling (TPS) to capture fine-grained preferences by modeling
token-level differences during generation. To address biases in scoring, we
introduce the Error-oriented Scoring Mechanism (ESM), which quantifies
tool-call errors and can be used as a training signal. Extensive experiments on
three diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTPA significantly improves
tool-using performance while showing strong generalization ability across
models and datasets.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的智能体依赖封闭模型和复杂提示工程，开源模型通过专家轨迹训练存在性能瓶颈和错误传播问题。

Method: 提出STeP方法，合成自反轨迹（含错误反思与修正），并引入部分掩码策略避免学习次优步骤。

Result: 实验表明，STeP在ALFWorld、WebShop和SciWorld任务中提升性能，LLaMA2-7B-Chat使用Qwen1.5-110B-Chat作为教师模型时，训练数据更少但效果更优。

Conclusion: STeP通过自反轨迹和部分掩码策略，有效提升LLM智能体的学习能力，减少对封闭模型的依赖。

Abstract: Autonomous agents, which perceive environments and take actions to achieve
goals, have become increasingly feasible with the advancements in large
language models (LLMs). However, current powerful agents often depend on
sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4.
Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher
models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still
faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To
mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving
LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that
include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the
effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to
become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce
partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or
suboptimal steps. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves agent
performance across three representative tasks: ALFWorld, WebShop, and SciWorld.
For the open-source model LLaMA2-7B-Chat, when trained using self-reflected
trajectories constructed with Qwen1.5-110B-Chat as the teacher model, it
achieves comprehensive improvements with less training data compared to agents
trained exclusively on expert trajectories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉问题，现有不确定性量化方法计算开销高或依赖监督学习。

Method: 提出RAUQ，利用Transformer中特定“不确定性感知”头的注意力模式，通过单次前向传播计算序列级不确定性分数。

Result: 在4种LLM和12项任务中，RAUQ表现优异，计算开销低（<1%延迟），无需任务标签或超参数调优。

Conclusion: RAUQ为白盒LLMs提供即插即用的实时幻觉检测方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive fluency, but often produce
critical errors known as "hallucinations". Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
methods are a promising tool for coping with this fundamental shortcoming. Yet,
existing UQ methods face challenges such as high computational overhead or
reliance on supervised learning. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In
particular, we propose RAUQ (Recurrent Attention-based Uncertainty
Quantification), an unsupervised approach that leverages intrinsic attention
patterns in transformers to detect hallucinations efficiently. By analyzing
attention weights, we identified a peculiar pattern: drops in attention to
preceding tokens are systematically observed during incorrect generations for
certain "uncertainty-aware" heads. RAUQ automatically selects such heads,
recurrently aggregates their attention weights and token-level confidences, and
computes sequence-level uncertainty scores in a single forward pass.
Experiments across 4 LLMs and 12 question answering, summarization, and
translation tasks demonstrate that RAUQ yields excellent results, outperforming
state-of-the-art UQ methods using minimal computational overhead (<1% latency).
Moreover, it requires no task-specific labels and no careful hyperparameter
tuning, offering plug-and-play real-time hallucination detection in white-box
LLMs.

Conclusion: 通过不确定性量化和选择性验证，LLM驱动的形式化可以成为可靠的工程学科。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable promise for democratizing
automated reasoning by generating formal specifications. However, a fundamental
tension exists: LLMs are probabilistic, while formal verification demands
deterministic guarantees. This paper addresses this epistemological gap by
comprehensively investigating failure modes and uncertainty quantification (UQ)
in LLM-generated formal artifacts. Our systematic evaluation of five frontier
LLMs reveals Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based autoformalization's
domain-specific impact on accuracy (from +34.8% on logical tasks to -44.5% on
factual ones), with known UQ techniques like the entropy of token probabilities
failing to identify these errors. We introduce a probabilistic context-free
grammar (PCFG) framework to model LLM outputs, yielding a refined uncertainty
taxonomy. We find uncertainty signals are task-dependent (e.g., grammar entropy
for logic, AUROC>0.93). Finally, a lightweight fusion of these signals enables
selective verification, drastically reducing errors (14-100%) with minimal
abstention, transforming LLM-driven formalization into a reliable engineering
discipline.

Result: 弱监督能显著提升学生模型的推理性能，恢复约94%的强化学习增益，且成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 弱到强的监督范式是一种经济且通用的替代方案，可有效激励LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, but enhancing their reasoning abilities typically
relies on either reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable signals or
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT)
demonstrations, both of which are expensive. In this paper, we study a novel
problem of incentivizing the reasoning capacity of LLMs without expensive
high-quality demonstrations and reinforcement learning. We investigate whether
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be effectively incentivized via
supervision from significantly weaker models. We further analyze when and why
such weak supervision succeeds in eliciting reasoning abilities in stronger
models. Our findings show that supervision from significantly weaker reasoners
can substantially improve student reasoning performance, recovering close to
94% of the gains of expensive RL at a fraction of the cost. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks and model architectures demonstrate that weak reasoners can

improving performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Our results

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的简单有效算法，用于在推理时对齐大型语言模型与人类反馈，通过连续潜在空间中的梯度采样优化原始响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在基础策略较弱或候选集较小时难以探索信息丰富的候选响应，导致效果有限。

Method: SEA通过连续潜在空间中的梯度采样直接优化原始响应，避免了离散空间中的昂贵搜索。

Result: SEA在AdvBench和MATH数据集上分别实现了77.51%和16.36%的相对改进。

Conclusion: SEA是一种简单且有效的推理时对齐算法，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has
received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on
generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward
model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space.
However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base
policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited
effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy
Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for
inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete
space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the
optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space.
Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure
on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the
optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite
its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative
improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on
MATH. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yuanyige/SEA

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化方法，通过LLM生成基于概念的解释，用于理解偏好机制，并在多领域预测偏好时表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好机制（如人类偏好、LLM-as-a-Judge和奖励模型）在LLM对齐和评估中至关重要，但其驱动概念尚不明确。

Method: 使用LLM发现区分选择与拒绝响应的概念，并用概念向量表示；提出白盒层次多领域回归模型建模概念与偏好的关系。

Result: 在八个领域的评估中，方法在偏好预测上表现优异，且具有可解释性；应用概念指导LLM输出和提升LaaJ预测。

Conclusion: 为LLM时代的可解释性提供了新范式。

Abstract: Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and
reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models
(LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly
understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated end-to-end method for
generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across
multiple domains. Our method employs an LLM to discover concepts that
differentiate between chosen and rejected responses and represent them with
concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and
preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model
that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our
method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and
explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction
performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable.
Additionally, we assess explanations in two novel application-driven settings.
First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields
responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with
concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our
work provides a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MA-RAG是一个多代理框架，通过协作的AI代理解决复杂信息检索任务中的模糊性和推理挑战，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG方法在模糊查询、稀疏证据和多源信息整合中的不足。

Method: 采用多代理协作（Planner、Step Definer、Extractor、QA Agents），通过任务分解和链式推理逐步优化检索与合成。

Result: 在多跳和模糊QA基准测试中表现优于无训练基线，媲美微调系统。

Conclusion: MA-RAG通过代理协作实现了高效、可解释的RAG，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We present MA-RAG, a Multi-Agent framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) that addresses the inherent ambiguities and reasoning challenges in
complex information-seeking tasks. Unlike conventional RAG methods that rely on
either end-to-end fine-tuning or isolated component enhancements, MA-RAG
orchestrates a collaborative set of specialized AI agents: Planner, Step
Definer, Extractor, and QA Agents, to tackle each stage of the RAG pipeline
with task-aware reasoning. Ambiguities may arise from underspecified queries,
sparse or indirect evidence in retrieved documents, or the need to integrate
information scattered across multiple sources. MA-RAG mitigates these
challenges by decomposing the problem into subtasks, such as query
disambiguation, evidence extraction, and answer synthesis, and dispatching them
to dedicated agents equipped with chain-of-thought prompting. These agents
communicate intermediate reasoning and progressively refine the retrieval and
synthesis process. Our design allows fine-grained control over information flow
without any model fine-tuning. Crucially, agents are invoked on demand,
enabling a dynamic and efficient workflow that avoids unnecessary computation.
This modular and reasoning-driven architecture enables MA-RAG to deliver
robust, interpretable results. Experiments on multi-hop and ambiguous QA
benchmarks demonstrate that MA-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art training-free
baselines and rivals fine-tuned systems, validating the effectiveness of
collaborative agent-based reasoning in RAG.

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
sensitive to nuances in prompt templates, requiring careful prompt engineering,
adding costs in terms of computing and human effort. In this study, we present
experiments encompassing multiple LLMs variants of varying sizes aimed at
probing their preference with different prompts. Through experiments on
Question Answering, we show prompt preference consistency across LLMs of
different sizes. We also show that this consistency extends to other tasks,
such as Natural Language Inference. Utilizing this consistency, we propose a
method to use a smaller model to select effective prompt templates for a larger
model. We show that our method substantially reduces the cost of prompt
engineering while consistently matching performance with optimal prompts among
candidates. More importantly, our experiment shows the efficacy of our strategy
across fourteen LLMs and its applicability to a broad range of NLP tasks,
highlighting its robustness

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
question-answering (QA) tasks because of their superior capabilities in natural
language understanding and generation. However, LLM-based QA struggles with
complex QA tasks due to poor reasoning capacity, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations. Several recent works synthesize LLMs and knowledge graphs (KGs)

structured taxonomy that categorizes the methodology of synthesizing LLMs and
KGs for QA according to the categories of QA and the KG's role when integrating
with LLMs. We systematically survey state-of-the-art advances in synthesizing
LLMs and KGs for QA and compare and analyze these approaches in terms of
strength, limitations, and KG requirements. We then align the approaches with
QA and discuss how these approaches address the main challenges of different
complex QA. Finally, we summarize the advancements, evaluation metrics, and
benchmark datasets and highlight open challenges and opportunities.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了大型语言模型在实际应用中的推理实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in handling
complex tasks through long-chain reasoning. However, the extensive reasoning
steps involved can significantly increase computational costs, posing
challenges for real-world deployment. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing
reasoning efficiency by shortening the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
processes through various approaches, such as length-aware prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning on CoT data with variable lengths, and reinforcement
learning with length penalties. Although these methods effectively reduce
reasoning length, they still necessitate an initial reasoning phase. More
recent approaches have attempted to integrate long-chain and short-chain
reasoning abilities into a single model, yet they still rely on manual control
to toggle between short and long CoT.In this work, we propose a novel approach
that autonomously switches between short and long reasoning chains based on
problem complexity. Our method begins with supervised fine-tuning of the base
model to equip both long-chain and short-chain reasoning abilities. We then
employ reinforcement learning to further balance short and long CoT generation
while maintaining accuracy through two key strategies: first, integrating
reinforcement learning with a long-short adaptive group-wise reward strategy to
assess prompt complexity and provide corresponding rewards; second,
implementing a logit-based reasoning mode switching loss to optimize the
model's initial token choice, thereby guiding the selection of the reasoning
type.Evaluations on mathematical datasets demonstrate that our model can
dynamically switch between long-chain and short-chain reasoning modes without
substantially sacrificing performance. This advancement enhances the
practicality of reasoning in large language models for real-world applications.

Abstract: Suicidal risk detection in adolescents is a critical challenge, yet existing
methods rely on language-specific models, limiting scalability and
generalization. This study introduces a novel language-agnostic framework for
suicidal risk assessment with large language models (LLMs). We generate Chinese
transcripts from speech using an ASR model and then employ LLMs with
prompt-based queries to extract suicidal risk-related features from these
transcripts. The extracted features are retained in both Chinese and English to
enable cross-linguistic analysis and then used to fine-tune corresponding
pretrained language models independently. Experimental results show that our
method achieves performance comparable to direct fine-tuning with ASR results
or to models trained solely on Chinese suicidal risk-related features,
demonstrating its potential to overcome language constraints and improve the
robustness of suicidal risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的尺寸和内存需求限制了实际部署，需要高效的压缩策略。当前SVD方法忽略截断残差矩阵，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出ResSVD方法，利用截断残差矩阵减少损失，并在固定压缩比下选择性压缩最后几层以减少误差传播。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准数据集上的评估表明，ResSVD性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ResSVD是一种高效的LLM压缩方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a
wide range of downstream natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, their
considerable sizes and memory demands hinder practical deployment, underscoring
the importance of developing efficient compression strategies. Singular value
decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into orthogonal components, enabling
efficient low-rank approximation. This is particularly suitable for LLM
compression, where weight matrices often exhibit significant redundancy.
However, current SVD-based methods neglect the residual matrix from truncation,
resulting in significant truncation loss. Additionally, compressing all layers
of the model results in severe performance degradation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ResSVD, a new post-training SVD-based LLM compression
method. Specifically, we leverage the residual matrix generated during the
truncation process to reduce truncation loss. Moreover, under a fixed overall
compression ratio, we selectively compress the last few layers of the model,
which mitigates error propagation and significantly improves the performance of
compressed models.Comprehensive evaluations of ResSVD on diverse LLM families
and multiple benchmark datasets indicate that ResSVD consistently achieves
superior performance over existing counterpart methods, demonstrating its
practical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文本（如拼写变体、碎片化结构等）在数字化和NER任务中的挑战，填补意大利文本评估的空白。

Method: 构建了一个包含2,899个实体引用的19世纪意大利学者笔记数据集，并对比了领域特定BERT模型与LLM（如LLaMa3.1）的表现。

Result: 指令调优的LLM在处理历史人文文本时表现不佳，而微调的NER模型（尤其是针对特定领域）表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域的微调模型在历史文本NER任务中优于通用LLM，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The increased digitization of world's textual heritage poses significant
challenges for both computer science and literary studies. Overall, there is an
urgent need of computational techniques able to adapt to the challenges of
historical texts, such as orthographic and spelling variations, fragmentary
structure and digitization errors. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized natural language processing, suggesting promising applications
for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on historical documents. In spite of this,
no thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries
to fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction
based on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's
Zibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary
works. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both
domain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1.
Results show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties
handling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more
robust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic
references.

Conclusion: TrojanStego揭示了一类新型LLM数据泄露攻击，具有被动性、隐蔽性和危险性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into sensitive workflows,
concerns grow over their potential to leak confidential information. We propose
TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to
embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic
steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We
introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to
evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a
practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs
via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably
transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over
97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they
maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These
results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are
passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，EXSEARCH显著优于基线（如准确匹配分数提升7.8%）。

Conclusion: EXSEARCH及其扩展EXSEARCH-Zoo展示了在复杂检索任务中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely integrated into information
retrieval to advance traditional techniques. However, effectively enabling LLMs
to seek accurate knowledge in complex tasks remains a challenge due to the
complexity of multi-hop queries as well as the irrelevant retrieved content. To
address these limitations, we propose EXSEARCH, an agentic search framework,
where the LLM learns to retrieve useful information as the reasoning unfolds
through a self-incentivized process. At each step, the LLM decides what to
retrieve (thinking), triggers an external retriever (search), and extracts
fine-grained evidence (recording) to support next-step reasoning. To enable LLM
with this capability, EXSEARCH adopts a Generalized Expectation-Maximization
algorithm. In the E-step, the LLM generates multiple search trajectories and
assigns an importance weight to each; the M-step trains the LLM on them with a
re-weighted loss function. This creates a self-incentivized loop, where the LLM
iteratively learns from its own generated data, progressively improving itself
for search. We further theoretically analyze this training process,
establishing convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on four
knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that EXSEARCH substantially outperforms
baselines, e.g., +7.8% improvement on exact match score. Motivated by these
promising results, we introduce EXSEARCH-Zoo, an extension that extends our
method to broader scenarios, to facilitate future work.

Result: 实验表明，AweDist在多种开放权重模型中优于强基线。

Conclusion: AweDist能高效学习新词嵌入，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Current language models rely on static vocabularies determined at pretraining
time, which can lead to decreased performance and increased computational cost
for domains underrepresented in the original vocabulary. New tokens can be
added to solve this problem, when coupled with a good initialization for their
new embeddings. However, existing embedding initialization methods either
require expensive further training or pretraining of additional modules. In
this paper, we propose AweDist and show that by distilling representations
obtained using the original tokenization, we can quickly learn high-quality
input embeddings for new tokens. Experimental results with a wide range of
open-weight models show that AweDist is able to outperform even strong
baselines.

Conclusion: SeMe为模型合并提供了新范式，并揭示了语言模型的语义结构。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of Language Models (LMs) across diverse
tasks, no single model consistently outperforms others, necessitating efficient
methods to combine their strengths without expensive retraining. Existing model
merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often
rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge,
limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based
Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent
semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike
prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly
stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through
extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate
that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while
eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure
of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.

Result: 在GLUE和E2E等基准测试中表现优异，计算和存储效率优于LoRA和VeRA。

Conclusion: UORA为LLMs的微调提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的新范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces Uniform Orthogonal Reinitialization Adaptation (UORA),
a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach for Large Language
Models (LLMs). UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter
efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number
of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA
employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively
reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the
vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable
parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate
UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with
negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and
E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language
models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new
paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的规模和推理成本高，现有剪枝方法在同时减少宽度和深度时性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Pangu Light框架，结合结构化剪枝和新型权重重新初始化技术（如CLAP和SLNP），并针对Ascend NPU优化。

Result: Pangu Light模型在精度和效率上优于基准方法（如Nemotron和Qwen3系列），例如Pangu Light-32B在Ascend NPU上表现更优。

Conclusion: Pangu Light通过系统化的剪枝和重新初始化策略，为LLMs的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art capabilities across
numerous tasks, but their immense size and inference costs pose significant
computational challenges for practical deployment. While structured pruning
offers a promising avenue for model compression, existing methods often
struggle with the detrimental effects of aggressive, simultaneous width and
depth reductions, leading to substantial performance degradation. This paper
argues that a critical, often overlooked, aspect in making such aggressive
joint pruning viable is the strategic re-initialization and adjustment of
remaining weights to improve the model post-pruning training accuracies. We
introduce Pangu Light, a framework for LLM acceleration centered around
structured pruning coupled with novel weight re-initialization techniques
designed to address this ``missing piece''. Our framework systematically
targets multiple axes, including model width, depth, attention heads, and
RMSNorm, with its effectiveness rooted in novel re-initialization methods like
Cross-Layer Attention Pruning (CLAP) and Stabilized LayerNorm Pruning (SLNP)
that mitigate performance drops by providing the network a better training
starting point. Further enhancing efficiency, Pangu Light incorporates
specialized optimizations such as absorbing Post-RMSNorm computations and
tailors its strategies to Ascend NPU characteristics. The Pangu Light models
consistently exhibit a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, outperforming
prominent baseline pruning methods like Nemotron and established LLMs like
Qwen3 series. For instance, on Ascend NPUs, Pangu Light-32B's 81.6 average
score and 2585 tokens/s throughput exceed Qwen3-32B's 80.9 average score and
2225 tokens/s.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) engines, accurately transcribing dysarthric speech remains a major
challenge. In this work, we proposed a two-stage framework for the Speech
Accessibility Project Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2025, which combines
cutting-edge speech recognition models with LLM-based generative error
correction (GER). We assess different configurations of model scales and
training strategies, incorporating specific hypothesis selection to improve
transcription accuracy. Experiments on the Speech Accessibility Project dataset
demonstrate the strength of our approach on structured and spontaneous speech,
while highlighting challenges in single-word recognition. Through comprehensive
analysis, we provide insights into the complementary roles of acoustic and
linguistic modeling in dysarthric speech recognition

*Dairu Liu,Ziyue Wang,Minyuan Ruan,Fuwen Luo,Chi Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出视觉抽象思维（VAT），通过简化视觉信息提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，实验显示性能提升17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像信息冗余可能降低多模态推理性能，人类抽象思维启发提出视觉抽象方法。

Method: 引入VAT范式，用视觉抽象替代冗长的中间步骤或外部知识，简化推理过程。

Result: VAT在多种模型上表现优异，平均性能提升17%，兼容知识密集型任务。

Conclusion: VAT验证了视觉抽象思维的有效性，为多模态推理提供新思路。

Abstract: Images usually convey richer detail than text, but often include redundant
information which potentially downgrades multimodal reasoning performance. When
faced with lengthy or complex messages, humans tend to employ abstract thinking
to convert them into simple and concise abstracts. Inspired by this cognitive
strategy, we introduce Visual Abstract Thinking (VAT), a novel thinking
paradigm that prompts Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with visual
abstract instead of explicit verbal thoughts or elaborate guidance, permitting
a more concentrated visual reasoning mechanism. Explicit thinking, such as
Chain-of-thought (CoT) or tool-augmented approaches, increases the complexity
of reasoning process via inserting verbose intermediate steps, external
knowledge or visual information. In contrast, VAT reduces redundant visual
information and encourages models to focus their reasoning on more essential
visual elements. Experimental results show that VAT consistently empowers
different models, and achieves an average gain of 17% over GPT-4o baseline by
employing diverse types of visual abstracts, demonstrating that VAT can enhance
visual reasoning abilities for MLLMs regarding conceptual, structural and
relational reasoning tasks. VAT is also compatible with CoT in
knowledge-intensive multimodal reasoning tasks. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of visual reasoning via abstract thinking and encourage further
exploration of more diverse reasoning paradigms from the perspective of human
cognition.

Result: KAN层可有效替代线性层，多数情况下性能相当或更优，并揭示了KAN与线性层对输入波形区域的不同关注方式。

Conclusion: KANs在语音理解任务中具有潜力，可作为线性层的替代方案，性能表现优越。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional neural architectures, yet their application to
speech processing remains under explored. This work presents the first
investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We
experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five
different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup,
which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to
transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing
complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear
layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we
provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers
differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型的高阶思维能力是挑战，现有方法多关注表面准确性，缺乏系统性。

Method: 提出THiNK框架，通过问题生成、批判和修订的迭代任务，结合反馈循环评估LLM的高低阶思维技能。

Result: 模型在低阶任务表现稳定，但在高阶任务中应用知识和抽象能力有限；反馈循环显著提升推理表现。

Conclusion: THiNK为LLM推理评估提供了可扩展方法，结合学习科学为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Assessing higher-order thinking skills in large language models (LLMs)
remains a fundamental challenge, especially in tasks that go beyond
surface-level accuracy. In this work, we propose THiNK (Testing Higher-order
Notion of Knowledge), a multi-agent, feedback-driven evaluation framework
grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. THiNK frames reasoning assessment as an iterative
task of problem generation, critique, and revision, encouraging LLMs to
think-aloud through step-by-step reflection and refinement. This enables a
systematic evaluation of both lower-order (e.g., remember, understand) and
higher-order (e.g., evaluate, create) thinking skills. We apply THiNK to seven
state-of-the-art LLMs and perform a detailed cognitive analysis of their
outputs. Results reveal that while models reliably perform lower-order
categories well, they struggle with applying knowledge in realistic contexts
and exhibit limited abstraction. Structured feedback loops significantly
improve reasoning performance, particularly in higher-order thinking.
Qualitative evaluations further confirm that THiNK-guided outputs better align
with domain logic and problem structure. The code of our framework provides a
scalable methodology for probing and enhancing LLM reasoning, offering new
directions for evaluation grounded in learning science, which is available at
our GitHub repository.

Motivation: 长文本生成质量评估存在性能随输入长度增加而下降的问题，现有方法难以有效解决。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，将评估任务分解为局部评分和全局评估，结合混合上下文学习和主动学习算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于多个基线方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了长文本生成质量的评估效果，同时降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of long-form, model-generated text is challenging, even
with advanced LLM-as-a-Judge methods, due to performance degradation as input
length increases. To address this issue, we propose a divide-and-conquer
approach, which breaks down the comprehensive evaluation task into a series of
localized scoring tasks, followed by a final global assessment. This strategy
allows for more granular and manageable evaluations, ensuring that each segment
of the text is assessed in isolation for both coherence and quality, while also
accounting for the overall structure and consistency of the entire piece.
Moreover, we introduce a hybrid in-context learning approach that leverages
human annotations to enhance the performance of both local and global
evaluations. By incorporating human-generated feedback directly into the
evaluation process, this method allows the model to better align with human
judgment. Finally, we develop an uncertainty-based active learning algorithm
that efficiently selects data samples for human annotation, thereby reducing
annotation costs in practical scenarios. Experimental results show that the
proposed evaluation framework outperforms several representative baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应分类器自由引导（A-CFG）方法，通过动态调整无条件输入，优化生成模型中的不确定性处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG使用静态无条件输入，无法适应迭代生成过程中模型不确定性的动态变化，导致效果不佳。

Method: A-CFG根据模型的瞬时预测置信度动态调整无条件输入，对低置信度标记重新掩码，实现局部化引导。

Result: 实验表明，A-CFG在多种语言生成任务中显著优于标准CFG，例如在GPQA上提升了3.9分。

Conclusion: 动态调整引导机制以适应模型不确定性，能有效提升迭代生成的效果。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in
generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions.
However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be
suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies
dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel
method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's
instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked)
diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated
sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are
temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This
focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to
more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked
diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse
language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements
over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work
highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model
uncertainty in iterative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心理健康服务资源有限，人们转向大型语言模型（LLMs）寻求帮助，但LLMs在多轮心理健康对话中的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入MedAgent框架生成合成数据，创建MHSD数据集（2200+对话），并提出MultiSenseEval评估框架。

Result: 前沿模型在患者中心沟通和诊断能力上表现较差（平均31%），且性能随对话轮次增加而下降。

Conclusion: 研究提供了数据生成框架、数据集和评估方法，为LLMs在心理健康对话中的能力评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Limited access to mental healthcare, extended wait times, and increasing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led individuals to turn to
LLMs for fulfilling their mental health needs. However, examining the
multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains
under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic
accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific
goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To
address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically
generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and
use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset,
comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present
MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation
abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our
findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for
patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities
with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model
performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing
turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data
generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in
multi-turn mental health conversations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过数据为中心的方法提升闭源大语言模型（LLMs）的鲁棒性，无需访问模型内部。针对不同复杂度的OOD数据，提出了不同的优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭源LLMs在微调时容易学习数据集特定的启发式方法，导致在OOD数据上鲁棒性下降。现有方法要么效果不佳，要么不适用于闭源模型。

Method: 采用数据为中心的方法，针对不同复杂度的OOD数据：对高复杂度数据上采样挑战性训练样本；对低复杂度数据用LLM生成样本替换部分训练集。

Result: 高复杂度OOD数据上鲁棒性提升1.5%，低复杂度数据上提升3.7%。闭源自回归LLMs比常用编码器模型更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 闭源自回归LLMs是更合适的基线选择，数据为中心的方法能有效提升其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular,
with impressive performance across a wide range of natural language tasks.
These models can be fine-tuned to further improve performance, but this often
results in the models learning from dataset-specific heuristics that reduce
their robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methods to improve
robustness either perform poorly, or are non-applicable to closed-source models
because they assume access to model internals, or the ability to change the
model's training procedure. In this work, we investigate strategies to improve
the robustness of closed-source LLMs through data-centric methods that do not
require access to model internals. We find that the optimal strategy depends on
the complexity of the OOD data. For highly complex OOD datasets, upsampling
more challenging training examples can improve robustness by up to 1.5%. For
less complex OOD datasets, replacing a portion of the training set with
LLM-generated examples can improve robustness by 3.7%. More broadly, we find
that large-scale closed-source autoregressive LLMs are substantially more
robust than commonly used encoder models, and are a more appropriate choice of
baseline going forward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双仿射评分在依赖解析中未进行归一化，导致模型过参数化，效率低下。

Result: 归一化后，模型在部分数据集上达到最优性能，且参数和样本需求减少。

Conclusion: 归一化双仿射评分能显著提升依赖解析效率，减少过参数化。

Abstract: Dependency parsing is the task of inferring natural language structure, often
approached by modeling word interactions via attention through biaffine
scoring. This mechanism works like self-attention in Transformers, where scores
are calculated for every pair of words in a sentence. However, unlike
Transformer attention, biaffine scoring does not use normalization prior to
taking the softmax of the scores. In this paper, we provide theoretical
evidence and empirical results revealing that a lack of normalization
necessarily results in overparameterized parser models, where the extra
parameters compensate for the sharp softmax outputs produced by high variance
inputs to the biaffine scoring function. We argue that biaffine scoring can be
made substantially more efficient by performing score normalization. We conduct
experiments on six datasets for semantic and syntactic dependency parsing using
a one-hop parser. We train N-layer stacked BiLSTMs and evaluate the parser's
performance with and without normalizing biaffine scores. Normalizing allows us
to beat the state of the art on two datasets, with fewer samples and trainable
parameters. Code: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EfficientSDP-70C1

Motivation: 学术研究者缺乏开放的MoE平台，无法深入研究扩展、路由和专家行为。

Method: 发布FLAME-MoE，包含7个模型（38M至1.7B参数），采用64专家和top-8门控架构。

Result: 在6个评估任务中，FLAME-MoE比密集基线模型平均准确率提升3.4点。

Conclusion: FLAME-MoE为MoE研究提供透明、可复现的平台，并揭示了专家行为规律。

Abstract: Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4
increasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong
efficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model
per token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE
platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release
FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven
decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose
architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely
reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs,
and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation.
Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4
points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full
training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i)
experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation
matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing
behavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.

Motivation: 现有任务导向对话系统主要关注单会话对话，限制了其在长期记忆增强中的有效性。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）记忆引导对话规划，检索意图对齐的历史，通过记忆判断器识别关键问答单元，去除冗余问题并基于重构记忆生成响应；2）主动响应策略，检测并纠正错误或遗漏。

Result: 在MS-TOD数据集上，MAP显著提高了多会话场景中的任务成功率和轮次效率，同时在单会话任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MS-TOD数据集和MAP方法为多会话任务导向对话提供了新的基准和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems primarily focus on
single-session dialogues, limiting their effectiveness in long-term memory
augmentation. To address this challenge, we introduce a MS-TOD dataset, the
first multi-session TOD dataset designed to retain long-term memory across
sessions, enabling fewer turns and more efficient task completion. This defines
a new benchmark task for evaluating long-term memory in multi-session TOD.
Based on this new dataset, we propose a Memory-Active Policy (MAP) that
improves multi-session dialogue efficiency through a two-stage approach. 1)
Memory-Guided Dialogue Planning retrieves intent-aligned history, identifies
key QA units via a memory judger, refines them by removing redundant questions,
and generates responses based on the reconstructed memory. 2) Proactive
Response Strategy detects and correct errors or omissions, ensuring efficient
and accurate task completion. We evaluate MAP on MS-TOD dataset, focusing on
response quality and effectiveness of the proactive strategy. Experiments on
MS-TOD demonstrate that MAP significantly improves task success and turn
efficiency in multi-session scenarios, while maintaining competitive
performance on conventional single-session tasks.

Abstract: Time plays a critical role in how information is generated, retrieved, and
interpreted. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of Temporal
Information Retrieval and Temporal Question Answering, two research areas aimed
at handling and understanding time-sensitive information. As the amount of
time-stamped content from sources like news articles, web archives, and

temporal intent, normalizing time expressions, ordering events, and reasoning
over evolving or ambiguous facts. These challenges are critical across many
dynamic and time-sensitive domains, from news and encyclopedias to science,
history, and social media. We review both traditional approaches and modern
neural methods, including those that use transformer models and Large Language

multi-hop reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), alongside
benchmark datasets and evaluation strategies that test temporal robustness,

Conclusion: KnowTrace有效解决上下文过载问题，并通过结构化知识图谱和自举机制提升推理质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large
language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to
handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between
LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's
context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing
burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces,
with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this
paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the
context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead
of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out
desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to
the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with
an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective
mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as
process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show
that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop
question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies
the gains.

Abstract: Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather
impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable.
However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of
high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The
climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities
adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original
corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather
impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we
propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs
on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks,
multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive
experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the
challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate
change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the
evaluation framework are available to help society protect against

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但无法根据任务难度调整推理token使用，导致“过度思考”问题。

Method: 提出ARM模型，支持四种推理格式（Direct Answer、Short CoT、Code、Long CoT），并引入Ada-GRPO训练方法解决格式崩溃问题。

Result: ARM平均减少30% token使用（最高70%），性能与Long CoT相当，训练速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应推理格式显著提升效率，同时支持指令引导和共识引导模式，满足不同需求。

Abstract: While large reasoning models demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks,
they lack the ability to adjust reasoning token usage based on task difficulty.
This often leads to the "overthinking" problem -- excessive and unnecessary
reasoning -- which, although potentially mitigated by human intervention to
control the token budget, still fundamentally contradicts the goal of achieving
fully autonomous AI. In this work, we propose Adaptive Reasoning Model (ARM), a
reasoning model capable of adaptively selecting appropriate reasoning formats
based on the task at hand. These formats include three efficient ones -- Direct
Answer, Short CoT, and Code -- as well as a more elaborate format, Long CoT. To
train ARM, we introduce Ada-GRPO, an adaptation of Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), which addresses the format collapse issue in traditional
GRPO. Ada-GRPO enables ARM to achieve high token efficiency, reducing tokens by
an average of 30%, and up to 70%, while maintaining performance comparable to
the model that relies solely on Long CoT. Furthermore, not only does it improve
inference efficiency through reduced token generation, but it also brings a 2x
speedup in training. In addition to the default Adaptive Mode, ARM supports two
additional reasoning modes: 1) Instruction-Guided Mode, which allows users to
explicitly specify the reasoning format via special tokens -- ideal when the
appropriate format is known for a batch of tasks. 2) Consensus-Guided Mode,
which aggregates the outputs of the three efficient formats and resorts to Long
CoT in case of disagreement, prioritizing performance with higher token usage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统评估了量化方法对长输入和长输出任务中大型语言模型的影响，发现8位量化性能损失小，而4位量化性能下降显著，且受模型、任务和语言影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的长上下文窗口带来高内存和延迟问题，量化虽能缓解但可能影响性能，需系统评估其效果。

Method: 评估了五种量化方法和五个模型在9.7K测试样本上的表现，涵盖长输入和长输出任务。

Result: 8位量化平均性能损失小（约0.8%），4位量化性能下降显著（最高59%），且非英语输入表现更差。

Conclusion: 量化效果因方法、模型和任务而异，部署前需针对具体任务和语言谨慎评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows exceeding 128K
tokens, but this comes with significant memory requirements and high inference
latency. Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In
this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on
tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation
spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4,
GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B,
and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy
(~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for
tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation
tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially,
the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model,
and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4,
Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These
findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before
deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with
languages other than English.

TL;DR: OmniCharacter是一种新型的语音-语言交互模型，旨在提升角色扮演代理（RPAs）的沉浸感，通过结合角色特定的语音和语言特征，实现低延迟的交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本对话，忽略了语音特征在交互中的关键作用，影响了沉浸感。

Method: 提出OmniCharacter模型，结合角色特定的人格和语音特征，构建了OmniCharacter-10K数据集，包含多样化的角色和动态语音响应。

Result: 实验表明，OmniCharacter在内容和风格上优于现有RPAs和主流语音-语言模型，响应延迟低至289ms。

Conclusion: OmniCharacter为沉浸式角色扮演代理提供了有效的解决方案，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Role-Playing Agents (RPAs), benefiting from large language models, is an
emerging interactive AI system that simulates roles or characters with diverse
personalities. However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues
among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice
style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to
be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we
propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction
model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter
enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and
vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and
language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we
construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive
characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic
speech response (135K). Experimental results showcase that our method yields
better responses in terms of both content and style compared to existing RPAs
and mainstream speech-language models, with a response latency as low as 289ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的方法受限于任务特定数据的固有特性，限制了代理的通用搜索能力，因此需要一种新方法来增强代理的通用检索能力。

Method: 提出MASKSEARCH框架，包括RAMP预训练任务，结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）进行训练，采用多代理系统和混合奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，MASKSEARCH显著提升了基于LLM的搜索代理在领域内和领域外下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MASKSEARCH通过预训练和下游任务优化，有效增强了LLM的通用检索和推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) represent a classic paradigm
where models enhance generative capabilities using external knowledge retrieved
via a specialized module. Recent advancements in Agent techniques enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously utilize tools for retrieval, planning,
and reasoning. While existing training-based methods show promise, their
agentic abilities are limited by inherent characteristics of the task-specific
data used during training. To further enhance the universal search capability
of agents, we propose a novel pre-training framework, MASKSEARCH. In the
pre-training stage, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Mask Prediction (RAMP)
task, where the model learns to leverage search tools to fill masked spans on a
large number of pre-training data, thus acquiring universal retrieval and
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. After that, the model is trained on downstream
tasks to achieve further improvement. We apply both Supervised Fine-tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for training. For SFT, we combine
agent-based and distillation-based methods to generate training data, starting
with a multi-agent system consisting of a planner, rewriter, observer, and
followed by a self-evolving teacher model. While for RL, we employ DAPO as the
training framework and adopt a hybrid reward system consisting of answer
rewards and format rewards. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum learning
approach that allows the model to learn progressively from easier to more
challenging instances based on the number of masked spans. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our framework in the scenario of open-domain multi-hop
question answering. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
MASKSEARCH significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based search agents on
both in-domain and out-of-domain downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的可解释方法在文本领域应用有限，依赖预定义概念或生成难以理解的解释，影响了用户信任。

Method: ECO-Concept采用对象中心架构自动提取概念，通过大语言模型评估概念可理解性，并指导模型微调。

Result: 实验表明，ECO-Concept在多样任务中表现优异，且其学习的概念在可理解性上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ECO-Concept为自动发现可理解概念提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型解释的直观性。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable approaches have emerged as a promising method in
explainable AI because they can interpret models in a way that aligns with
human reasoning. However, their adaption in the text domain remains limited.
Most existing methods rely on predefined concept annotations and cannot
discover unseen concepts, while other methods that extract concepts without
supervision often produce explanations that are not intuitively comprehensible
to humans, potentially diminishing user trust. These methods fall short of
discovering comprehensible concepts automatically. To address this issue, we
propose \textbf{ECO-Concept}, an intrinsically interpretable framework to
discover comprehensible concepts with no concept annotations. ECO-Concept first
utilizes an object-centric architecture to extract semantic concepts
automatically. Then the comprehensibility of the extracted concepts is
evaluated by large language models. Finally, the evaluation result guides the
subsequent model fine-tuning to obtain more understandable explanations.
Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across diverse
tasks. Further concept evaluations validate that the concepts learned by
ECO-Concept surpassed current counterparts in comprehensibility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法SelfReflect，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）输出字符串对其内部答案分布的总结能力，并证明其优于其他指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法仅提供百分比数字，无法充分表达LLM的内部不确定性，因此需要更直观的字符串总结方法。

Method: 提出SelfReflect指标，通过采样和总结生成字符串，评估其对LLM内部答案分布的忠实度。

Result: SelfReflect能区分细微差异并与人类判断一致，优于LLM法官和嵌入比较等方法。

Conclusion: SelfReflect为LLM不确定性提供了一种新形式，未来可进一步探索其通用性。

Abstract: To reveal when a large language model (LLM) is uncertain about a response,
uncertainty quantification commonly produces percentage numbers along with the
output. But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs,
the space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the
distribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation
for this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a
theoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an
LLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to
discriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it
aligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM
judges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of
self-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models
struggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful
summarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables
future works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理大语言模型在测试时计算（TTC）技术中表现出色，但缺乏系统性解决问题的能力，导致在复杂任务中性能下降。

Method: 通过定性和定量分析多款先进大语言模型，识别其系统性推理的失败模式，如无效推理步骤和冗余探索。

Result: 研究发现模型在简单任务中表现良好，但随着复杂度增加，性能急剧下降，且存在不忠实结论等问题。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发新指标和工具，以评估推理过程的结构而非仅关注最终输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
through test-time computation (TTC) techniques such as chain-of-thought
prompting and tree-based reasoning. However, we argue that current reasoning
LLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space.
This paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and
identifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers
rather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid
reasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful
conclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance
can appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity
increases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that
evaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process
itself.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和模型为漫画领域的大型多模态模型评估和发展提供了基础。

Abstract: Manga, or Japanese comics, is a richly multimodal narrative form that blends
images and text in complex ways. Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to
understand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators
reflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks
for multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text
recognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual
understanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526
high-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable
evaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these
benchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the
open-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive
experiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model
provide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the
richly narrative domain of manga.

Abstract: Large multimodal foundation models, particularly in the domains of language
and vision, have significantly advanced various tasks, including robotics,
autonomous driving, information retrieval, and grounding. However, many of
these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that
constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated
affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is
fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a
novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part
segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the
performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks
within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that
task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for
state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark,
we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement
through fine-tuning with our dataset. With our dataset and benchmark, we aim to
facilitate research on task-oriented part segmentation and enhance the
applicability of VLMs across various domains, including robotics, virtual
reality, information retrieval, and other related fields. Project website:

Motivation: 提高训练效率，减少手动标注样本的需求。

Method: 采用均匀采样和帧差采样两种策略，分别针对状态空间均匀性和视频帧间冗余性。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略能提供高质量训练数据集，且所需手动标注样本较少。

Conclusion: 提出的采样策略有效提升了训练效率，减少了标注成本。

Abstract: Two sampling strategies are investigated to enhance efficiency in training a
deep learning object detection model. These sampling strategies are employed
under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of deep learning models. The first
strategy is uniform sampling which seeks to obtain samples evenly yet randomly
through the state space of the object dynamics. The second strategy of frame
difference sampling is developed to explore the temporal redundancy among
successive frames in a video. Experiment result indicates that these proposed
sampling strategies provide a dataset that yields good training performance
while requiring relatively few manually labelled samples.

Conclusion: 该方法通过层次分解和残差学习显著提升了动态场景的渲染质量，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting methods have emerged as a desirable substitute
for prior Radiance Field methods for novel-view synthesis of scenes captured
with multi-view images or videos. In this work, we propose a novel extension to
4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. Drawing on ideas from residual
learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a
"video-segment-frame" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical
flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model
the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and
frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This
approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several
established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with
large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade
most.

Result: 在OCTMNIST数据集上，CoLoRA微调的CNN准确率提升近1%，性能与Vision Transformer等模型相当。

Conclusion: CoLoRA是一种高效、稳定的微调方法，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) method, designed
explicitly to overcome the inefficiencies found in current CNN fine-tuning
methods. CoLoRA can be seen as a natural extension of the convolutional
architectures of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our method by developing and evaluating models using the widely
adopted CNN backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. We observed that this strategy
results in a stable and accurate coarse-tuning procedure. Moreover, this
strategy is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the number of
parameters required for fine-tuning compared to traditional methods.
Furthermore, our method substantially improves the speed and stability of
training. Our case study focuses on classifying retinal diseases from optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images, specifically using the OCTMNIST dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that a CNN backbone fine-tuned with CoLoRA
surpasses nearly 1\% in accuracy. Such a performance is comparable to the
Vision Transformer, State-space discrete, and Kolmogorov-Arnold network models.

Method: 利用距离目标优化，无需源数据或架构修改，适用于黑盒和混合设置。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: DART$^3$是减轻相机偏差的有效在线学习方案。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) models are known to suffer from camera bias,
where learned representations cluster according to camera viewpoints rather
than identity, leading to significant performance degradation under
(inter-camera) domain shifts in real-world surveillance systems when new
cameras are added to camera networks. State-of-the-art test-time adaptation
(TTA) methods, largely designed for classification tasks, rely on
classification entropy-based objectives that fail to generalize well to ReID,
thus making them unsuitable for tackling camera bias. In this paper, we
introduce DART$^3$, a TTA framework specifically designed to mitigate
camera-induced domain shifts in person ReID. DART$^3$ (Distance-Aware Retrieval
Tuning at Test Time) leverages a distance-based objective that aligns better
with image retrieval tasks like ReID by exploiting the correlation between
nearest-neighbor distance and prediction error. Unlike prior ReID-specific
domain adaptation methods, DART$^3$ requires no source data, architectural
modifications, or retraining, and can be deployed in both fully black-box and
hybrid settings. Empirical evaluations on multiple ReID benchmarks indicate
that DART$^3$ and DART$^3$ LITE, a lightweight alternative to the approach,
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TTA baselines, making for a viable
option to online learning to mitigate the adverse effects of camera bias.

Motivation: 当前3D姿态估计技术存在细节不足、标注耗时和优化成本高的问题，限制了细微动作研究和大规模分析。

Method: 提出Pose Splatter框架，结合形状雕刻和3D高斯溅射，并引入旋转不变视觉嵌入技术。

Result: 实验表明，Pose Splatter能准确学习3D动物几何，捕捉细微姿态变化，并在低维嵌入上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Pose Splatter消除了标注和逐帧优化的瓶颈，为大规模行为分析提供了高分辨率工具。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial
for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint-
and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited
representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive
per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements
and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a
novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the
complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of
animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose
a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and
appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in
downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and
zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably,
Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better
low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans,
and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame
optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale,
longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and
micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.

Conclusion: CONCORD方法显著提升了数据集蒸馏的可控性和可解释性，且不依赖预训练分类器。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) has witnessed significant progress in creating
small datasets that encapsulate rich information from large original ones.
Particularly, methods based on generative priors show promising performance,
while maintaining computational efficiency and cross-architecture
generalization. However, the generation process lacks explicit controllability
for each sample. Previous distillation methods primarily match the real
distribution from the perspective of the entire dataset, whereas overlooking
concept completeness at the instance level. The missing or incorrectly
represented object details cannot be efficiently compensated due to the
constrained sample amount typical in DD settings. To this end, we propose
incorporating the concept understanding of large language models (LLMs) to
perform Concept-Informed Diffusion (CONCORD) for dataset distillation.
Specifically, distinguishable and fine-grained concepts are retrieved based on
category labels to inform the denoising process and refine essential object
details. By integrating these concepts, the proposed method significantly

### [262] [Weakly-supervised Mamba-Based Mastoidectomy Shape Prediction for Cochlear Implant Surgery Using 3D T-Distribution Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18368)
*Yike Zhang,Jack H. Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于弱监督Mamba框架的新方法，用于从术前CT扫描中预测准确的乳突切除术区域，解决了先前方法的鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳突切除术是人工耳蜗植入手术中的关键步骤，准确预测其区域有助于术前规划、降低手术风险并改善手术效果。先前的方法鲁棒性不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用弱监督Mamba框架，结合3D T分布损失函数处理乳突切除术形状的几何变异性，利用先前自监督网络的标注结果进行训练。

Result: 新方法在预测乳突切除术区域上表现优于现有技术，具有更高的准确性和临床相关性。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督学习框架和3D T分布损失函数显著提升了预测的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Cochlear implant surgery is a treatment for individuals with severe hearing
loss. It involves inserting an array of electrodes inside the cochlea to
electrically stimulate the auditory nerve and restore hearing sensation. A
crucial step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, a surgical intervention that
removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone, providing a critical
pathway to the cochlea for electrode placement. Accurate prediction of the
mastoidectomy region from preoperative imaging assists presurgical planning,
reduces surgical risks, and improves surgical outcomes. In previous work, a
self-supervised network was introduced to predict the mastoidectomy region
using only preoperative CT scans. While promising, the method suffered from
suboptimal robustness, limiting its practical application. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel weakly-supervised Mamba-based framework to
predict accurate mastoidectomy regions directly from preoperative CT scans. Our
approach utilizes a 3D T-Distribution loss function inspired by the Student-t
distribution, which effectively handles the complex geometric variability
inherent in mastoidectomy shapes. Weak supervision is achieved using the
segmentation results from the prior self-supervised network to eliminate the
need for manual data cleaning or labeling throughout the training process. The
proposed method is extensively evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in predicting accurate and clinically
relevant mastoidectomy regions. Our findings highlight the robustness and
efficiency of the weakly-supervised learning framework with the proposed novel
3D T-Distribution loss.

*Yike Zhang,Eduardo Davalos Anaya,Jack H. Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需外部硬件或标记的单目患者到图像术中配准新方法，通过轻量级神经网络实现实时耳蜗植入手术引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖外部跟踪系统或标记，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 利用合成显微镜手术场景数据集，通过零样本学习方法将术前CT扫描映射到2D术中图像。

Result: 在9个临床案例中验证，角度误差大多在10度以内，达到临床相关精度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外硬件，适用于单目手术显微镜，具有临床实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for monocular patient-to-image
intraoperative registration, specifically designed to operate without any
external hardware tracking equipment or fiducial point markers. Leveraging a
synthetic microscopy surgical scene dataset with a wide range of
transformations, our approach directly maps preoperative CT scans to 2D
intraoperative surgical frames through a lightweight neural network for
real-time cochlear implant surgery guidance via a zero-shot learning approach.
Unlike traditional methods, our framework seamlessly integrates with monocular
surgical microscopes, making it highly practical for clinical use without
additional hardware dependencies and requirements. Our method estimates camera
poses, which include a rotation matrix and a translation vector, by learning
from the synthetic dataset, enabling accurate and efficient intraoperative
registration. The proposed framework was evaluated on nine clinical cases using
a patient-specific and cross-patient validation strategy. Our results suggest
that our approach achieves clinically relevant accuracy in predicting 6D camera
poses for registering 3D preoperative CT scans to 2D surgical scenes with an
angular error within 10 degrees in most cases, while also addressing
limitations of traditional methods, such as reliance on external tracking
systems or fiducial markers.

Conclusion: D^3HR是一种高效且高代表性的数据集蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for
dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while
maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of
diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled
images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current
diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution
matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling.
Building on this, we propose D^3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to
generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we
adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a
low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving
information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative
latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient
sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the
high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that D^3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures
compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation. Source code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）为康复患者提供运动质量评估和反馈的新方法，通过骨骼关节特征提取和多种提示技术实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统康复项目因交通限制和人员短缺导致高退出率，虚拟平台结合AI技术可提升康复效果，但目前缺乏基于文本反馈的康复数据集和LLMs的应用研究。

Method: 从患者骨骼关节提取运动特征，输入预训练LLMs，采用零样本、少样本、思维链和角色扮演等提示技术生成自然语言反馈。

Result: 在UI-PRMD和REHAB24-6数据集上验证，方法在运动评估、推理和反馈生成方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法可整合到虚拟康复平台，帮助患者正确运动，支持康复并改善健康结果。

Abstract: Exercise-based rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces morbidity,
mortality, and rehospitalization, though transportation constraints and staff
shortages lead to high dropout rates from rehabilitation programs. Virtual
platforms enable patients to complete prescribed exercises at home, while AI
algorithms analyze performance, deliver feedback, and update clinicians.
Although many studies have developed machine learning and deep learning models
for exercise quality assessment, few have explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for feedback and are limited by the lack of rehabilitation
datasets containing textual feedback. In this paper, we propose a new method in
which exercise-specific features are extracted from the skeletal joints of
patients performing rehabilitation exercises and fed into pre-trained LLMs.
Using a range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, and role-play prompting, LLMs are leveraged to evaluate
exercise quality and provide feedback in natural language to help patients
improve their movements. The method was evaluated through extensive experiments
on two publicly available rehabilitation exercise assessment datasets (UI-PRMD
and REHAB24-6) and showed promising results in exercise assessment, reasoning,
and feedback generation. This approach can be integrated into virtual
rehabilitation platforms to help patients perform exercises correctly, support
recovery, and improve health outcomes.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了认知健康老年人和认知障碍者在自动驾驶车辆接管请求（TORs）中的情感反应，发现认知障碍者情感反应较弱，需适应性车辆系统支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知衰退可能影响驾驶安全，了解情感反应有助于评估驾驶者接管能力，尤其是认知脆弱人群。

Method: 通过面部表情分析测量效价和唤醒度，比较不同道路几何和速度下的组内和组间差异。

Result: 认知健康者在高需求条件下唤醒度增加，认知障碍者唤醒度降低且效价更高。

Conclusion: 认知障碍者情感反应减弱，需开发能检测情感状态并支持安全接管的车辆系统。

Abstract: Driving is a key component of independence and quality of life for older
adults. However, cognitive decline associated with conditions such as mild
cognitive impairment and dementia can compromise driving safety and often lead
to premature driving cessation. Conditionally automated vehicles, which require
drivers to take over control when automation reaches its operational limits,
offer a potential assistive solution. However, their effectiveness depends on
the driver's ability to respond to takeover requests (TORs) in a timely and
appropriate manner. Understanding emotional responses during TORs can provide
insight into drivers' engagement, stress levels, and readiness to resume
control, particularly in cognitively vulnerable populations. This study
investigated affective responses, measured via facial expression analysis of
valence and arousal, during TORs among cognitively healthy older adults and
those with cognitive impairment. Facial affect data were analyzed across
different road geometries and speeds to evaluate within- and between-group
differences in affective states. Within-group comparisons using the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test revealed significant changes in valence and arousal during
TORs for both groups. Cognitively healthy individuals showed adaptive increases
in arousal under higher-demand conditions, while those with cognitive
impairment exhibited reduced arousal and more positive valence in several
scenarios. Between-group comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test indicated
that cognitively impaired individuals displayed lower arousal and higher
valence than controls across different TOR conditions. These findings suggest
reduced emotional response and awareness in cognitively impaired drivers,
highlighting the need for adaptive vehicle systems that detect affective states
and support safe handovers for vulnerable users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中难以准确表示边界、处理器官形态多样性及避免下采样信息丢失，限制了准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: CENet框架包含Dual Selective Enhancement Block（DSEB）增强边界细节和Context Feature Attention Module（CFAM）保持空间完整性。

Result: 在放射学和皮肤镜数据集上的评估显示，CENet在多器官分割和边界细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CENet为复杂医学图像分析任务提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation, particularly in multi-domain scenarios, requires
precise preservation of anatomical structures across diverse representations.
While deep learning has advanced this field, existing models often struggle
with accurate boundary representation, variability in organ morphology, and
information loss during downsampling, limiting their accuracy and robustness.
To address these challenges, we propose the Context Enhancement Network
(CENet), a novel segmentation framework featuring two key innovations. First,
the Dual Selective Enhancement Block (DSEB) integrated into skip connections
enhances boundary details and improves the detection of smaller organs in a
context-aware manner. Second, the Context Feature Attention Module (CFAM) in
the decoder employs a multi-scale design to maintain spatial integrity, reduce
feature redundancy, and mitigate overly enhanced representations. Extensive
evaluations on both radiology and dermoscopic datasets demonstrate that CENet
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in multi-organ segmentation and
boundary detail preservation, offering a robust and accurate solution for
complex medical image analysis tasks. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/xmindflow/cenet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的训练时否定数据生成方法TNG-CLIP，并首次提出了用于评估文本到图像生成模型在否定提示下表现的基准Neg-TtoI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在否定理解上表现有限，现有方法需要大量时间和计算资源，且评估范围受限。

Method: 通过训练时生成否定数据（仅增加2.5%训练时间），并建立Neg-TtoI基准评估模型在否定提示下的表现。

Result: TNG-CLIP在图像-文本匹配、文本-图像检索和图像生成等任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TNG-CLIP高效且性能优越，为否定理解提供了新的解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong
performance across a range of downstream tasks. However, CLIP is still limited
in negation understanding: the ability to recognize the absence or exclusion of
a concept. Existing methods address the problem by using a large language model
(LLM) to generate large-scale data of image captions containing negation for
further fine-tuning CLIP. However, these methods are both time- and
compute-intensive, and their evaluations are typically restricted to image-text
matching tasks. To expand the horizon, we (1) introduce a training-time
negation data generation pipeline such that negation captions are generated
during the training stage, which only increases 2.5% extra training time, and
(2) we propose the first benchmark, Neg-TtoI, for evaluating text-to-image
generation models on prompts containing negation, assessing model's ability to
produce semantically accurate images. We show that our proposed method,
TNG-CLIP, achieves SOTA performance on diverse negation benchmarks of
image-to-text matching, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation.

Method: 提出OmniConsistency，包括上下文一致性学习框架、两阶段渐进学习策略和即插即用设计。

Result: 实验表明，OmniConsistency显著提升了视觉一致性和美学质量，性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: OmniConsistency有效解决了风格化中的一致性和风格退化问题，填补了开源与专有模型的差距。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced image stylization significantly, yet two core
challenges persist: (1) maintaining consistent stylization in complex scenes,
particularly identity, composition, and fine details, and (2) preventing style
degradation in image-to-image pipelines with style LoRAs. GPT-4o's exceptional
stylization consistency highlights the performance gap between open-source
methods and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{OmniConsistency}, a universal consistency plugin leveraging large-scale
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). OmniConsistency contributes: (1) an in-context
consistency learning framework trained on aligned image pairs for robust
generalization; (2) a two-stage progressive learning strategy decoupling style
learning from consistency preservation to mitigate style degradation; and (3) a
fully plug-and-play design compatible with arbitrary style LoRAs under the Flux
framework. Extensive experiments show that OmniConsistency significantly
enhances visual coherence and aesthetic quality, achieving performance
comparable to commercial state-of-the-art model GPT-4o.

Motivation: 上下文偏差在目标检测训练中普遍存在，但缺乏对其成因和消除方法的系统性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Mask Pooling方法，利用前景掩码分离前景和背景的池化过程，并通过新设计的基准测试验证模型在不同域中的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Mask Pooling能够有效减少上下文偏差，使模型在不同域中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 本文为减少域适应目标检测中的上下文偏差提供了理论支持和方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Context bias refers to the association between the foreground objects and
background during the object detection training process. Various methods have
been proposed to minimize the context bias when applying the trained model to
an unseen domain, known as domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD). But a
principled approach to understand why the context bias occurs and how to remove
it has been missing.
  In this work, we provide a causal view of the context bias, pointing towards
the pooling operation in the convolution network architecture as the possible
source of this bias. We present an alternative, Mask Pooling, which uses an
additional input of foreground masks, to separate the pooling process in the
respective foreground and background regions and show that this process leads
the trained model to detect objects in a more robust manner under different
domains. We also provide a benchmark designed to create an ultimate test for
DAOD, using foregrounds in the presence of absolute random backgrounds, to
analyze the robustness of the intended trained models. Through these
experiments, we hope to provide a principled approach for minimizing context
bias under domain shift.

Result: BiomechGPT在活动识别、运动障碍识别、诊断、临床评分和步行测量等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BiomechGPT为康复运动数据的通用模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advances in markerless motion capture are expanding access to biomechanical
movement analysis, making it feasible to obtain high-quality movement data from
outpatient clinics, inpatient hospitals, therapy, and even home. Expanding
access to movement data in these diverse contexts makes the challenge of
performing downstream analytics all the more acute. Creating separate bespoke
analysis code for all the tasks end users might want is both intractable and
does not take advantage of the common features of human movement underlying
them all. Recent studies have shown that fine-tuning language models to accept
tokenized movement as an additional modality enables successful descriptive
captioning of movement. Here, we explore whether such a multimodal
motion-language model can answer detailed, clinically meaningful questions
about movement. We collected over 30 hours of biomechanics from nearly 500
participants, many with movement impairments from a variety of etiologies,
performing a range of movements used in clinical outcomes assessments. After
tokenizing these movement trajectories, we created a multimodal dataset of
motion-related questions and answers spanning a range of tasks. We developed
BiomechGPT, a multimodal biomechanics-language model, on this dataset. Our
results show that BiomechGPT demonstrates high performance across a range of
tasks such as activity recognition, identifying movement impairments,
diagnosis, scoring clinical outcomes, and measuring walking. BiomechGPT
provides an important step towards a foundation model for rehabilitation
movement data.

Motivation: 当前人脸修复方法在保持高保真度和避免伪影方面存在挑战，需要更“诚实”的模型以准确反映原始特征。

Method: HonestFace结合身份嵌入器、掩膜人脸对齐技术和基于地标的评估指标，采用一步扩散模型框架。

Result: 实验表明，HonestFace在视觉质量和定量评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HonestFace通过创新技术实现了高保真度和真实感的人脸修复，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Face restoration has achieved remarkable advancements through the years of
development. However, ensuring that restored facial images exhibit high
fidelity, preserve authentic features, and avoid introducing artifacts or
biases remains a significant challenge. This highlights the need for models
that are more "honest" in their reconstruction from low-quality inputs,
accurately reflecting original characteristics. In this work, we propose
HonestFace, a novel approach designed to restore faces with a strong emphasis
on such honesty, particularly concerning identity consistency and texture
realism. To achieve this, HonestFace incorporates several key components.
First, we propose an identity embedder to effectively capture and preserve
crucial identity features from both the low-quality input and multiple
reference faces. Second, a masked face alignment method is presented to enhance
fine-grained details and textural authenticity, thereby preventing the
generation of patterned or overly synthetic textures and improving overall
clarity. Furthermore, we present a new landmark-based evaluation metric. Based
on affine transformation principles, this metric improves the accuracy compared
to conventional L2 distance calculations for facial feature alignment.
Leveraging these contributions within a one-step diffusion model framework,
HonestFace delivers exceptional restoration results in terms of facial fidelity
and realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
visual quality and quantitative assessments. The code and pre-trained models
will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jkwang28/HonestFace .

Motivation: 浮游动物监测对海洋科学研究至关重要，但现有计算机视觉工具难以区分浮游动物与背景。

Method: 提出ZooplanktonBench数据集，包含丰富的地理空间元数据，并定义检测、分类和跟踪任务。

Result: 数据集为计算机视觉系统提供了独特挑战，促进其在动态环境中的改进。

Conclusion: ZooplanktonBench为浮游动物监测和计算机视觉研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Plankton are small drifting organisms found throughout the world's oceans.
One component of this plankton community is the zooplankton, which includes
gelatinous animals and crustaceans (e.g. shrimp), as well as the early life
stages (i.e., eggs and larvae) of many commercially important fishes. Being
able to monitor zooplankton abundances accurately and understand how
populations change in relation to ocean conditions is invaluable to marine
science research, with important implications for future marine seafood
productivity. While new imaging technologies generate massive amounts of video
data of zooplankton, analyzing them using general-purpose computer vision tools
developed for general objects turns out to be highly challenging due to the
high similarity in appearance between the zooplankton and its background (e.g.,
marine snow). In this work, we present the ZooplanktonBench, a benchmark
dataset containing images and videos of zooplankton associated with rich
geospatial metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, depth, etc.) in various
water ecosystems. ZooplanktonBench defines a collection of tasks to detect,
classify, and track zooplankton in challenging settings, including highly
cluttered environments, living vs non-living classification, objects with
similar shapes, and relatively small objects. Our dataset presents unique
challenges and opportunities for state-of-the-art computer vision systems to
evolve and improve visual understanding in a dynamic environment with huge
variations and be geo-aware.

Result: 实验表明，基于新标准构建的数据集提供了更好的几何上下文，有助于复杂3D空间条件下的文本渲染。

Conclusion: 新方法通过引入三维特征改进了合成数据集，为未来场景文本渲染技术提供了更稳健的基础。

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the challenge of insufficient
three-dimensional context in synthetic datasets for scene text rendering.
Although recent advances in diffusion models and related techniques have
improved certain aspects of scene text generation, most existing approaches
continue to rely on 2D data, sourcing authentic training examples from movie
posters and book covers, which limits their ability to capture the complex
interactions among spatial layout and visual effects in real-world scenes. In
particular, traditional 2D datasets do not provide the necessary geometric cues
for accurately embedding text into diverse backgrounds. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel standard for constructing synthetic datasets
that incorporates surface normals to enrich three-dimensional scene
characteristic. By adding surface normals to conventional 2D data, our approach
aims to enhance the representation of spatial relationships and provide a more
robust foundation for future scene text rendering methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that datasets built under this new standard offer
improved geometric context, facilitating further advancements in text rendering
under complex 3D-spatial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大型视觉语言模型（Med-LVLMs）在视觉输入上的注意力分布不佳，导致输出不准确或幻觉。现有方法依赖推理时干预，效果有限。

Method: A$^3$Tune利用SAM的零样本弱标签，通过BioMedCLIP细化为提示感知标签，并选择性调整关键注意力头。引入A$^3$MoE模块，实现跨提示和图像的自适应参数选择。

Result: 在医学VQA和报告生成基准测试中，A$^3$Tune优于现有方法，显著改善了注意力分布和模型性能。

Conclusion: A$^3$Tune通过自动注意力对齐，有效提升了Med-LVLMs的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) often exhibit suboptimal
attention distribution on visual inputs, leading to hallucinated or inaccurate
outputs. Existing mitigation methods primarily rely on inference-time
interventions, which are limited in attention adaptation or require additional
supervision. To address this, we propose A$^3$Tune, a novel fine-tuning
framework for Automatic Attention Alignment Tuning. A$^3$Tune leverages
zero-shot weak labels from SAM, refines them into prompt-aware labels using
BioMedCLIP, and then selectively modifies visually-critical attention heads to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过减少噪声空间中的扩散轨迹混合（称为“不可混合扩散”）来加速扩散模型训练的方法，并扩展了其实现方式，包括KNN噪声选择和图像缩放，实现了高达4倍的训练加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高训练成本限制了其应用，因此需要一种更高效的训练方法。

Method: 通过减少噪声空间中的扩散轨迹混合（不可混合扩散），并扩展实现方式（如KNN噪声选择和图像缩放）来简化去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种任务中实现了高达4倍的训练加速，同时保持了生成多样性。

Conclusion: 不可混合扩散为高效扩散模型训练提供了新方向，并揭示了最优传输（OT）在扩散训练中的作用。

Abstract: The substantial training cost of diffusion models hinders their deployment.
Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing
in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying
denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear
assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept
to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation.
Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising
process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of
generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show
step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency.
Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations
including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce
miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and
tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and
robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel
perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By
identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this
work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into
high-efficiency diffusion training. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统单模态网络（如CNN和Transformer）在3D医学图像分割中存在计算效率低和上下文建模受限的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 使用EGSC模块捕获空间信息；2. 扩展GR-KAN为3D-GR-KAN，首次应用于3D医学图像；3. 采用双分支文本驱动策略结合CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 在MSD和KiTS23数据集上实现了最先进的性能，准确性和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合序列建模、扩展网络架构和视觉-语言协同，为3D医学图像分割提供了可扩展的临床解决方案。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment
but is challenged by high-dimensional data and complex spatial dependencies.
Traditional single-modality networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, are often
limited by computational inefficiency and constrained contextual modeling in 3D
settings. We introduce a novel multimodal framework that leverages Mamba and
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an efficient backbone for long-sequence
modeling. Our approach features three key innovations: First, an EGSC (Enhanced
Gated Spatial Convolution) module captures spatial information when unfolding
3D images into 1D sequences. Second, we extend Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN), a
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks variant with rational basis functions, into
3D-Group-Rational KAN (3D-GR-KAN) for 3D medical imaging - its first
application in this domain - enabling superior feature representation tailored
to volumetric data. Third, a dual-branch text-driven strategy leverages CLIP's
text embeddings: one branch swaps one-hot labels for semantic vectors to
preserve inter-organ semantic relationships, while the other aligns images with
detailed organ descriptions to enhance semantic alignment. Experiments on the
Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) and KiTS23 datasets show our method
achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in
accuracy and efficiency. This work highlights the power of combining advanced
sequence modeling, extended network architectures, and vision-language synergy
to push forward 3D medical image segmentation, delivering a scalable solution
for clinical use. The source code is openly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频中处理时间敏感查询时表现不佳，主要因未能整合时空信息。

Method: 提出ThinkVideo框架，利用MLLM的CoT能力提取对象选择性，结合图像分割模型和SAM2处理器生成掩码序列。

Result: 在显式和隐式查询的视频对象分割任务中，ThinkVideo显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkVideo是一种无需训练、兼容闭源MLLM的框架，适用于在线视频流和复杂查询场景。

Abstract: Reasoning Video Object Segmentation is a challenging task, which generates a
mask sequence from an input video and an implicit, complex text query. Existing
works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult
cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the
failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we
propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges.
Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object
selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning
image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The
ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs,
which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further
extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update
the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes
visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with
explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly
outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DenoisingGait的新方法，利用生成扩散模型和几何驱动的特征匹配模块，去除步态视频中的无关信息，提升识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于轮廓和姿态的方法因输入稀疏且信息不足，难以高精度去除步态视频中的无关线索（如衣物纹理和颜色）。

Method: 结合生成扩散模型和几何驱动的特征匹配模块，通过背景去除和多通道特征压缩，生成流式步态表示Gait Feature Field。

Result: 在CCPG、CASIA-B*和SUSTech1K数据集上，DenoisingGait在多数情况下达到了新的SoTA性能。

Conclusion: DenoisingGait通过创新的去噪和特征表示方法，显著提升了步态识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in
walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent
challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette- and
pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such
distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less
informative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly
denoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose
DenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that
"what I cannot create, I do not understand", we turn to generative diffusion
models, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait
understanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching
module, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,
condenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a
two-channel direction vector. Specifically, the proposed within- and
cross-frame matching respectively capture the local vectorized structures of
gait appearance and motion, producing a novel flow-like gait representation
termed Gait Feature Field, which further reduces residual noise in diffusion
features. Experiments on the CCPG, CASIA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate
that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both
within- and cross-domain evaluations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的稳定扩散模型（SD）在视觉对应任务中表现优异，但扩散变换器（DiTs）存在“大规模激活”问题，导致性能下降，需要解决。

Method: 提出DiTF框架，利用AdaLN-zero定位和归一化大规模激活，并采用通道丢弃策略消除其负面影响。

Result: DiTF在多个视觉对应任务中表现优于DINO和SD模型，性能提升显著（如Spair-71k上提升9.4%）。

Conclusion: DiTF通过解决DiTs的大规模激活问题，显著提升了其在视觉对应任务中的性能，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained stable diffusion models (SD) have shown great advances in visual
correspondence. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) for accurate dense correspondence. Distinct from SD, DiTs
exhibit a critical phenomenon in which very few feature activations exhibit
significantly larger values than others, known as \textit{massive activations},
leading to uninformative representations and significant performance
degradation for DiTs. The massive activations consistently concentrate at very
few fixed dimensions across all image patch tokens, holding little local
information. We trace these dimension-concentrated massive activations and find
that such concentration can be effectively localized by the zero-initialized
Adaptive Layer Norm (AdaLN-zero). Building on these findings, we propose
Diffusion Transformer Feature (DiTF), a training-free framework designed to
extract semantic-discriminative features from DiTs. Specifically, DiTF employs
AdaLN to adaptively localize and normalize massive activations with
channel-wise modulation. In addition, we develop a channel discard strategy to
further eliminate the negative impacts from massive activations. Experimental
results demonstrate that our DiTF outperforms both DINO and SD-based models and
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance for DiTs in different visual
correspondence tasks (\eg, with +9.4\% on Spair-71k and +4.4\% on AP-10K-C.S.).

Motivation: 当前Soft MoE模型中的分配权重隐含了语义结构但未显式对齐，导致专家路由效果不佳。

Method: 引入空间感知辅助损失和LayerScale机制，增强专家激活与语义前景区域的对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等基准测试中表现提升，专家路由机制更可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量架构调整即可显著提升Soft MoE模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising direction for
scaling vision architectures efficiently. Among them, Soft MoE improves
training stability by assigning each token to all experts via continuous
dispatch weights. However, current designs overlook the semantic structure
which is implicitly encoded in these weights, resulting in suboptimal expert
routing. In this paper, we discover that dispatch weights in Soft MoE
inherently exhibit segmentation-like patterns but are not explicitly aligned
with semantic regions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a
foreground-guided enhancement strategy. Specifically, we introduce a spatially
aware auxiliary loss that encourages expert activation to align with semantic
foreground regions. To further reinforce this supervision, we integrate a
lightweight LayerScale mechanism that improves information flow and stabilizes
optimization in skip connections. Our method necessitates only minor
architectural adjustments and can be seamlessly integrated into prevailing Soft
MoE frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and multiple
smaller-scale classification benchmarks not only showcase consistent
performance enhancements but also reveal more interpretable expert routing
mechanisms.

Motivation: 当前Deepfake检测方法在RGB数据上受限，难以泛化到不同操纵技术和数据集。

Result: HyperFake能够更准确、泛化地检测不同Deepfake风格和数据集。

Conclusion: 首次利用高光谱成像重建检测Deepfake，为检测复杂操纵提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose a significant threat to digital media security, with current
detection methods struggling to generalize across different manipulation
techniques and datasets. While recent approaches combine CNN-based
architectures with Vision Transformers or leverage multi-modal learning, they
remain limited by the inherent constraints of RGB data. We introduce HyperFake,
a novel deepfake detection pipeline that reconstructs 31-channel hyperspectral
data from standard RGB videos, revealing hidden manipulation traces invisible
to conventional methods. Using an improved MST++ architecture, HyperFake
enhances hyperspectral reconstruction, while a spectral attention mechanism
selects the most critical spectral features for deepfake detection. The refined
spectral data is then processed by an EfficientNet-based classifier optimized
for spectral analysis, enabling more accurate and generalizable detection
across different deepfake styles and datasets, all without the need for
expensive hyperspectral cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach to leverage hyperspectral imaging reconstruction for deepfake
detection, opening new possibilities for detecting increasingly sophisticated
manipulations.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言检索方法忽略实体的视觉语义知识，导致错误结果。

Result: 在图像-文本检索基准测试中，EvdCLIP表现优越。

Conclusion: EvdCLIP通过EVD和EaRW显著提升了视觉语言检索的准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval (VLR) has attracted significant attention in both
academia and industry, which involves using text (or images) as queries to
retrieve corresponding images (or text). However, existing methods often
neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to
incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity
Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual
knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize
entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to
generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement
textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create
visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced
queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel,
trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW
utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to
effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can
generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks
validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现代SISR模型在训练尺度内表现良好，但在超出训练范围时性能崩溃，因此需要一种能够灵活扩展的解决方案。

Method: CoZ将SISR分解为自回归链式多尺度状态，利用多尺度感知提示和预训练的SR模型，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）生成文本提示，并通过GRPO优化提示提取器。

Result: 实验表明，标准的4x扩散SR模型在CoZ框架下可实现256x以上的放大，同时保持高质量和保真度。

Conclusion: CoZ提供了一种无需额外训练即可实现极端分辨率提升的通用框架，解决了SISR模型的扩展性瓶颈。

Abstract: Modern single-image super-resolution (SISR) models deliver photo-realistic
results at the scale factors on which they are trained, but collapse when asked
to magnify far beyond that regime. We address this scalability bottleneck with
Chain-of-Zoom (CoZ), a model-agnostic framework that factorizes SISR into an
autoregressive chain of intermediate scale-states with multi-scale-aware
prompts. CoZ repeatedly re-uses a backbone SR model, decomposing the
conditional probability into tractable sub-problems to achieve extreme
resolutions without additional training. Because visual cues diminish at high
magnifications, we augment each zoom step with multi-scale-aware text prompts
generated by a vision-language model (VLM). The prompt extractor itself is
fine-tuned using Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a critic
VLM, aligning text guidance towards human preference. Experiments show that a
standard 4x diffusion SR model wrapped in CoZ attains beyond 256x enlargement
with high perceptual quality and fidelity.

Motivation: 现有因果掩码策略源自纯文本模型，对视觉查询的适应性不足，限制了模型利用未来语义线索的能力。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级注意力机制，通过池化将未来视觉上下文聚合到过去表示中，同时保持自回归结构。

Result: 实验表明，选择性压缩未来语义上下文能提升视觉语言推断的性能。

Conclusion: 未来感知注意力机制在保持自回归性的同时，增强了跨令牌依赖关系，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Causal attention has become a foundational mechanism in autoregressive
vision-language models (VLMs), unifying textual and visual inputs under a
single generative framework. However, existing causal mask-based strategies are
inherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for
text-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently
addressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision
queries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability
to leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for
accurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different
causal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a
family of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting. We first
empirically analyze the effect of previewing future tokens for vision queries
and demonstrate that rigid masking undermines the model's capacity to capture
useful contextual semantic representations. Based on these findings, we propose
a lightweight attention family that aggregates future visual context into past
representations via pooling, effectively preserving the autoregressive
structure while enhancing cross-token dependencies. We evaluate a range of
causal masks across diverse vision-language inference settings and show that
selectively compressing future semantic context into past representations
benefits the inference.

TL;DR: Spiking Transformers通过二进制脉冲传输信息，但性能低于人工神经网络。研究发现脉冲神经元偏好低频信息，高频信息丢失是性能下降主因。Max-Former通过高频增强操作（如Max-Pooling和Depth-Wise Convolution）显著提升性能。

Motivation: 揭示Spiking Transformers性能低于人工神经网络的原因，并提出解决方案以提升其性能。

Method: 提出Max-Former，采用Max-Pooling和Depth-Wise Convolution增强高频信号。

Result: Max-Former在ImageNet上达到82.39%的top-1准确率，比Spikformer提升7.58%。

Conclusion: Max-Former通过高频增强操作显著提升Spiking Transformers性能，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Spiking Transformers offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning by transmitting information solely through binary (0/1) spikes.
However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to artificial
neural networks. A common belief is that their binary and sparse activation
transmission leads to information loss, thus degrading feature representation
and accuracy. In this work, however, we reveal for the first time that spiking
neurons preferentially propagate low-frequency information. We hypothesize that
the rapid dissipation of high-frequency components is the primary cause of
performance degradation. For example, on Cifar-100, adopting Avg-Pooling
(low-pass) for token mixing lowers performance to 76.73%; interestingly,
replacing it with Max-Pooling (high-pass) pushes the top-1 accuracy to 79.12%,
surpassing the well-tuned Spikformer baseline by 0.97%. Accordingly, we
introduce Max-Former that restores high-frequency signals through two
frequency-enhancing operators: extra Max-Pooling in patch embedding and
Depth-Wise Convolution in place of self-attention. Notably, our Max-Former
(63.99 M) hits the top-1 accuracy of 82.39% on ImageNet, showing a +7.58%
improvement over Spikformer with comparable model size (74.81%, 66.34 M). We
hope this simple yet effective solution inspires future research to explore the
distinctive nature of spiking neural networks, beyond the established practice
in standard deep learning.

Result: 在扩展基准测试中取得最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多概念个性化任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of
user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in
multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle
to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun
exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they
require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and
prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a
novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively
customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our
method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful
properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module,
Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the
modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates
vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into
the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused
by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we
introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image
understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic
supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard
benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by
quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

Conclusion: SuperGS通过改进训练策略和场景表示，有效解决了3DGS在高分辨率场景中的局限性，实现了更高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has excelled in novel view synthesis
(NVS) with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However,
it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due
to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To
address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed
with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution
stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution
scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for
super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a
multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution
depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism,
mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo
labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy.
Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use
it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory
effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art
HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，ProphetDWM在视频生成和动作预测任务中表现最佳，支持高质量长期生成。

Conclusion: ProphetDWM通过联合学习动作动态和状态，显著提升了驾驶世界模型的预测能力。

Abstract: Real-world driving requires people to observe the current environment,
anticipate the future, and make appropriate driving decisions. This requirement
is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the
environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous
driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by
controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models
should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction.
Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the
video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the
dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel
end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions.
Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to
the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a
diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The
model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and
predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics
and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in
video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency
and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term
video and action generation.

Motivation: 复杂工业环境中，现有视觉定位方法存在光照敏感、计算量大或环境限制等问题，手工特征与学习特征的互补性未被充分利用。

Method: 框架结合实时手工特征提取（用于相对位姿估计）和选择性学习关键点检测（用于绝对定位），实现CPU高效定位。

Conclusion: 通过特征互补和分层设计，实现了高效、鲁棒的长期视觉定位。

Abstract: Robust long-term visual localization in complex industrial environments is
critical for mobile robotic systems. Existing approaches face limitations:
handcrafted features are illumination-sensitive, learned features are
computationally intensive, and semantic- or marker-based methods are
environmentally constrained. Handcrafted and learned features share similar
representations but differ functionally. Handcrafted features are optimized for
continuous tracking, while learned features excel in wide-baseline matching.
Their complementarity calls for integration rather than replacement. Building
on this, we propose a hierarchical localization framework. It leverages
real-time handcrafted feature extraction for relative pose estimation. In
parallel, it employs selective learned keypoint detection on optimized
keyframes for absolute positioning. This design enables CPU-efficient,
long-term visual localization. Experiments systematically progress through
three validation phases: Initially establishing feature complementarity through
comparative analysis, followed by computational latency profiling across
algorithm stages on CPU platforms. Final evaluation under photometric
variations (including seasonal transitions and diurnal cycles) demonstrates 47%
average error reduction with significantly improved localization consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像日益逼真，威胁社交媒体信息真实性，现有数据集和方法在多样性和泛化能力上不足。

Method: 提出So-Fake-Set数据集（200万图像，35种生成模型）和So-Fake-OOD基准（10万图像），开发So-Fake-R1框架（结合强化学习和视觉语言模型）。

Result: So-Fake-R1在检测准确率上提升1.3%，定位IoU提升4.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过数据集、基准和检测框架的结合，为社交媒体伪造检测研究奠定新基础，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of
increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to
information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust
detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to
mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope:
current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social
media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen
generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a
comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality
images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized
using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate
cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K)
out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from
commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating
a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these
resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that
employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise
localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual
rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the
second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase
in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD
benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new
foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code,
models, and datasets will be released publicly.

Motivation: 现有视频DiT模型的量化方法依赖耗时校准且性能下降严重，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 提出PBQ、ARQ和δ-GBS三种创新技术，实现无校准数据的高效量化。

Result: 在多个视频生成基准测试中，DVD-Quant实现约2倍加速，且首次支持W4A4 PTQ而不损失质量。

Conclusion: DVD-Quant为视频DiT模型的量化提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art
architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands
hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a
promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from
two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy
calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after
quantization. To address these challenges, we propose DVD-Quant, a novel
Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three
key innovations: (1) Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ) and (2)
Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization (ARQ) for calibration data-free quantization
error reduction, as well as (3) $\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS)
for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video
generation benchmarks demonstrate that DVD-Quant achieves an approximately
2$\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while
maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, DVD-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ
for Video DiTs without compromising video quality. Code and models will be

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by
combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information.
However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to
advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is
constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 330
chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses
them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this
dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning,
2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling
example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and
structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource
for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在恢复高保真图像和对象级着色控制方面的不足，尤其是扩散模型在细节保留上的缺陷。

Method: 利用预训练的Stable Diffusion模型作为生成先验，引入IIDE技术增强内部图像细节，结合退化操作模拟退化效果。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中显著优于现有模型，支持文本引导恢复和对象级着色控制。

Conclusion: 该方法在恢复退化图像时能高效保留细节，并提供灵活的控制能力，适用于专业级图像编辑。

Abstract: Restoring real-world degraded images, such as old photographs or
low-resolution images, presents a significant challenge due to the complex,
mixed degradations they exhibit, such as scratches, color fading, and noise.
Recent data-driven approaches have struggled with two main challenges:
achieving high-fidelity restoration and providing object-level control over
colorization. While diffusion models have shown promise in generating
high-quality images with specific controls, they often fail to fully preserve
image details during restoration. In this work, we propose an internal
detail-preserving diffusion model for high-fidelity restoration of real-world
degraded images. Our method utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model as a
generative prior, eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. Central
to our approach is the Internal Image Detail Enhancement (IIDE) technique,
which directs the diffusion model to preserve essential structural and textural
information while mitigating degradation effects. The process starts by mapping
the input image into a latent space, where we inject the diffusion denoising
process with degradation operations that simulate the effects of various
degradation factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both qualitative
assessments and perceptual quantitative evaluations. Additionally, our approach
supports text-guided restoration, enabling object-level colorization control
that mimics the expertise of professional photo editing.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度视觉推理任务上的能力未充分评估，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出ReasonMap基准，包含高分辨率交通地图和多样化问题，设计两级评估流程。

Result: 开源基础模型表现优于推理模型，闭源模型反之；视觉输入被掩码时性能下降。

Conclusion: ReasonMap为视觉推理研究提供新视角，揭示了开源与闭源模型的差异。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
progress in visual tasks, including semantic scene understanding and text-image
alignment, with reasoning variants enhancing performance on complex tasks
involving mathematics and logic. However, their capacity for reasoning tasks
involving fine-grained visual understanding remains insufficiently evaluated.
To address this gap, we introduce ReasonMap, a benchmark designed to assess the
fine-grained visual understanding and spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs.
ReasonMap encompasses high-resolution transit maps from 30 cities across 13
countries and includes 1,008 question-answer pairs spanning two question types
and three templates. Furthermore, we design a two-level evaluation pipeline
that properly assesses answer correctness and quality. Comprehensive
evaluations of 15 popular MLLMs, including both base and reasoning variants,
reveal a counterintuitive pattern: among open-source models, base models
outperform reasoning ones, while the opposite trend is observed in
closed-source models. Additionally, performance generally degrades when visual
inputs are masked, indicating that while MLLMs can leverage prior knowledge to
answer some questions, fine-grained visual reasoning tasks still require
genuine visual perception for strong performance. Our benchmark study offers
new insights into visual reasoning and contributes to investigating the gap
between open-source and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像恢复方法通常将问题视为直接映射，忽略了退化类型的结构多样性，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: MIRAGE将输入特征分解为三个并行分支（全局上下文、局部纹理、通道统计），并在SPD流形空间中进行跨层对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，MIRAGE在多种退化类型下均达到最优性能，且具有高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为多退化图像恢复提供了统一的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Image Restoration (IR) aims to recover high quality images from degraded
inputs affected by various corruptions such as noise, blur, haze, rain, and low
light conditions. Despite recent advances, most existing approaches treat IR as
a direct mapping problem, relying on shared representations across degradation
types without modeling their structural diversity. In this work, we present
MIRAGE, a unified and lightweight framework for all in one IR that explicitly
decomposes the input feature space into three semantically aligned parallel
branches, each processed by a specialized module attention for global context,
convolution for local textures, and MLP for channel-wise statistics. This
modular decomposition significantly improves generalization and efficiency
across diverse degradations. Furthermore, we introduce a cross layer
contrastive learning scheme that aligns shallow and latent features to enhance
the discriminability of shared representations. To better capture the
underlying geometry of feature representations, we perform contrastive learning
in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold space rather than the
conventional Euclidean space. Extensive experiments show that MIRAGE not only
achieves new state of the art performance across a variety of degradation types
but also offers a scalable solution for challenging all-in-one IR scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的WREC和WRES任务独立建模，但作者认为联合学习可以带来性能提升。

Method: 采用双分支架构，WREC分支基于锚点对比学习，同时监督WRES分支；引入DVFE和CCM促进多任务协作。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg等基准测试中，WeakMCN表现优于单任务方法，WREC和WRES任务分别提升3.91%和13.11%。

Conclusion: WeakMCN在多任务和半监督设置下均表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Weakly supervised referring expression comprehension(WREC) and
segmentation(WRES) aim to learn object grounding based on a given expression
using weak supervision signals like image-text pairs. While these tasks have
traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from
joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a
novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES
with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as
anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise
the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate
multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement(DVFE) and
Collaborative Consistency Module(CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various
pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM
promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive
experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO,
RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN
over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on
RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also
validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised
REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and
+7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: AIEdiT为情感图像编辑提供了新方法，并引入大规模数据集支持研究。

Abstract: In daily life, images as common affective stimuli have widespread
applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there
is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this
paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions,
which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors
across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the
continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To
manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate
visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic
representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we
introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we
strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding
emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions.
Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the
emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively
reflecting users' emotional requests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地理定位方法缺乏鲁棒的推理机制和可解释性，限制了其有效性。

Method: GRE Suite包含三个关键维度：数据集（GRE30K）、模型（GRE）和评估基准（GREval-Bench）。GRE模型采用多阶段推理策略逐步推断场景属性。

Result: 实验表明，GRE在所有地理定位任务粒度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRE Suite证明了推理增强的VLM在复杂地理推理中的高效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization
presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual
cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for
systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack
robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness.
To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE)
Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains
for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is
systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and
benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization
reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual
analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning
strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic
features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced
precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark
(GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across
diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained
(e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly
outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization
tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex
geographic inference. Code and data will be released at

Result: ConvNeXT在AUC、准确率和F-score上均优于EfficientNet。

Conclusion: ConvNeXT在乳腺癌预测中表现更佳，具有更高的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. This cancer
caused 670,000 deaths globally in 2022, as reported by the WHO. Yet since
health officials began routine mammography screening in age groups deemed at
risk in the 1980s, breast cancer mortality has decreased by 40% in high-income
nations. Every day, a greater and greater number of people are receiving a
breast cancer diagnosis. Reducing cancer-related deaths requires early
detection and treatment. This paper compares two convolutional neural networks
called ConvNeXT and EfficientNet to predict the likelihood of cancer in
mammograms from screening exams. Preprocessing of the images, classification,
and performance evaluation are main parts of the whole procedure. Several
evaluation metrics were used to compare and evaluate the performance of the
models. The result shows that ConvNeXT generates better results with a 94.33%
AUC score, 93.36% accuracy, and 95.13% F-score compared to EfficientNet with a
92.34% AUC score, 91.47% accuracy, and 93.06% F-score on RSNA screening

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object tracking (MVMOT) has found widespread applications in
intelligent transportation, surveillance systems, and urban management.
However, existing studies rarely address genuinely free-viewpoint MVMOT
systems, which could significantly enhance the flexibility and scalability of
cooperative tracking systems. To bridge this gap, we first construct the
Multi-Drone Multi-Object Tracking (MDMOT) dataset, captured by mobile drone
swarms across diverse real-world scenarios, initially establishing the first
benchmark for multi-object tracking in arbitrary multi-view environment.
Building upon this foundation, we propose \textbf{FusionTrack}, an end-to-end
framework that reasonably integrates tracking and re-identification to leverage
multi-view information for robust trajectory association. Extensive experiments
on our MDMOT and other benchmark datasets demonstrate that FusionTrack achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both single-view and multi-view tracking.

Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注生成图像与提示的显式对齐，忽略了与超出提示的真实世界知识的对齐，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 设计了包含2000多个提示的ABP基准，提出ABPScore评估指标，并引入ITKI策略优化模型表现。

Result: 评估了8个流行的T2I模型，发现即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在整合真实世界知识方面仍有局限；ITKI策略使ABPScore提升了约43%。

Conclusion: ABP基准和ITKI策略有效提升了模型在生成图像时与真实世界知识的对齐性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have advanced significantly,
enabling the creation of high-fidelity images from textual prompts. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on the explicit alignment
between generated images and prompts, neglecting the alignment with real-world
knowledge beyond prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Align Beyond
Prompts (ABP), a comprehensive benchmark designed to measure the alignment of
generated images with real-world knowledge that extends beyond the explicit
user prompts. ABP comprises over 2,000 meticulously crafted prompts, covering
real-world knowledge across six distinct scenarios. We further introduce
ABPScore, a metric that utilizes existing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to assess the alignment between generated images and world knowledge
beyond prompts, which demonstrates strong correlations with human judgments.
Through a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular T2I models using ABP, we find
that even state-of-the-art models, such as GPT-4o, face limitations in
integrating simple real-world knowledge into generated images. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce a training-free strategy within ABP, named Inference-Time
Knowledge Injection (ITKI). By applying this strategy to optimize 200
challenging samples, we achieved an improvement of approximately 43% in
ABPScore. The dataset and code are available in

In this work, we propose a novel and orthogonal approach to enhancing
diffusion-based preference optimization. First, we introduce a stable reference
model update strategy that relaxes the frozen reference model, encouraging
exploration while maintaining a stable optimization anchor through reference
model regularization. Second, we present a timestep-aware training strategy
that mitigates the reward scale imbalance problem across timesteps. Our method
can be integrated into various preference optimization algorithms. Experimental
results show that our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art
methods on human preference evaluation benchmarks.

### [306] [MoMBS: Mixed-order minibatch sampling enhances model training from diverse-quality images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18741)
*Han Li,Hu Han,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合顺序小批量采样方法（MoMBS），通过结合损失和不确定性来优化多样质量训练样本的使用，解决了传统方法中样本硬度测量不精确和样本利用不足或过度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像在通用病变检测（ULD）中存在图像质量多样性（如清晰度和标签正确性），传统训练方法（如SCL和OHEM）在样本硬度测量和利用上存在不足。

Method: 提出MoMBS方法，结合损失和不确定性测量样本硬度，并通过混合顺序小批量采样设计优化样本利用。

Result: MoMBS能够更精确地处理多样质量样本，优先利用代表性不足的样本，避免受噪声或过拟合样本的负面影响。

Conclusion: MoMBS为处理多样质量训练样本提供了一种有效方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Natural images exhibit label diversity (clean vs. noisy) in noisy-labeled
image classification and prevalence diversity (abundant vs. sparse) in
long-tailed image classification. Similarly, medical images in universal lesion
detection (ULD) exhibit substantial variations in image quality, encompassing
attributes such as clarity and label correctness. How to effectively leverage
training images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep
models. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum
learning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by
reweighting images with high loss values. Despite their success, these methods
still confront two challenges: (i) the loss-based measure of sample hardness is
imprecise, preventing optimum handling of different cases, and (ii) there
exists under-utilization in SCL or over-utilization OHEM with the identified
hard samples. To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch
sampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely
unexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We
discover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during
training; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)
method to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS
introduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to
surpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of
high-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under
represented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented
samples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the
negative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order
minibatch sampling design.

*Umar Marikkar,Syed Sameed Husain,Muhammad Awais,Sara Atito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为C3R的框架，通过将细胞图像通道分为上下文和概念两类，解决了IHC图像数据因通道不一致导致的深度学习模型泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC图像因实验室和研究的染色协议不同，导致通道数量和配置不一致，现有方法无法支持跨数据集的零样本评估。

Method: 提出C3R框架，包括基于上下文-概念原则的通道自适应编码器架构和掩码知识蒸馏训练策略。

Result: C3R在分布内和分布外任务上均优于现有基准，且在CHAMMI基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: C3R为IHC数据集的跨数据集泛化提供了新途径，无需数据集特定适配或重新训练。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) images reveal detailed information about structures
and functions at the subcellular level. However, unlike natural images, IHC
datasets pose challenges for deep learning models due to their inconsistencies
in channel count and configuration, stemming from varying staining protocols
across laboratories and studies. Existing approaches build channel-adaptive
models, which unfortunately fail to support out-of-distribution (OOD)
evaluation across IHC datasets and cannot be applied in a true zero-shot
setting with mismatched channel counts. To address this, we introduce a
structured view of cellular image channels by grouping them into either context
or concept, where we treat the context channels as a reference to the concept
channels in the image. We leverage this context-concept principle to develop
Channel Conditioned Cell Representations (C3R), a framework designed for
unified evaluation on in-distribution (ID) and OOD datasets. C3R is a two-fold
framework comprising a channel-adaptive encoder architecture and a masked
knowledge distillation training strategy, both built around the context-concept
principle. We find that C3R outperforms existing benchmarks on both ID and OOD
tasks, while a trivial implementation of our core idea also outperforms the
channel-adaptive methods reported on the CHAMMI benchmark. Our method opens a
new pathway for cross-dataset generalization between IHC datasets, without
requiring dataset-specific adaptation or retraining.

*Duo Li,Zuhao Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ToDRE框架，通过基于多样性和任务相关性的视觉令牌剪枝，显著减少计算开销，提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型中视觉输入令牌过多导致计算开销大，现有方法多依赖令牌重要性，忽略了多样性和任务相关性。

Method: ToDRE采用两阶段无训练令牌压缩框架，结合贪婪k-center算法选择多样令牌，并在解码器中剪枝任务无关令牌。

Result: 实验显示ToDRE减少90%视觉令牌，推理速度提升2.6倍，性能保持95.1%，兼容高效注意力算子。

Conclusion: ToDRE通过多样性和任务相关性剪枝，有效平衡计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: The representation of visual inputs of large vision-language models (LVLMs)
usually involves substantially more tokens than that of textual inputs, leading
to significant computational overhead. Several recent studies strive to
mitigate this issue by either conducting token compression to prune redundant
visual tokens or guiding them to bypass certain computational stages. While
most existing work exploits token importance as the redundancy indicator, our
study reveals that two largely neglected factors, namely, the diversity of
retained visual tokens and their task relevance, often offer more robust
criteria in token pruning. To this end, we design ToDRE, a two-stage and
training-free token compression framework that achieves superior performance by
pruning Tokens based on token Diversity and token-task RElevance. Instead of
pruning redundant tokens, ToDRE introduces a greedy k-center algorithm to
select and retain a small subset of diverse visual tokens after the vision
encoder. Additionally, ToDRE addresses the "information migration" by further
eliminating task-irrelevant visual tokens within the decoder of large language
model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that ToDRE effectively reduces 90% of
visual tokens after vision encoder and adaptively prunes all visual tokens
within certain LLM's decoder layers, leading to a 2.6x speed-up in total
inference time while maintaining 95.1% of model performance and excellent
compatibility with efficient attention operators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StyleGuard的新方法，通过优化潜在空间中的风格特征和设计新的损失函数，有效抵御风格模仿攻击，并提升对抗扩散净化方法的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型的广泛应用，风格模仿和个性化定制引发了知识产权保护和虚假内容生成的担忧。现有防御方法易受净化攻击且跨模型迁移性差，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出StyleGuard方法，包括优化潜在空间风格特征的新风格损失和针对扩散净化的新上采样损失，通过集成净化器和上采样器增强扰动能力。

Result: 在WikiArt和CelebA数据集上的实验表明，StyleGuard在对抗多种变换和净化攻击时表现优于现有方法，且对DreamBooth和Textual Inversion等风格模仿方法有效。

Conclusion: StyleGuard通过改进风格损失和上采样损失，显著提升了防御风格模仿攻击的鲁棒性和跨模型迁移性，为知识产权保护提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have been widely used for style
mimicry and personalized customization through methods such as DreamBooth and
Textual Inversion. This has raised concerns about intellectual property
protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as
Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect
images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as
DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses,
showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show
limited transferability across models, making them less effective against
unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel
anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes
the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the
original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to
enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we
designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers
during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets
demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against
various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry
in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry
methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示生成方法在随机种子不同时，对相同输入生成的提示差异较大且效果不佳（提示变异性问题），影响了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出DPSPG框架，通过互补提示生成器生成负提示，减少误导信息，并结合理论分析优化提示的鲁棒性。

Result: 在五个DG基准数据集上的实验表明，DPSPG在性能和提示稳定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPSPG通过负学习有效解决了提示变异性问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model using data from one or
multiple related but distinct source domains that can generalize well to unseen
out-of-distribution target domains. Inspired by the success of large
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), prompt tuning has emerged as an
effective generalization strategy. However, it often struggles to capture
domain-specific features due to its reliance on manually or fixed prompt
inputs. Recently, some prompt generation methods have addressed this limitation
by dynamically generating instance-specific and domain-specific prompts for
each input, enriching domain information and demonstrating potential for
enhanced generalization. Through further investigation, we identify a notable
issue in existing prompt generation methods: the same input often yields
significantly different and suboptimal prompts across different random seeds, a
phenomenon we term Prompt Variability. To address this, we introduce negative
learning into the prompt generation process and propose Dual-Path Stable Soft
Prompt Generation (DPSPG), a transformer-based framework designed to improve
both the stability and generalization of prompts. Specifically, DPSPG
incorporates a complementary prompt generator to produce negative prompts,
thereby reducing the risk of introducing misleading information. Both
theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that negative learning leads to
more robust and effective prompts by increasing the effective margin and
reducing the upper bound of the gradient norm. Extensive experiments on five DG
benchmark datasets show that DPSPG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining prompt stability.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large multimodal models (LMMs), such as the
impressive GPT-4o-Native, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in following
general-purpose instructions for image generation. However, current benchmarks
often lack the necessary breadth and depth to fully evaluate the diverse
capabilities of these models. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
OmniGenBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark meticulously designed to
assess the instruction-following abilities of state-of-the-art LMMs across both
perception-centric and cognition-centric dimensions. Our OmniGenBench includes
57 diverse sub-tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, systematically
categorized according to the specific model capabilities they demand. For
rigorous evaluation, we further employ a dual-mode protocol. This protocol
utilizes off-the-shelf visual parsing tools for perception-centric tasks and a
powerful LLM-based judger for cognition-centric tasks to assess the alignment
between generated images and user instructions. Using OmniGenBench, we evaluate
mainstream generative models, including prevalent models like GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Seedream, and provide in-depth comparisons and analyses
of their performance.Code and data are available at

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，T²A在测试时适应方法中表现最优，显著提升了检测器的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T²A方法有效解决了Deepfake检测器在真实环境中的适应性问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in
real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated
from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution
shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure
generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance
degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think
Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation
method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without
requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable
the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative
Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as
commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce
an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to
improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning
objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation
capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared
to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances
the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference. Code is

TL;DR: VDiTs在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但计算成本高。VORTA通过稀疏注意力机制和自适应路由策略，实现了1.76倍加速且无质量损失，并可与其他加速方法结合，最高提升14.41倍。

Motivation: 解决VDiTs因高维视频序列注意力计算导致的效率问题，尤其是冗余的长程交互。

Method: 提出VORTA框架，包含稀疏注意力机制和自适应路由策略，优化3D注意力计算。

Result: 在VBench上实现1.76倍加速且无质量损失，结合其他方法可达14.41倍加速。

Conclusion: VORTA显著提升VDiTs效率，增强其在实际应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Transformers (VDiTs) have achieved remarkable progress in
high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the
quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent
attention acceleration methods leverage the sparsity of attention patterns to
improve efficiency; however, they often overlook inefficiencies of redundant
long-range interactions. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{VORTA}, an
acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention
mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing
strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse
attention variants throughout the sampling process. It achieves a $1.76\times$
end-to-end speedup without quality loss on VBench. Furthermore, VORTA can
seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as caching
and step distillation, reaching up to $14.41\times$ speedup with negligible
performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the
practicality of VDiTs in real-world settings.

Conclusion: SAMA模型通过统一数据集和基准测试，显著提升了视频多模态模型的细粒度时空理解和定位能力。

Abstract: Achieving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding in videos remains a
major challenge for current Video Large Multimodal Models (Video LMMs).
Addressing this challenge requires mastering two core capabilities: video
referring understanding, which captures the semantics of video regions, and
video grounding, which segments object regions based on natural language
descriptions. However, most existing approaches tackle these tasks in
isolation, limiting progress toward unified, referentially grounded video
interaction. We identify a key bottleneck in the lack of high-quality, unified
video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
referentially grounded video chat. To address these challenges, we contribute
in three core aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce
SAMA-239K, a large-scale dataset comprising 15K videos specifically curated to
enable joint learning of video referring understanding, grounding, and
multi-turn video chat. Second, we propose the SAMA model, which incorporates a
versatile spatio-temporal context aggregator and a Segment Anything Model to
jointly enhance fine-grained video comprehension and precise grounding
capabilities. Finally, we establish SAMA-Bench, a meticulously designed
benchmark consisting of 5,067 questions from 522 videos, to comprehensively
evaluate the integrated capabilities of Video LMMs in multi-turn,
spatio-temporal referring understanding and grounded dialogue. Extensive
experiments and benchmarking results show that SAMA not only achieves strong
performance on SAMA-Bench but also sets a new state-of-the-art on general
grounding benchmarks, while maintaining highly competitive performance on
standard visual understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统3D分词方法（如k近邻或基于半径的分词）对数据集特定空间尺度敏感，导致跨域泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出S4Token分词器，结合超点分组和坐标尺度归一化，通过无监督训练（掩码点建模和聚类目标）和多模态蒸馏对齐3D与2D特征。

Result: S4Token在实验中表现优于传统方法，实现了尺度不变的表示学习。

Conclusion: S4Token为3D场景理解提供了一种高效且通用的分词解决方案，适用于密集预测任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP can offer a promising foundation for 3D
scene understanding when extended with 3D tokenizers. However, standard
approaches, such as k-nearest neighbor or radius-based tokenization, struggle
with cross-domain generalization due to sensitivity to dataset-specific spatial
scales. We present a universal 3D tokenizer designed for scale-invariant
representation learning with a frozen CLIP backbone. We show that combining
superpoint-based grouping with coordinate scale normalization consistently
outperforms conventional methods through extensive experimental analysis.
Specifically, we introduce S4Token, a tokenization pipeline that produces
semantically-informed tokens regardless of scene scale. Our tokenizer is
trained without annotations using masked point modeling and clustering-based
objectives, along with cross-modal distillation to align 3D tokens with 2D
multi-view image features. For dense prediction tasks, we propose a
superpoint-level feature propagation module to recover point-level detail from
sparse tokens.

Motivation: CNN在医学图像分割中难以捕捉全局信息，而Transformer则因计算复杂度和局部特征建模不足而受限，需结合两者优势。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSLAU-Net在几乎所有评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSLAU-Net是一种高效、鲁棒的医学图像分割方法，结合了CNN和Transformer的优势。

Abstract: Both CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable success
in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNN-based methods struggle to
effectively capture global contextual information due to the inherent
limitations of convolution operations. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods
suffer from insufficient local feature modeling and face challenges related to
the high computational complexity caused by the self-attention mechanism. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid CNN-Transformer
architecture, named MSLAU-Net, which integrates the strengths of both
paradigms. The proposed MSLAU-Net incorporates two key ideas. First, it
introduces Multi-Scale Linear Attention, designed to efficiently extract
multi-scale features from medical images while modeling long-range dependencies
with low computational complexity. Second, it adopts a top-down feature
aggregation mechanism, which performs multi-level feature aggregation and
restores spatial resolution using a lightweight structure. Extensive
experiments conducted on benchmark datasets covering three imaging modalities
demonstrate that the proposed MSLAU-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods on nearly all evaluation metrics, validating the superiority,
effectiveness, and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at

Abstract: Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative
models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and
adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based
architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in
this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method
to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT
blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including
PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show
that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the
expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we
apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization
and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach
enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving
task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with
minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings
offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a
practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model
editing.

Abstract: This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across
three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size,

typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance
without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model
configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale
training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify
the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task
performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how
changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings
translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors.

enabling seamless interaction between virtual and physical environments,
fostering immersive experiences such as VR meetings and social engagements.
Additionally, we present VR-Face, a novel dataset comprising 200,000 samples
designed to emulate diverse VR-specific conditions, including occlusions,
lighting variations, and distortions. By addressing fundamental limitations in
current VR systems, RevAvatar exemplifies the transformative synergy between AI
and next-generation technologies, offering a robust platform for enhancing

TL;DR: SVG2提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过语义感知的排列和动态预算控制，显著提升了视频生成的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在生成质量和计算效率上未能达到最优，主要原因是关键令牌识别不准确和计算浪费。

Method: SVG2采用语义感知的k-means聚类和重排令牌，结合动态预算控制和定制内核实现，优化计算布局。

Result: SVG2在HunyuanVideo和Wan 2.1上分别实现了2.30x和1.89x的加速，PSNR分别达到30和26。

Conclusion: SVG2在生成质量和效率之间实现了帕累托最优，为视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer
from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By
computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs
and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that
existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same
computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token
identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than
semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive
computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones,
leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing
contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework
that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste,
achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and
efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and
reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach
ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification
accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient
computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget
control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x
speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan
2.1, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频编辑模型，用于生成具有连贯叙事和嵌入视频片段的短视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提取式视频摘要方法难以生成连贯叙事，而抽象式方法无法从输入视频中引用片段。

Method: 提出检索嵌入生成框架（REGen），结合大型语言模型生成脚本并通过检索模型选择最佳视频片段。

Result: 在纪录片预告生成任务中，该方法能有效插入视频片段并保持叙事连贯性。

Conclusion: 主观评估显示，该方法在连贯性、对齐性和真实性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Short videos are an effective tool for promoting contents and improving
knowledge accessibility. While existing extractive video summarization methods
struggle to produce a coherent narrative, existing abstractive methods cannot
`quote' from the input videos, i.e., inserting short video clips in their
outputs. In this work, we explore novel video editing models for generating
shorts that feature a coherent narrative with embedded video insertions
extracted from a long input video. We propose a novel retrieval-embedded
generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal
resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system
first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a
finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to
replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the
narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the
proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short
interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a
documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can
effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative. In
a subjective survey, we show that our proposed method outperforms existing
abstractive and extractive approaches in terms of coherence, alignment, and
realism in teaser generation.

Abstract: We present the Semantics-aware Dataset and Benchmark Generation Pipeline for
Open-vocabulary Object Navigation in Dynamic Scenes (SD-OVON). It utilizes
pretraining multimodal foundation models to generate infinite unique
photo-realistic scene variants that adhere to real-world semantics and daily
commonsense for the training and the evaluation of navigation agents,
accompanied with a plugin for generating object navigation task episodes
compatible to the Habitat simulator. In addition, we offer two pre-generated
object navigation task datasets, SD-OVON-3k and SD-OVON-10k, comprising
respectively about 3k and 10k episodes of the open-vocabulary object navigation
task, derived from the SD-OVON-Scenes dataset with 2.5k photo-realistic scans
of real-world environments and the SD-OVON-Objects dataset with 0.9k manually
inspected scanned and artist-created manipulatable object models. Unlike prior
datasets limited to static environments, SD-OVON covers dynamic scenes and
manipulatable objects, facilitating both real-to-sim and sim-to-real robotic
applications. This approach enhances the realism of navigation tasks, the
training and the evaluation of open-vocabulary object navigation agents in
complex settings. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频模仿中因领域偏移（如光照、颜色或纹理差异）导致的失败问题，避免传统视觉随机化方法的高计算成本和反应性不足。

Method: 将标准RGB视频转换为稀疏的事件表示，编码时间强度梯度，忽略静态外观特征，从而分离运动动态与视觉风格。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和Adroit平台上验证了方法的有效性，实现了对视觉干扰的鲁棒性，无需昂贵的数据增强。

Conclusion: 事件感知方法提供了一种高效且通用的视觉模仿解决方案，适用于存在视觉不匹配的场景。

Abstract: Imitation from videos often fails when expert demonstrations and learner
environments exhibit domain shifts, such as discrepancies in lighting, color,
or texture. While visual randomization partially addresses this problem by
augmenting training data, it remains computationally intensive and inherently
reactive, struggling with unseen scenarios. We propose a different approach:
instead of randomizing appearances, we eliminate their influence entirely by
rethinking the sensory representation itself. Inspired by biological vision
systems that prioritize temporal transients (e.g., retinal ganglion cells) and
by recent sensor advancements, we introduce event-inspired perception for
visually robust imitation. Our method converts standard RGB videos into a
sparse, event-based representation that encodes temporal intensity gradients,
discarding static appearance features. This biologically grounded approach
disentangles motion dynamics from visual style, enabling robust visual
imitation from observations even in the presence of visual mismatches between
expert and agent environments. By training policies on event streams, we
achieve invariance to appearance-based distractors without requiring
computationally expensive and environment-specific data augmentation
techniques. Experiments across the DeepMind Control Suite and the Adroit
platform for dynamic dexterous manipulation show the efficacy of our method.
Our code is publicly available at Eb-LAIfO.

Method: 构建了包含9,262个CT体积和395K专家级问题的DeepTumorVQA基准，测试了四种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 当前模型在测量任务上表现尚可，但在病灶识别和推理方面表现不佳，未能满足临床需求。大规模多模态预训练和图像预处理对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: DeepTumorVQA揭示了视觉语言模型在3D临床诊断中的局限性，并强调了多模态预训练和视觉模块设计的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in various 2D visual tasks,
yet their readiness for 3D clinical diagnosis remains unclear due to stringent
demands for recognition precision, reasoning ability, and domain knowledge. To
systematically evaluate these dimensions, we present DeepTumorVQA, a diagnostic
visual question answering (VQA) benchmark targeting abdominal tumors in CT
scans. It comprises 9,262 CT volumes (3.7M slices) from 17 public datasets,
with 395K expert-level questions spanning four categories: Recognition,
Measurement, Visual Reasoning, and Medical Reasoning. DeepTumorVQA introduces
unique challenges, including small tumor detection and clinical reasoning
across 3D anatomy. Benchmarking four advanced VLMs (RadFM, M3D, Merlin,
CT-CHAT), we find current models perform adequately on measurement tasks but
struggle with lesion recognition and reasoning, and are still not meeting
clinical needs. Two key insights emerge: (1) large-scale multimodal pretraining
plays a crucial role in DeepTumorVQA testing performance, making RadFM stand
out among all VLMs. (2) Our dataset exposes critical differences in VLM
components, where proper image preprocessing and design of vision modules
significantly affect 3D perception. To facilitate medical multimodal research,
we have released DeepTumorVQA as a rigorous benchmark:

Motivation: 现有方法将标签视为平面且独立，忽略了语义层次结构，因此提出利用LLMs自动生成多级语义分类，并引入递归不确定性投影机制。

Method: 通过LLM提示自动生成多级语义分类，结合递归不确定性投影机制，实现空间多样化和标签感知的点选择。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet v2数据集上，标注预算极低（如0.02%）时，mIoU提升高达4%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 展示了LLMs作为3D视觉知识先验的潜力，层次化不确定性建模为高效点云标注提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel active learning framework for 3D point cloud semantic
segmentation that, for the first time, integrates large language models (LLMs)
to construct hierarchical label structures and guide uncertainty-based sample
selection. Unlike prior methods that treat labels as flat and independent, our
approach leverages LLM prompting to automatically generate multi-level semantic
taxonomies and introduces a recursive uncertainty projection mechanism that
propagates uncertainty across hierarchy levels. This enables spatially diverse,
label-aware point selection that respects the inherent semantic structure of 3D
scenes. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet v2 show that our method achieves up to
4% mIoU improvement under extremely low annotation budgets (e.g., 0.02%),
substantially outperforming existing baselines. Our results highlight the
untapped potential of LLMs as knowledge priors in 3D vision and establish
hierarchical uncertainty modeling as a powerful paradigm for efficient point
cloud annotation.

Motivation: 传统文档对齐方法需要原始图像数据，但在隐私或存储受限的情况下不可行。

Result: 在测试文档上，OCR方法比传统图像方法更准确且高效。

Conclusion: 该方法为文档处理提供了更高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少了对高维图像数据的依赖。

Abstract: Document alignment and registration play a crucial role in numerous
real-world applications, such as automated form processing, anomaly detection,
and workflow automation. Traditional methods for document alignment rely on
image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric
transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require
access to the original document images, which may not always be available due
to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel
approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features
for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual
content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without
relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in
scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is
robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies
in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based
approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods,
offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration
tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all
while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.

Motivation: 早期杂草识别对有效管理至关重要，但现有AI模型面临数据不足和形态多样性等挑战，因此开发了WeedNet以解决这些问题。

Method: 采用自监督学习、微调和全局到局部策略，构建端到端实时杂草识别管道。

Result: WeedNet在1,593种杂草中达到91.02%准确率，局部模型在85种爱荷华杂草中达到97.38%准确率。

Conclusion: WeedNet具有广泛适用性和适应性，可作为基础模型，并为农业机器人平台和智能咨询工具提供支持。

Abstract: Early identification of weeds is essential for effective management and
control, and there is growing interest in automating the process using computer
vision techniques coupled with AI methods. However, challenges associated with
training AI-based weed identification models, such as limited expert-verified
data and complexity and variability in morphological features, have hindered
progress. To address these issues, we present WeedNet, the first global-scale
weed identification model capable of recognizing an extensive set of weed
species, including noxious and invasive plant species. WeedNet is an end-to-end
real-time weed identification pipeline and uses self-supervised learning,
fine-tuning, and enhanced trustworthiness strategies. WeedNet achieved 91.02%
accuracy across 1,593 weed species, with 41% species achieving 100% accuracy.
Using a fine-tuning strategy and a Global-to-Local approach, the local Iowa
WeedNet model achieved an overall accuracy of 97.38% for 85 Iowa weeds, most
classes exceeded a 90% mean accuracy per class. Testing across intra-species
dissimilarity (developmental stages) and inter-species similarity (look-alike
species) suggests that diversity in the images collected, spanning all the
growth stages and distinguishable plant characteristics, is crucial in driving
model performance. The generalizability and adaptability of the Global WeedNet
model enable it to function as a foundational model, with the Global-to-Local
strategy allowing fine-tuning for region-specific weed communities. Additional
validation of drone- and ground-rover-based images highlights the potential of
WeedNet for integration into robotic platforms. Furthermore, integration with
AI for conversational use provides intelligent agricultural and ecological
conservation consulting tools for farmers, agronomists, researchers, land
managers, and government agencies across diverse landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视图相机设置，计算成本高；而选择性输入方法虽降低成本，却牺牲了质量，导致视图和时间不一致。

Method: 利用全局几何引导图像渲染流程，通过时间上的颜色差异掩码逐步优化深度图，并使用截断有符号距离场积累深度信息，再通过预训练混合网络融合多视图图像。

Result: 实现了视图和时间一致的高质量视频合成，且能高效在线运行。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效的同时，显著提升了视频视图合成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel geometry-guided online video view synthesis method with
enhanced view and temporal consistency. Traditional approaches achieve
high-quality synthesis from dense multi-view camera setups but require
significant computational resources. In contrast, selective-input methods
reduce this cost but often compromise quality, leading to multi-view and
temporal inconsistencies such as flickering artifacts. Our method addresses
this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with
view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using
global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this,
we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time.
These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields
in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and
temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that
fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is
encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple
views and time. Our approach achieves consistent, high-quality video synthesis,
while running efficiently in an online manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代端到端自动驾驶系统的规划器缺乏时间一致性机制，导致预测误差随时间累积。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入CFC循环机制，通过双向一致性验证轨迹预测的合理性，并结合循环损失函数优化BEV表示。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，L2误差降低0.04米，碰撞率减少0.12%。

Conclusion: Echo Planning为安全关键型自动驾驶系统提供了一种无需额外监督的鲁棒规划方案。

Abstract: Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical
limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency
between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of
self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically
over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that
establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize
trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible
future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated
from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC
mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate
the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and
reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework
intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2
error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners.
Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC
cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable
solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Understanding and synthesizing realistic 3D hand-object interactions (HOI) is
critical for applications ranging from immersive AR/VR to dexterous robotics.
Existing methods struggle with generalization, performing well on closed-set
objects and predefined tasks but failing to handle unseen objects or
open-vocabulary instructions. We introduce OpenHOI, the first framework for
open-world HOI synthesis, capable of generating long-horizon manipulation
sequences for novel objects guided by free-form language commands. Our approach
integrates a 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) fine-tuned for joint
affordance grounding and semantic task decomposition, enabling precise
localization of interaction regions (e.g., handles, buttons) and breakdown of
complex instructions (e.g., "Find a water bottle and take a sip") into
executable sub-tasks. To synthesize physically plausible interactions, we
propose an affordance-driven diffusion model paired with a training-free
physics refinement stage that minimizes penetration and optimizes affordance
alignment. Evaluations across diverse scenarios demonstrate OpenHOI's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to novel object
categories, multi-stage tasks, and complex language instructions. Our project

Result: IAL在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: IAL通过有效融合LiDAR与图像数据，显著提升了3D全景分割的准确性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent
sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately
recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to
overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images,
leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While
these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such
as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing
steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel
multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a
modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment
between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer
decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse
LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a
Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the
complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization
through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's
ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic
segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学分割数据集多为部分标注，限制了模型学习共享解剖结构表示的能力；纯视觉框架难以捕捉复杂解剖关系，导致分割精度和泛化性不足。

Method: 结合CNN与DINOv2提取视觉特征，引入CLIP文本嵌入和多头交叉注意力模块，设计任务特定文本提示生成模块（TTPG）。

Result: 在多个医学影像数据集上，CDPDNet性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CDPDNet通过融合视觉与文本信息，有效解决了部分标注和复杂解剖关系建模问题，提升了分割精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Most publicly available medical segmentation datasets are only partially
labeled, with annotations provided for a subset of anatomical structures. When
multiple datasets are combined for training, this incomplete annotation poses
challenges, as it limits the model's ability to learn shared anatomical
representations among datasets. Furthermore, vision-only frameworks often fail
to capture complex anatomical relationships and task-specific distinctions,
leading to reduced segmentation accuracy and poor generalizability to unseen
datasets. In this study, we proposed a novel CLIP-DINO Prompt-Driven
Segmentation Network (CDPDNet), which combined a self-supervised vision
transformer with CLIP-based text embedding and introduced task-specific text
prompts to tackle these challenges. Specifically, the framework was constructed
upon a convolutional neural network (CNN) and incorporated DINOv2 to extract
both fine-grained and global visual features, which were then fused using a
multi-head cross-attention module to overcome the limited long-range modeling
capability of CNNs. In addition, CLIP-derived text embeddings were projected
into the visual space to help model complex relationships among organs and
tumors. To further address the partial label challenge and enhance inter-task
discriminative capability, a Text-based Task Prompt Generation (TTPG) module
that generated task-specific prompts was designed to guide the segmentation.
Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrated that
CDPDNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art segmentation
methods. Code and pretrained model are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法依赖模型微调且无法保证样本多样性，限制了性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as an effective strategy, significantly
reducing training costs and facilitating more efficient model deployment.
Recent advances have leveraged generative models to distill datasets by
capturing the underlying data distribution. Unfortunately, existing methods
require model fine-tuning with distillation losses to encourage diversity and
representativeness. However, these methods do not guarantee sample diversity,
limiting their performance. We propose a mode-guided diffusion model leveraging
a pre-trained diffusion model without the need to fine-tune with distillation
losses. Our approach addresses dataset diversity in three stages: Mode
Discovery to identify distinct data modes, Mode Guidance to enhance intra-class
diversity, and Stop Guidance to mitigate artifacts in synthetic samples that
affect performance. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving accuracy gains of 4.4%, 2.9%, 1.6%, and 1.6% on ImageNette, ImageIDC,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K, respectively. Our method eliminates the need for
fine-tuning diffusion models with distillation losses, significantly reducing
computational costs. Our code is available on the project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前感知模型在开放环境中对未知对象的检测能力有限，且开放端模型性能较低。

Method: 结合开放集和开放端模型的查询，提出通用和特定查询融合模块，引入排名可学习查询和去噪点训练策略。

Result: 在LVIS数据集上超越现有开放集和开放端方法，尤其在稀有对象上表现突出。

Conclusion: VL-SAM-V2通过融合查询和优化训练策略，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Current perception models have achieved remarkable success by leveraging
large-scale labeled datasets, but still face challenges in open-world
environments with novel objects. To address this limitation, researchers
introduce open-set perception models to detect or segment arbitrary test-time
user-input categories. However, open-set models rely on human involvement to
provide predefined object categories as input during inference. More recently,
researchers have framed a more realistic and challenging task known as
open-ended perception that aims to discover unseen objects without requiring
any category-level input from humans at inference time. Nevertheless,
open-ended models suffer from low performance compared to open-set models. In
this paper, we present VL-SAM-V2, an open-world object detection framework that
is capable of discovering unseen objects while achieving favorable performance.
To achieve this, we combine queries from open-set and open-ended models and
propose a general and specific query fusion module to allow different queries
to interact. By adjusting queries from open-set models, we enable VL-SAM-V2 to
be evaluated in the open-set or open-ended mode. In addition, to learn more
diverse queries, we introduce ranked learnable queries to match queries with
proposals from open-ended models by sorting. Moreover, we design a denoising
point training strategy to facilitate the training process. Experimental
results on LVIS show that our method surpasses the previous open-set and
open-ended methods, especially on rare objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPARS的弱监督语义分割框架，利用图像级二元癌症标签在CT扫描中定位癌症区域，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤分割对癌症诊疗至关重要，但全监督模型需要大量标注且标注主观性强，而组织病理学标签难以获取。SPARS旨在减少对人工标注的依赖。

Method: SPARS结合自博弈对抗强化学习，利用少量图像级二元标签训练分类器，实现癌症区域定位。

Result: 在真实患者数据上，SPARS的平均Dice得分为77.3±9.4，优于其他弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SPARS展示了减少人工标注需求的潜力，适用于实际医疗场景中的癌症检测。

Abstract: Accurate tumour segmentation is vital for various targeted diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures for cancer, e.g., planning biopsies or tumour ablations.
Manual delineation is extremely labour-intensive, requiring substantial expert
time. Fully-supervised machine learning models aim to automate such
localisation tasks, but require a large number of costly and often subjective
3D voxel-level labels for training. The high-variance and subjectivity in such
labels impacts model generalisability, even when large datasets are available.
Histopathology labels may offer more objective labels but the infeasibility of
acquiring pixel-level annotations to develop tumour localisation methods based
on histology remains challenging in-vivo. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework called SPARS (Self-Play
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Segmentation), which utilises an object
presence classifier, trained on a small number of image-level binary cancer
presence labels, to localise cancerous regions on CT scans. Such binary labels
of patient-level cancer presence can be sourced more feasibly from biopsies and
histopathology reports, enabling a more objective cancer localisation on
medical images. Evaluating with real patient data, we observed that SPARS
yielded a mean dice score of $77.3 \pm 9.4$, which outperformed other
weakly-supervised methods by large margins. This performance was comparable
with recent fully-supervised methods that require voxel-level annotations. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using SPARS to reduce the need for
extensive human-annotated labels to detect cancer in real-world healthcare
settings.

*Hancong Jin,Zihan Cao,Liangjian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KSDiff的新方法，通过在潜在空间中利用扩散过程生成卷积核，以提升全色锐化质量并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以捕捉遥感数据的全局先验，而扩散模型虽有效但推理延迟高。

Method: KSDiff结合低秩核心张量生成器和统一因子生成器，通过结构感知多头注意力机制生成卷积核。

Result: 在WorldView-3、GaoFen-2和QuickBird数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: KSDiff是一种高效的全色锐化框架，可提升现有方法性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening is a fundamental task in remote sensing that integrates
high-resolution panchromatic imagery (PAN) with low-resolution multispectral
imagery (LRMS) to produce an enhanced image with both high spatial and spectral
resolution. Despite significant progress in deep learning-based approaches,
existing methods often fail to capture the global priors inherent in remote
sensing data distributions. Diffusion-based models have recently emerged as
promising solutions due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities;
however, they suffer from significant inference latency, which limits their
practical applicability. In this work, we propose the Kernel Space Diffusion
Model (KSDiff), a novel approach that leverages diffusion processes in a latent
space to generate convolutional kernels enriched with global contextual
information, thereby improving pansharpening quality while enabling faster
inference. Specifically, KSDiff constructs these kernels through the
integration of a low-rank core tensor generator and a unified factor generator,
orchestrated by a structure-aware multi-head attention mechanism. We further
introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for pansharpening, enabling
KSDiff to serve as a framework for enhancing existing pansharpening
architectures. Experiments on three widely used datasets, including
WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superior performance of
KSDiff both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released upon
possible acceptance.

Conclusion: VPGS-SLAM是首个适用于大规模场景的3DGS-based SLAM框架，具有高效性和鲁棒性，代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results in dense visual
SLAM. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM methods are all constrained to
small-room scenarios and struggle with memory explosion in large-scale scenes
and long sequences. To this end, we propose VPGS-SLAM, the first 3DGS-based
large-scale RGBD SLAM framework for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. We
design a novel voxel-based progressive 3D Gaussian mapping method with multiple
submaps for compact and accurate scene representation in large-scale and
long-sequence scenes. This allows us to scale up to arbitrary scenes and
improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In addition, we propose a 2D-3D
fusion camera tracking method to achieve robust and accurate camera tracking in
both indoor and outdoor large-scale scenes. Furthermore, we design a 2D-3D
Gaussian loop closure method to eliminate pose drift. We further propose a
submap fusion method with online distillation to achieve global consistency in
large-scale scenes when detecting a loop. Experiments on various indoor and
outdoor datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the
proposed framework. The code will be open source on
https://github.com/dtc111111/vpgs-slam.

Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法在跨模态交互和静态融合策略上存在不足，未能充分利用不同模态的互补性。

Method: 采用双路径编码、共注意力机制和维度门控网络，结合专家融合模块生成统一表示。

Result: 在MIMIC和SemEval Memotion 1.0数据集上实现了跨模态对齐和性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态应用中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has become a critical research area because integrating
text and image data can significantly improve performance in tasks such as
classification, retrieval, and scene understanding. However, despite progress
with pre-trained models, current approaches are limited by inadequate
cross-modal interactions and static fusion strategies that do not fully exploit
the complementary nature of different modalities. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that
leverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and
advanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image
features into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention
mechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.
This mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that
adaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring
that only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path
encoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information
separately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns
modalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion
module that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,
unified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval
Memotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements
in cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the
potential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Motivation: 现有空间关系推理基准存在依赖边界框、忽略视角替换或仅依赖先验知识等问题，限制了模型对客观世界的理解。

Method: 设计了精心定制的标注流程，构建了包含5,392个样本的SpatialMQA基准，并测试了一系列开源和闭源MLLMs。

Result: 当前最先进的MLLM准确率仅为48.14%，远低于人类水平的98.40%。

Conclusion: SpatialMQA为未来研究提供了方向，基准和代码已开源。

Abstract: Spatial relation reasoning is a crucial task for multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to understand the objective world. However, current benchmarks
have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions,
or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge
without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA,
a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which
enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To
ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting
in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of
closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the
current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the
human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also
conducted, suggesting the future research directions. The benchmark and codes
are available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/SpatialMQA.git.

Result: 通过实验比较了十种最先进的VAD方法，验证了新评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新评估方法为未来VAD模型开发提供了新视角，解决了现有评估的局限性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate
from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing
advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training
strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and
benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through
comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in
current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single
annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of
anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene
overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation
methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round
annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a
Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate
anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks
(UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene
overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD
approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives
for future VAD model development.

Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and
has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized
the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to
support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare
system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using
advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main
components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using
transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the
most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox),
the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16
achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%.
For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox
and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox,
and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1
scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most
lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The
second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users
to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive
recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The
third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health
authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends,
guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure
within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public
health management.

TL;DR: 论文提出了InfoChartQA基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在信息图表理解上的表现，填补了现有视觉问答基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对信息图表中设计驱动视觉元素（如图标、象形图）的评估能力，无法全面测试MLLMs的视觉识别与推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含5,642对信息图表与普通图表的数据集，设计基于视觉元素的问题，评估20种MLLMs的表现。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在信息图表上的性能显著下降，尤其在涉及隐喻的视觉元素问题上。

Conclusion: InfoChartQA为MLLMs在信息图表理解上的改进提供了新机会，并支持细粒度错误分析与消融研究。

Abstract: Understanding infographic charts with design-driven visual elements (e.g.,
pictograms, icons) requires both visual recognition and reasoning, posing
challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing
visual-question answering benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
capabilities of MLLMs due to the lack of paired plain charts and
visual-element-based questions. To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes
5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying
data but differing in visual presentations. We further design
visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and
communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance
decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions
related to metaphors. The paired infographic and plain charts enable
fine-grained error analysis and ablation studies, which highlight new
opportunities for advancing MLLMs in infographic chart understanding. We
release InfoChartQA at https://github.com/CoolDawnAnt/InfoChartQA.

TL;DR: 医学大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多图像临床场景中的能力尚未充分探索。研究者提出了Med-MIM指令数据集，并基于此微调了两个模型MIM-LLaVA-Med和Med-Mantis，显著提升了多图像理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学LVLMs在多图像任务（如时间推理和跨模态分析）中表现不足，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含83.2K多图像问答对的Med-MIM数据集，并微调了Mantis和LLaVA-Med模型。

Result: MIM-LLaVA-Med和Med-Mantis在Med-MIM基准测试中表现优异，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: Med-MIM数据集和微调模型显著提升了医学LVLMs的多图像理解能力。

Abstract: Medical large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising
performance across various single-image question answering (QA) benchmarks, yet
their capability in processing multi-image clinical scenarios remains
underexplored. Unlike single image based tasks, medical tasks involving
multiple images often demand sophisticated visual understanding capabilities,
such as temporal reasoning and cross-modal analysis, which are poorly supported
by current medical LVLMs. To bridge this critical gap, we present the Med-MIM
instruction dataset, comprising 83.2K medical multi-image QA pairs that span
four types of multi-image visual abilities (temporal understanding, reasoning,
comparison, co-reference). Using this dataset, we fine-tune Mantis and
LLaVA-Med, resulting in two specialized medical VLMs: MIM-LLaVA-Med and
Med-Mantis, both optimized for multi-image analysis. Additionally, we develop
the Med-MIM benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the medical multi-image
understanding capabilities of LVLMs. We assess eight popular LVLMs, including
our two models, on the Med-MIM benchmark. Experimental results show that both
Med-Mantis and MIM-LLaVA-Med achieve superior performance on the held-in and
held-out subsets of the Med-MIM benchmark, demonstrating that the Med-MIM
instruction dataset effectively enhances LVLMs' multi-image understanding
capabilities in the medical domain.

Abstract: In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the learning of 3D
human representation. However, the complexity of lots of hand-defined human
body constraints and the absence of supervision data limit that the existing
works controllably and accurately represent the human body in views of
semantics and representation ability. In this paper, we propose a human body
representation with controllable fine-grained semantics and high precison of
reconstruction in an unsupervised learning framework. In particularly, we
design a whole-aware skeleton-grouped disentangle strategy to learn a
correspondence between geometric semantical measurement of body and latent
codes, which facilitates the control of shape and posture of human body by
modifying latent coding paramerers. With the help of skeleton-grouped
whole-aware encoder and unsupervised disentanglement losses, our representation
model is learned by an unsupervised manner. Besides, a based-template residual
learning scheme is injected into the encoder to ease of learning human body
latent parameter in complicated body shape and pose spaces. Because of the
geometrically meaningful latent codes, it can be used in a wide range of
applications, from human body pose transfer to bilinear latent code
interpolation. Further more, a part-aware decoder is utlized to promote the
learning of controllable fine-grained semantics. The experimental results on
public 3D human datasets show that the method has the ability of precise
reconstruction.

Motivation: 探讨解码器深度对点云重建性能的影响，发现过深会导致过拟合，提出多头部架构以利用点云冗余性。

Method: 设计多头部解码器，每个头部独立处理点云子集，最终拼接预测结果以提高多样性和保真度。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart上实验，CD、HD、EMD和F1-score等指标均优于单头部基线。

Conclusion: 点云重建中，输出多样性和架构设计比单纯增加深度更关键。

Abstract: We challenge the common assumption that deeper decoder architectures always
yield better performance in point cloud reconstruction. Our analysis reveals
that, beyond a certain depth, increasing decoder complexity leads to
overfitting and degraded generalization. Additionally, we propose a novel
multi-head decoder architecture that exploits the inherent redundancy in point
clouds by reconstructing complete shapes from multiple independent heads, each
operating on a distinct subset of points. The final output is obtained by
concatenating the predictions from all heads, enhancing both diversity and
fidelity. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart demonstrate that
our approach achieves consistent improvements across key metrics--including
Chamfer Distance (CD), Hausdorff Distance (HD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD),
and F1-score--outperforming standard single-head baselines. Our findings
highlight that output diversity and architectural design can be more critical
than depth alone for effective and efficient point cloud reconstruction.

Conclusion: OmniPainter是一种高效且无需额外优化的风格化图像生成方法。

Abstract: Although diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities,
existing methods for stylized image generation based on these models often
require textual inversion or fine-tuning with style images, which is
time-consuming and limits the practical applicability of large-scale diffusion
models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized image
generation method leveraging a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model without
requiring fine-tuning or any additional optimization, termed as OmniPainter.
Specifically, we exploit the self-consistency property of latent consistency
models to extract the representative style statistics from reference style
images to guide the stylization process. Additionally, we then introduce the
norm mixture of self-attention, which enables the model to query the most
relevant style patterns from these statistics for the intermediate output
content features. This mechanism also ensures that the stylized results align
closely with the distribution of the reference style images. Our qualitative
and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

*Jiashuo Chang,Zhengyi Li,Jianxun Lou,Zhen Qiu,Hanhe Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的宏摄影图像质量评估（MPIQA）数据库MMP-2k，填补了该领域数据不足的空白，并发现现有通用IQA指标在宏摄影图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宏摄影（MP）在科学研究和医学等领域有重要应用，但缺乏专门的图像质量评估（MPIQA）数据，限制了MPIQA指标的发展。

Method: 从三个公共图像网站收集15,700张宏摄影图像，筛选出2,000张构建MMP-2k数据库，并通过实验室研究获取每张图像的17个质量评分及详细的失真报告。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有的通用IQA指标在宏摄影图像上表现不佳。

Conclusion: MMP-2k数据库为MPIQA研究提供了重要资源，未来可基于此开发更准确的MPIQA指标。

Abstract: Macro photography (MP) is a specialized field of photography that captures
objects at an extremely close range, revealing tiny details. Although an
accurate macro photography image quality assessment (MPIQA) metric can benefit
macro photograph capturing, which is vital in some domains such as scientific
research and medical applications, the lack of MPIQA data limits the
development of MPIQA metrics. To address this limitation, we conducted a
large-scale MPIQA study. Specifically, to ensure diversity both in content and
quality, we sampled 2,000 MP images from 15,700 MP images, collected from three
public image websites. For each MP image, 17 (out of 21 after outlier removal)
quality ratings and a detailed quality report of distortion magnitudes, types,
and positions are gathered by a lab study. The images, quality ratings, and
quality reports form our novel multi-labeled MPIQA database, MMP-2k.
Experimental results showed that the state-of-the-art generic IQA metrics
underperform on MP images. The database and supplementary materials are
available at https://github.com/Future-IQA/MMP-2k.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartSketcher是一种多模态反馈驱动的逐步推理方法，通过视觉标注和迭代反馈提升图表理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在图表理解中因缺乏视觉交互能力而难以纠正错误推理。

Method: 采用Sketch-CoT技术，通过程序化草图库标注中间推理步骤，并结合两阶段训练策略（冷启动和强化学习）。

Result: 在图表理解和通用视觉任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: ChartSketcher提供了一种交互式和可解释的图表理解方法。

Abstract: Charts are high-density visualization carriers for complex data, serving as a
crucial medium for information extraction and analysis. Automated chart
understanding poses significant challenges to existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) due to the need for precise and complex visual
reasoning. Current step-by-step reasoning models primarily focus on text-based
logical reasoning for chart understanding. However, they struggle to refine or
correct their reasoning when errors stem from flawed visual understanding, as
they lack the ability to leverage multimodal interaction for deeper
comprehension. Inspired by human cognitive behavior, we propose ChartSketcher,
a multimodal feedback-driven step-by-step reasoning method designed to address
these limitations. ChartSketcher is a chart understanding model that employs
Sketch-CoT, enabling MLLMs to annotate intermediate reasoning steps directly
onto charts using a programmatic sketching library, iteratively feeding these
visual annotations back into the reasoning process. This mechanism enables the
model to visually ground its reasoning and refine its understanding over
multiple steps. We employ a two-stage training strategy: a cold start phase to
learn sketch-based reasoning patterns, followed by off-policy reinforcement
learning to enhance reflection and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that
ChartSketcher achieves promising performance on chart understanding benchmarks
and general vision tasks, providing an interactive and interpretable approach
to chart comprehension.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动防御人脸交换攻击的方法，通过在面部轮廓嵌入混合水印（CMark），无需预先存储大量信息或依赖特定交换技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的进步，人脸交换的真实性难以区分，传统检测方法面临挑战，因此需要一种主动防御手段。

Method: 研究聚焦于面部轮廓区域，嵌入包含纹理和身份信息的混合水印（CMark），实现渐进式图像判定。

Result: 在8种人脸交换技术上的实验表明，该方法优于现有被动和主动检测器，同时平衡了图像质量与水印鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CMark方法无需依赖特定交换技术，实现了对人脸交换的通用检测，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face swapping, recognized as a privacy and security concern, has prompted
considerable defensive research. With the advancements in AI-generated content,
the discrepancies between the real and swapped faces have become nuanced.
Considering the difficulty of forged traces detection, we shift the focus to
the face swapping purpose and proactively embed elaborate watermarks against
unknown face swapping techniques. Given that the constant purpose is to swap
the original face identity while preserving the background, we concentrate on
the regions surrounding the face to ensure robust watermark generation, while
embedding the contour texture and face identity information to achieve
progressive image determination. The watermark is located in the facial contour
and contains hybrid messages, dubbed the contour-hybrid watermark (CMark). Our
approach generalizes face swapping detection without requiring any swapping
techniques during training and the storage of large-scale messages in advance.
Experiments conducted across 8 face swapping techniques demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared with state-of-the-art passive and
proactive detectors while achieving a favorable balance between the image
quality and watermark robustness.

TL;DR: Jodi是一个统一的扩散框架，通过联合建模图像和多个标签域，将视觉生成与理解任务结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视觉生成与理解视为独立任务，而Jodi旨在统一这两者，提升机器学习的多任务能力。

Method: 基于线性扩散变换器和角色切换机制，支持联合生成、可控生成和图像感知任务。

Result: Jodi在生成和理解任务中表现优异，并展示了强大的扩展性。

Conclusion: Jodi为视觉生成与理解的统一提供了有效框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual generation and understanding are two deeply interconnected aspects of
human intelligence, yet they have been traditionally treated as separate tasks
in machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jodi, a diffusion framework that
unifies visual generation and understanding by jointly modeling the image
domain and multiple label domains. Specifically, Jodi is built upon a linear
diffusion transformer along with a role switch mechanism, which enables it to
perform three particular types of tasks: (1) joint generation, where the model
simultaneously generates images and multiple labels; (2) controllable
generation, where images are generated conditioned on any combination of
labels; and (3) image perception, where multiple labels can be predicted at
once from a given image. Furthermore, we present the Joint-1.6M dataset, which
contains 200,000 high-quality images collected from public sources, automatic
labels for 7 visual domains, and LLM-generated captions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Jodi excels in both generation and understanding tasks and
exhibits strong extensibility to a wider range of visual domains. Code is

*Xuejie Liu,Anji Liu,Guy Van den Broeck,Yitao Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCAP是一种加速掩码生成模型（MGMs）推理的模块，通过重用上下文特征减少计算量，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MGMs生成高质量样本需要多次迭代解码，计算成本高。直接减少步骤会损失生成保真度。

Method: 提出ReCAP模块，通过重用已解码上下文特征构建低成本步骤，交替使用完整评估和轻量步骤。

Result: 在ImageNet256上，ReCAP实现2.4倍加速，性能损失极小，效率-保真度权衡更优。

Conclusion: ReCAP是高效且通用的MGMs加速方案，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Masked generative models (MGMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for
image synthesis, combining parallel decoding with strong bidirectional context
modeling. However, generating high-quality samples typically requires many
iterative decoding steps, resulting in high inference costs. A straightforward
way to speed up generation is by decoding more tokens in each step, thereby
reducing the total number of steps. However, when many tokens are decoded
simultaneously, the model can only estimate the univariate marginal
distributions independently, failing to capture the dependency among them. As a
result, reducing the number of steps significantly compromises generation
fidelity. In this work, we introduce ReCAP (Reused Context-Aware Prediction), a
plug-and-play module that accelerates inference in MGMs by constructing
low-cost steps via reusing feature embeddings from previously decoded context
tokens. ReCAP interleaves standard full evaluations with lightweight steps that
cache and reuse context features, substantially reducing computation while
preserving the benefits of fine-grained, iterative generation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness on top of three representative MGMs (MaskGIT, MAGE, and MAR),
including both discrete and continuous token spaces and covering diverse
architectural designs. In particular, on ImageNet256 class-conditional
generation, ReCAP achieves up to 2.4x faster inference than the base model with
minimal performance drop, and consistently delivers better efficiency-fidelity
trade-offs under various generation settings.

TL;DR: SATORI通过将VQA任务分解为三个阶段（全局图像描述、区域定位和答案预测），解决了R1-like自由推理在VQA任务中的视觉焦点扩散和计算成本问题，并在多个基准测试中提升了15.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态任务与文本任务本质不同，自由推理在VQA任务中会导致视觉焦点扩散和计算成本增加，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: SATORI将VQA任务分解为三个可验证阶段（全局图像描述、区域定位和答案预测），并引入VQA-Verify数据集支持训练。

Result: 在七个VQA基准测试中，SATORI比R1-like基线提升了15.7%的准确率，并增强了关键区域的视觉焦点。

Conclusion: SATORI通过分阶段任务优化和显式奖励信号，显著提升了VQA任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated powerful reasoning capabilities in the text
domain through stable reinforcement learning (RL). Recently, in the multimodal
domain, works have begun to directly apply RL to generate R1-like free-form
reasoning for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. However, multimodal tasks
share an intrinsically different nature from textual tasks, which heavily rely
on the understanding of the input image to solve the problem. Therefore, such
free-form reasoning faces two critical limitations in the VQA task: (1)
Extended reasoning chains diffuse visual focus away from task-critical regions,
degrading answer accuracy. (2) Unverifiable intermediate steps amplify
policy-gradient variance and computational costs overhead. To address these
issues, in this paper, we introduce SATORI ($\textbf{S}patially$
$\textbf{A}nchored$ $\textbf{T}ask$ $\textbf{O}ptimization$ with
$\textbf{R}e\textbf{I}nforcement$ Learning), which decomposes VQA into three
verifiable stages, including global image captioning, region localization, and
answer prediction, each supplying explicit reward signals. Furthermore, we also
introduce VQA-Verify, a 12k dataset annotated with answer-aligned captions and
bounding-boxes to facilitate training. Experiments demonstrate consistent
performance improvements across seven VQA benchmarks, achieving up to $15.7\%$
improvement in accuracy in accuracy compared to the R1-like baseline. Our
analysis of the attention map confirms enhanced focus on critical regions,
which brings improvements in accuracy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的2D表示方法在性能和可解释性上优于传统方法，为DTI数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography offers detailed insights into the
structural connectivity of the brain, but presents challenges in effective
representation and interpretation in deep learning models. In this work, we
propose a novel 2D representation of DTI tractography that encodes tract-level
fractional anisotropy (FA) values into a 9x9 grayscale image. This
representation is processed through a Beta-Total Correlation Variational
Autoencoder with a Spatial Broadcast Decoder to learn a disentangled and
interpretable latent embedding. We evaluate the quality of this embedding using
supervised and unsupervised representation learning strategies, including
auxiliary classification, triplet loss, and SimCLR-based contrastive learning.
Compared to the 1D Group deep neural network (DNN) baselines, our approach
improves the F1 score in a downstream sex classification task by 15.74% and
shows a better disentanglement than the 3D representation.

Result: 在RSOD和AID数据集上，参数减少6.24倍，Top-1准确率接近高参数VGG-16模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在模型大小和分类性能间取得平衡，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing
remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on
resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification
method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as
the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters
and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled
knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and
non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental
results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the
high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent
Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This
approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification
performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited
devices.

Conclusion: CreatiDesign通过系统化解决方案提升了自动化图形设计的灵活性和精确性。

Abstract: Graphic design plays a vital role in visual communication across advertising,
marketing, and multimedia entertainment. Prior work has explored automated
graphic design generation using diffusion models, aiming to streamline creative
workflows and democratize design capabilities. However, complex graphic design
scenarios require accurately adhering to design intent specified by multiple
heterogeneous user-provided elements (\eg images, layouts, and texts), which
pose multi-condition control challenges for existing methods. Specifically,
previous single-condition control models demonstrate effectiveness only within
their specialized domains but fail to generalize to other conditions, while
existing multi-condition methods often lack fine-grained control over each
sub-condition and compromise overall compositional harmony. To address these
limitations, we introduce CreatiDesign, a systematic solution for automated
graphic design covering both model architecture and dataset construction.
First, we design a unified multi-condition driven architecture that enables
flexible and precise integration of heterogeneous design elements with minimal
architectural modifications to the base diffusion model. Furthermore, to ensure
that each condition precisely controls its designated image region and to avoid
interference between conditions, we propose a multimodal attention mask
mechanism. Additionally, we develop a fully automated pipeline for constructing
graphic design datasets, and introduce a new dataset with 400K samples
featuring multi-condition annotations, along with a comprehensive benchmark.
Experimental results show that CreatiDesign outperforms existing models by a
clear margin in faithfully adhering to user intent.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效分离摩尔纹中的纹理损坏和颜色失真，而基于小波的频率感知方法潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出Freqformer框架，通过频率分解将摩尔纹分为高频纹理和低频颜色失真，采用双分支处理，并引入频率组合变换模块（FCT）和空间感知通道注意力模块（SA-CA）。

Result: 在多个去摩尔纹基准测试中，Freqformer以紧凑的模型尺寸实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Freqformer通过频率分离和自适应融合，显著提升了图像去摩尔纹的效果，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Image demoir\'eing remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay
between texture corruption and color distortions caused by moir\'e patterns.
Existing methods, especially those relying on direct image-to-image
restoration, often fail to disentangle these intertwined artifacts effectively.
While wavelet-based frequency-aware approaches offer a promising direction,
their potential remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Freqformer, a
Transformer-based framework specifically designed for image demoir\'eing
through targeted frequency separation. Our method performs an effective
frequency decomposition that explicitly splits moir\'e patterns into
high-frequency spatially-localized textures and low-frequency scale-robust
color distortions, which are then handled by a dual-branch architecture
tailored to their distinct characteristics. We further propose a learnable
Frequency Composition Transform (FCT) module to adaptively fuse the
frequency-specific outputs, enabling consistent and high-fidelity
reconstruction. To better aggregate the spatial dependencies and the
inter-channel complementary information, we introduce a Spatial-Aware Channel
Attention (SA-CA) module that refines moir\'e-sensitive regions without
incurring high computational cost. Extensive experiments on various
demoir\'eing benchmarks demonstrate that Freqformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance with a compact model size. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 研究为条件策略和幅度控制提供了新见解，并公开了方法实现。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but
remain challenging to train due to their inherent stochasticity, where
high-variance gradient estimates lead to slow convergence. Previous works have
shown that magnitude preservation helps with stabilizing training in the U-net
architecture. This work explores whether this effect extends to the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) architecture. As such, we propose a magnitude-preserving
design that stabilizes training without normalization layers. Motivated by the
goal of maintaining activation magnitudes, we additionally introduce rotation
modulation, which is a novel conditioning method using learned rotations
instead of traditional scaling or shifting. Through empirical evaluations and
ablation studies on small-scale models, we show that magnitude-preserving
strategies significantly improve performance, notably reducing FID scores by
$\sim$12.8%. Further, we show that rotation modulation combined with scaling is
competitive with AdaLN, while requiring $\sim$5.4% fewer parameters. This work
provides insights into conditioning strategies and magnitude control. We will
publicly release the implementation of our method.

Conclusion: RTime-QA是一个有效的基准测试，能评估LMMs的时间理解能力，而RTime-IT能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Understanding accurate atomic temporal event is essential for video
comprehension. However, current video-language benchmarks often fall short to
evaluate Large Multi-modal Models' (LMMs) temporal event understanding
capabilities, as they can be effectively addressed using image-language models.
In this paper, we introduce RTime-QA, a novel benchmark specifically designed
to assess the atomic temporal event understanding ability of LMMs. RTime-QA
comprises 822 high-quality, carefully-curated video-text questions, each
meticulously annotated by human experts. Each question features a video
depicting an atomic temporal event, paired with both correct answers and
temporal negative descriptions, specifically designed to evaluate temporal
understanding. To advance LMMs' temporal event understanding ability, we
further introduce RTime-IT, a 14k instruction-tuning dataset that employs a
similar annotation process as RTime-QA. Extensive experimental analysis
demonstrates that RTime-QA presents a significant challenge for LMMs: the
state-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL achieves only 34.6 on strict-ACC metric,
substantially lagging behind human performance. Furthermore, our experiments
reveal that RTime-IT effectively enhance LMMs' capacity in temporal
understanding. By fine-tuning on RTime-IT, our Qwen2-VL achieves 65.9 on
RTime-QA.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based on Thermal Infrared (TIR)
imaging has gained attention in novel-view synthesis, showing real-time
rendering. However, novel-view synthesis with thermal infrared images suffers
from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters
and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce
Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal
Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and
maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field
that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal
variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and
MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain
robustness. Extensive experiments on the TI-NSD benchmark show that our method
achieves better performance over existing methods.

Motivation: 现代应用可轻松访问用户相册，而多图像关系分析加剧了隐私风险。现有研究缺乏多图像标注的基准数据集，且多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在抽象属性推断上能力有限。

Method: 构建PAPI数据集（2510张图像，251人，3012个隐私属性标注），提出HolmesEye框架，结合VLM提取图像内和图像间信息，利用LLM引导推断并整合结果。

Result: HolmesEye在平均准确率上比现有基线提升10.8%，在抽象属性预测上超越人类表现15.0%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图像隐私分析的紧迫性，提供了新数据集和框架，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Our research reveals a new privacy risk associated with the vision-language
model (VLM) agentic framework: the ability to infer sensitive attributes (e.g.,
age and health information) and even abstract ones (e.g., personality and
social traits) from a set of personal images, which we term "image private
attribute profiling." This threat is particularly severe given that modern apps
can easily access users' photo albums, and inference from image sets enables
models to exploit inter-image relations for more sophisticated profiling.
However, two main challenges hinder our understanding of how well VLMs can
profile an individual from a few personal photos: (1) the lack of benchmark
datasets with multi-image annotations for private attributes, and (2) the
limited ability of current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to infer
abstract attributes from large image collections. In this work, we construct
PAPI, the largest dataset for studying private attribute profiling in personal
images, comprising 2,510 images from 251 individuals with 3,012 annotated
privacy attributes. We also propose HolmesEye, a hybrid agentic framework that
combines VLMs and LLMs to enhance privacy inference. HolmesEye uses VLMs to
extract both intra-image and inter-image information and LLMs to guide the
inference process as well as consolidate the results through forensic analysis,
overcoming existing limitations in long-context visual reasoning. Experiments
reveal that HolmesEye achieves a 10.8% improvement in average accuracy over
state-of-the-art baselines and surpasses human-level performance by 15.0% in
predicting abstract attributes. This work highlights the urgency of addressing
privacy risks in image-based profiling and offers both a new dataset and an
advanced framework to guide future research in this area.

TL;DR: 提出DISTA-Net模型，解决红外成像中密集小目标重叠信号的分离问题，并建立首个开源生态系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像中密集小目标信号重叠导致数量、位置和辐射强度难以精确测定，且现有深度学习方法未涉及此类问题。

Method: 提出动态迭代收缩阈值网络（DISTA-Net），实时生成卷积权重和阈值参数，优化重建过程。

Result: DISTA-Net在亚像素检测精度上表现优异，并建立了包含数据集、评估指标和工具包的开源生态系统。

Conclusion: DISTA-Net是首个针对密集红外小目标分离的深度学习模型，开源生态系统将推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Resolving closely-spaced small targets in dense clusters presents a
significant challenge in infrared imaging, as the overlapping signals hinder
precise determination of their quantity, sub-pixel positions, and radiation
intensities. While deep learning has advanced the field of infrared small
target detection, its application to closely-spaced infrared small targets has
not yet been explored. This gap exists primarily due to the complexity of
separating superimposed characteristics and the lack of an open-source
infrastructure. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Iterative Shrinkage
Thresholding Network (DISTA-Net), which reconceptualizes traditional sparse
reconstruction within a dynamic framework. DISTA-Net adaptively generates
convolution weights and thresholding parameters to tailor the reconstruction
process in real time. To the best of our knowledge, DISTA-Net is the first deep
learning model designed specifically for the unmixing of closely-spaced
infrared small targets, achieving superior sub-pixel detection accuracy.
Moreover, we have established the first open-source ecosystem to foster further
research in this field. This ecosystem comprises three key components: (1)
CSIST-100K, a publicly available benchmark dataset; (2) CSO-mAP, a custom
evaluation metric for sub-pixel detection; and (3) GrokCSO, an open-source
toolkit featuring DISTA-Net and other models. Our code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/GrokCV/GrokCSO.

TL;DR: MIND-Edit提出了一种结合多模态大语言模型（MLLM）和扩散模型的端到端图像编辑框架，通过优化文本指令和利用MLLM的视觉理解能力，显著提升了复杂场景下的编辑精度和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在复杂场景中难以实现高精度和语义准确性，且MLLM的视觉理解能力未被充分挖掘。

Method: MIND-Edit结合两种策略：文本指令优化和MLLM驱动的视觉嵌入生成，并通过联合训练整合这两种策略。

Result: 实验表明，MIND-Edit在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: MIND-Edit通过整合MLLM的视觉理解能力，显著提升了图像编辑的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and
fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods
still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in
complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However,
current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions,
leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored,
thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual
outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end
image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM.
MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction
optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on
semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing
strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding
capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process
via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training
approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce
each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent
edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both
quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and
challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS方法在渲染效率上表现优异，但无法解决高斯基元颜色表示的各向异性与语义特征各向同性需求之间的矛盾，导致跨视角特征一致性不足。

Method: 提出FHGS框架，包括通用特征融合架构、非可微特征融合机制和双驱动优化策略，结合预训练模型特征与3D场景映射。

Conclusion: FHGS通过物理模型启发的方法，平衡了渲染效率与特征一致性，为3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently
achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient
rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between
the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic
requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature
consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\textit{FHGS}$
(Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework
inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of
arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the
real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\textit{FHGS}$
introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion
architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained
models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures.
Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which
enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic
distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of
gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a
dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is
proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with
internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic
optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sparse-to-Dense (StD)的解码策略，通过结合稀疏和密集注意力模块，加速视频大语言模型的推理，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型的推理延迟随输入序列长度增加而增加，影响长视频序列的高效处理。

Method: StD策略包含稀疏top-K注意力和密集全注意力模块，前者快速解码多个token，后者并行验证。

Result: StD实现了1.94倍的加速，且无需调参或大量代码修改。

Conclusion: StD是一种高效、即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了视频处理的效率。

Abstract: Due to the auto-regressive nature of current video large language models
(Video-LLMs), the inference latency increases as the input sequence length
grows, posing challenges for the efficient processing of video sequences that
are usually very long. We observe that during decoding, the attention scores of
most tokens in Video-LLMs tend to be sparse and concentrated, with only certain
tokens requiring comprehensive full attention. Based on this insight, we
introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two
distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing
dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs
without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens,
while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free,
plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94$\times$ walltime speedup in
video processing. It maintains model performance while enabling a seamless
transition from a standard Video-LLM to a sparse Video-LLM with minimal code
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合学习框架，通过特征重建和预测任务处理卫星图像时间序列中的缺失数据，显著提升了农业语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云污染导致卫星图像时间序列（SITS）中存在时间间隙，破坏时间依赖性并引发特征偏移，现有方法（如全序列重建或数据增强）存在噪声、冗余或泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出联合学习框架，结合特征重建和预测任务，利用时间掩码模拟数据缺失场景，并通过完整SITS训练的教师模型指导任务。

Result: 在湖南、法国西部和加泰罗尼亚的SITS实验中，方法在农田提取和作物分类中的平均F1分数分别提升了6.93%和7.09%，且对不同卫星传感器和缺失率具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性重建关键特征并整合至预测任务，有效减少了噪声传播，提升了模型对缺失数据的处理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for agricultural semantic
segmentation. However, Cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS,
disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, leading to
degraded performance of models trained on complete SITS. Existing methods
typically address this by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or
using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may
introduce noise and redundancy, while the data-augmented model can only handle
limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint
learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address
incomplete SITS more effectively. During training, we simulate data-missing
scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth
labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task
constrains the model from selectively reconstructing critical features from
masked inputs that align with the teacher's temporal feature representations.
It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By
integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids
learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns
and complete SITS. Experiments on SITS from Hunan Province, Western France, and
Catalonia show that our method improves mean F1-scores by 6.93% in cropland
extraction and 7.09% in crop classification over baselines. It also generalizes
well across satellite sensors, including Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, under
varying temporal missing rates and model backbones.

Conclusion: 研究为智能手术图像恢复算法发展提供基础，有望提升手术环境质量和临床效率。

Abstract: In laparoscopic surgery, a clear and high-quality visual field is critical
for surgeons to make accurate intraoperative decisions. However, persistent
visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging
from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid
splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These
degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient
safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical
scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image
restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which
involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and
desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types
and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a
standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative
generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10
task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal
substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a
critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical
restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between
surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic
understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific
image restoration research. Our work aims to empower the capabilities of
restoration algorithms to increase surgical environments and improve the
efficiency of clinical procedures.

offering a principled benchmark for compositional alignment under test-time
conditions. We will publicly release the implementation of our method.

Motivation: 传统RGB或深度相机在低光环境和运动模糊下表现不佳，事件相机因其高动态范围和高时间分辨率成为替代方案，但现有研究受限于静态背景和固定相机。

Method: 引入手部分割模块（Hand Segmentation Module）提取手部区域，减少动态背景事件的影响。

Result: 在N-HOT3D数据集上评估，MPJPE提升了约4.5厘米（43%）。

Conclusion: EventEgoHands在动态背景下有效提升了3D手部网格重建的精度。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D hand mesh is challenging but an important task for
human-computer interaction and AR/VR applications. In particular, RGB and/or
depth cameras have been widely used in this task. However, methods using these
conventional cameras face challenges in low-light environments and during
motion blur. Thus, to address these limitations, event cameras have been
attracting attention in recent years for their high dynamic range and high
temporal resolution. Despite their advantages, event cameras are sensitive to
background noise or camera motion, which has limited existing studies to static
backgrounds and fixed cameras. In this study, we propose EventEgoHands, a novel
method for event-based 3D hand mesh reconstruction in an egocentric view. Our
approach introduces a Hand Segmentation Module that extracts hand regions,
effectively mitigating the influence of dynamic background events. We evaluated
our approach and demonstrated its effectiveness on the N-HOT3D dataset,
improving MPJPE by approximately more than 4.5 cm (43%).

Abstract: The field of computer graphics was revolutionized by models such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, displacing triangles as the dominant
representation for photogrammetry. In this paper, we argue for a triangle
comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes
triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle
as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the
adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared
to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher
visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the
Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric
primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the
state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible
with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the
\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using
an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and
effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view
synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining
classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

Motivation: 传统情感计算方法忽略视觉显著性的作用，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用HD2S显著性模型和OpenFace面部动作单元分析，提取显著区域特征。

Conclusion: 基于显著性的方法为情感建模提供了高效且可解释的替代方案，适用于内容创作和个性化媒体体验。

Abstract: Understanding the emotional impact of videos is crucial for applications in
content creation, advertising, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
Traditional affective computing methods rely on self-reported emotions, facial
expression analysis, and biosensing data, yet they often overlook the role of
visual saliency -- the naturally attention-grabbing regions within a video. In
this study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based
approach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area
and number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace
facial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency
and viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with
multiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2)
Videos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce
low-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often
misalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations
in subjective reporting. By leveraging saliency-driven insights, this work
provides a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative for emotion
modeling, with implications for content creation, personalized media
experiences, and affective computing research.

Abstract: Automated pose correction remains a significant challenge in AI-driven

presents PosePilot, a novel system that integrates pose recognition with
real-time personalized corrective feedback, overcoming the limitations of
traditional fitness solutions. Using Yoga, a discipline requiring precise
spatio-temporal alignment as a case study, we demonstrate PosePilot's ability
to analyze complex physical movements. Designed for deployment on edge devices,
PosePilot can be extended to various at-home and outdoor exercises. We employ a
Vanilla LSTM, allowing the system to capture temporal dependencies for pose
recognition. Additionally, a BiLSTM with multi-head Attention enhances the
model's ability to process motion contexts, selectively focusing on key limb
angles for accurate error detection while maintaining computational efficiency.
As part of this work, we introduce a high-quality video dataset used for
evaluating our models. Most importantly, PosePilot provides instant corrective
feedback at every stage of a movement, ensuring precise posture adjustments
throughout the exercise routine. The proposed approach 1) performs automatic
human posture recognition, 2) provides personalized posture correction feedback
at each instant which is crucial in Yoga, and 3) offers a lightweight and
robust posture correction model feasible for deploying on edge devices in
real-world environments.

Motivation: 现有方法在文本到图像扩散模型微调中因奖励稀疏（每个生成轨迹仅有一个延迟奖励）而难以精确分配去噪动作的贡献，影响训练效率。

Method: 通过跟踪中间图像与最终图像之间余弦相似度的变化，动态分配密集奖励，量化每个去噪步骤对最终图像的贡献。

Conclusion: 提出的信用分配框架有效解决了奖励稀疏问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model fine-tuning leverage
reinforcement learning (RL) to align generated images with learnable reward
functions. The existing approaches reformulate denoising as a Markov decision
process for RL-driven optimization. However, they suffer from reward sparsity,
receiving only a single delayed reward per generated trajectory. This flaw
hinders precise step-level attribution of denoising actions, undermines
training efficiency. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective credit
assignment framework that dynamically distributes dense rewards across
denoising steps. Specifically, we track changes in cosine similarity between
intermediate and final images to quantify each step's contribution on
progressively reducing the distance to the final image. Our approach avoids
additional auxiliary neural networks for step-level preference modeling and
instead uses reward shaping to highlight denoising phases that have a greater
impact on image quality. Our method achieves 1.25 to 2 times higher sample
efficiency and better generalization across four human preference reward
functions, without compromising the original optimal policy.

Conclusion: PolyCL是一种高效的自监督学习框架，适用于医学图像分割，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the medical imaging
pipeline as it influences a number of image-based decisions. To be effective,
fully supervised segmentation approaches require large amounts of manually
annotated training data. However, the pixel-level annotation process is
expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, hindering progress and making it
challenging to perform effective segmentations. Therefore, models must learn
efficiently from limited labeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL),
particularly contrastive learning via pre-training on unlabeled data and
fine-tuning on limited annotations, can facilitate such limited labeled image
segmentation. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised contrastive
learning framework for medical image segmentation, leveraging inherent
relationships of different images, dubbed PolyCL. Without requiring any
pixel-level annotations or unreasonable data augmentations, our PolyCL learns
and transfers context-aware discriminant features useful for segmentation from
an innovative surrogate, in a task-related manner. Additionally, we integrate
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our framework in two novel ways: as a
post-processing refinement module that improves the accuracy of predicted masks
using bounding box prompts derived from coarse outputs, and as a propagation
mechanism via SAM 2 that generates volumetric segmentations from a single
annotated 2D slice. Experimental evaluations on three public computed
tomography (CT) datasets demonstrate that PolyCL outperforms fully-supervised
and self-supervised baselines in both low-data and cross-domain scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tbwa233/PolyCL.

Motivation: 理解无分类器引导（CFG）在图像生成中的工作机制，尽管其被广泛应用于先进系统，但其原理尚不明确。

Method: 通过简化线性扩散模型分析CFG，并将其行为与非线性模型对比。

Result: 发现CFG通过均值偏移、正负对比主成分三个组件提升生成质量，并在非线性模型中验证了这些机制。

Conclusion: 线性分析为理解非线性CFG提供了重要见解，尽管两者在低噪声水平下存在差异。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a core technique powering state-of-the-art
image generation systems, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this work, we begin by analyzing CFG in a simplified linear
diffusion model, where we show its behavior closely resembles that observed in
the nonlinear case. Our analysis reveals that linear CFG improves generation
quality via three distinct components: (i) a mean-shift term that approximately
steers samples in the direction of class means, (ii) a positive Contrastive
Principal Components (CPC) term that amplifies class-specific features, and
(iii) a negative CPC term that suppresses generic features prevalent in
unconditional data. We then verify that these insights in real-world, nonlinear
diffusion models: over a broad range of noise levels, linear CFG resembles the
behavior of its nonlinear counterpart. Although the two eventually diverge at
low noise levels, we discuss how the insights from the linear analysis still
shed light on the CFG's mechanism in the nonlinear regime.

Motivation: 直接利用IFMs进行视频自监督学习的潜力未被充分挖掘，研究旨在降低视频表示模型的训练成本。

Method: 在IFMs中引入时间建模模块（ResNet3D），采用播放速率感知的自监督学习方法训练时间模块，同时冻结IFM部分。

Result: 在UCF101上，AdViSe性能接近SOTA，训练时间减少3.4倍，GPU内存使用减少8.2倍。

Conclusion: AdViSe为基于预训练IFMs的低成本视频自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the past decade, image foundation models (IFMs) have achieved
unprecedented progress. However, the potential of directly using IFMs for video
self-supervised representation learning has largely been overlooked. In this
study, we propose an advancing video self-supervised learning (AdViSe)
approach, aimed at significantly reducing the training overhead of video
representation models using pre-trained IFMs. Specifically, we first introduce
temporal modeling modules (ResNet3D) to IFMs, constructing a video
representation model. We then employ a video self-supervised learning approach,
playback rate perception, to train temporal modules while freezing the IFM
components. Experiments on UCF101 demonstrate that AdViSe achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing training time by
$3.4\times$ and GPU memory usage by $8.2\times$. This study offers fresh
insights into low-cost video self-supervised learning based on pre-trained
IFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/JingwWu/advise-video-ssl.

TL;DR: 论文提出RAISE数据集，用于评估AI生成图像的感知真实性，并通过实验证明深度视觉模型能有效预测主观真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成图像的感知真实性难以客观评估，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过人类研究收集真实和AI生成图像的真实性评分，构建RAISE数据集，并训练多个模型预测真实性。

Result: 实验表明，深度视觉模型的特征能有效捕捉主观真实性。

Conclusion: RAISE为开发客观的感知真实性评估模型提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images
and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive.
However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated
counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of
AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective
nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating
the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a
new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores,
introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple
models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our
experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation
vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus
provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of
perceptual realness assessment.

Conclusion: DriveX作为通用世界模型，为稳健统一的自动驾驶框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Data-driven learning has advanced autonomous driving, yet task-specific
models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to their narrow
optimization objectives and reliance on costly annotated data. We present
DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics
and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale
driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that
unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic
representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution.
To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world
modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future
state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion
modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA),
a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from
DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D
future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art
results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and
end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a
general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous
driving frameworks.

Motivation: 图像分割是计算机视觉的基础任务，而参考图像分割通过自然语言表达定位特定对象，需要有效整合视觉和语言信息。

Method: 模型结合SE块动态特征重校准、可变形卷积几何适应性和残差连接，并引入RAF损失平衡区域对齐、边界精度和类别不平衡。

Result: 实验表明各组件均能提升性能，SegVLM在多样化数据集和参考表达场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SegVLM通过多组件协同和RAF损失，显著提升了参考图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at
partitioning an image into semantically meaningful regions. Referring image
segmentation extends this task by using natural language expressions to
localize specific objects, requiring effective integration of visual and
linguistic information. In this work, we propose SegVLM, a vision-language
model that incorporates architectural improvements to enhance segmentation
accuracy and cross-modal alignment. The model integrates squeeze-and-excitation
(SE) blocks for dynamic feature recalibration, deformable convolutions for
geometric adaptability, and residual connections for deep feature learning. We
also introduce a novel referring-aware fusion (RAF) loss that balances
region-level alignment, boundary precision, and class imbalance. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that each component contributes to
consistent performance improvements. SegVLM also shows strong generalization
across diverse datasets and referring expression scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolyPose是一种简单且鲁棒的方法，用于从少量2D X射线图像中确定患者的3D姿态，适用于术中环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在介入性手术中，快速2D成像（X射线）无法提供术前3D成像（如CT和MRI）的精确3D定位，因此需要一种方法将3D引导整合到术中。

Method: PolyPose通过将复杂的3D变形场参数化为刚性变换的组合，利用骨骼不弯曲的生物约束，避免了昂贵的变形正则化需求。

Result: 实验表明，PolyPose能够在仅使用两张X射线图像的稀疏视图和有限角度设置中成功对齐患者的术前体积。

Conclusion: PolyPose提供了一种在现有方法失败的挑战性场景中实现3D引导的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is
a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric
imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization
of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures,
where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance
into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method
for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D
deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the
biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion.
Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail
outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces
anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human
movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation
regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter
optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic
surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables
PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as
two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging
sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

Method: 利用大语言模型解析文本，提取语义基元并分阶段注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 实验验证了DiT-ST在缓解完整文本理解缺陷方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DiT-ST通过分割文本和分阶段注入，显著提升了扩散变换器的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion generation typically employs complete-text
conditioning. Due to the intricate syntax, diffusion transformers (DiTs)
inherently suffer from a comprehension defect of complete-text captions.
One-fly complete-text input either overlooks critical semantic details or
causes semantic confusion by simultaneously modeling diverse semantic primitive
types. To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text
conditioning framework named DiT-ST. This framework converts a complete-text
caption into a split-text caption, a collection of simplified sentences, to
explicitly express various semantic primitives and their interconnections. The
split-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST
in a hierarchical and incremental manner. Specifically, DiT-ST leverages Large
Language Models to parse captions, extracting diverse primitives and
hierarchically sorting out and constructing these primitives into a split-text
input. Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its
differential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine
the appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic
primitive types into input tokens via cross-attention. In this way, DiT-ST
enhances the representation learning of specific semantic primitive types
across different stages. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our proposed DiT-ST in mitigating the complete-text comprehension defect.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了极稀疏视角下的新视角合成问题，提升了场景覆盖率和图像质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis in 360$^\circ$ scenes from extremely sparse input views
is essential for applications like virtual reality and augmented reality. This
paper presents a novel framework for novel view synthesis in extremely
sparse-view cases. As typical structure-from-motion methods are unable to
estimate camera poses in extremely sparse-view cases, we apply DUSt3R to
estimate camera poses and generate a dense point cloud. Using the poses of
estimated cameras, we densely sample additional views from the upper hemisphere
space of the scenes, from which we render synthetic images together with the
point cloud. Training 3D Gaussian Splatting model on a combination of reference
images from sparse views and densely sampled synthetic images allows a larger
scene coverage in 3D space, addressing the overfitting challenge due to the
limited input in sparse-view cases. Retraining a diffusion-based image
enhancement model on our created dataset, we further improve the quality of the
point-cloud-rendered images by removing artifacts. We compare our framework
with benchmark methods in cases of only four input views, demonstrating
significant improvement in novel view synthesis under extremely sparse-view
conditions for 360$^\circ$ scenes.

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as
graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image
generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have
demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text.
TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the
rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However,
existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited
in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates
reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with
a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly
accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing
the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality
in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and
increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用预训练生成模型筛选高质量样本的方法，构建了通用SFT数据集Alchemist，显著提升了五种公开T2I模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT数据集多为窄领域且质量参差，通用高质量数据集稀缺且构建成本高，阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型作为样本影响力评估工具，构建紧凑高效的通用SFT数据集Alchemist。

Result: Alchemist显著提升了五种T2I模型的生成质量，同时保持了多样性和风格。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量通用SFT数据集提供了可行方案，并公开了数据集和微调模型权重以促进研究。

Abstract: Pre-training equips text-to-image (T2I) models with broad world knowledge,
but this alone is often insufficient to achieve high aesthetic quality and
alignment. Consequently, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for further
refinement. However, its effectiveness highly depends on the quality of the
fine-tuning dataset. Existing public SFT datasets frequently target narrow
domains (e.g., anime or specific art styles), and the creation of high-quality,
general-purpose SFT datasets remains a significant challenge. Current curation
methods are often costly and struggle to identify truly impactful samples. This
challenge is further complicated by the scarcity of public general-purpose
datasets, as leading models often rely on large, proprietary, and poorly
documented internal data, hindering broader research progress. This paper
introduces a novel methodology for creating general-purpose SFT datasets by
leveraging a pre-trained generative model as an estimator of high-impact
training samples. We apply this methodology to construct and release Alchemist,
a compact (3,350 samples) yet highly effective SFT dataset. Experiments
demonstrate that Alchemist substantially improves the generative quality of
five public T2I models while preserving diversity and style. Additionally, we
release the fine-tuned models' weights to the public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需息肉定位的全图像诊断框架ADD，通过像素级跨域知识蒸馏提升WLI息肉分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLI在资源有限环境中常用，但其分类性能较差，现有方法依赖息肉区域裁剪且易受检测误差影响。

Method: 提出Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD)模块，通过像素级跨域亲和力和CAM过滤实现精细知识蒸馏。

Result: 在公开和内部数据集上，AUC分别相对提升至少2.5%和16.2%。

Conclusion: ADD框架显著提升WLI分类性能，无需依赖息肉定位或图像对齐。

Abstract: White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main
colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical
chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common
and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However,
WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical
applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through
global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are
susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic
cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification
framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp
localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation
(ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation
regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to
explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to
establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along
the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation
reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter
cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those
semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by
at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively. Code is available at:

Motivation: 识别矛盾/犹豫情绪对个性化数字行为干预至关重要，但目前缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过在线平台收集视频数据，标注A/H片段，并提供多模态基线模型测试。

Result: 基线模型表现有限，突显了在真实视频中识别A/H的挑战。

Conclusion: BAH数据集为A/H识别研究提供了资源，但需进一步改进模型性能。

Abstract: Recognizing complex emotions linked to ambivalence and hesitancy (A/H) can
play a critical role in the personalization and effectiveness of digital
behaviour change interventions. These subtle and conflicting emotions are
manifested by a discord between multiple modalities, such as facial and vocal
expressions, and body language. Although experts can be trained to identify
A/H, integrating them into digital interventions is costly and less effective.
Automatic learning systems provide a cost-effective alternative that can adapt
to individual users, and operate seamlessly within real-time, and
resource-limited environments. However, there are currently no datasets
available for the design of ML models to recognize A/H. This paper introduces a
first Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset collected for
subject-based multimodal recognition of A/H in videos. It contains videos from
224 participants captured across 9 provinces in Canada, with different age, and
ethnicity. Through our web platform, we recruited participants to answer 7
questions, some of which were designed to elicit A/H while recording themselves
via webcam with microphone. BAH amounts to 1,118 videos for a total duration of
8.26 hours with 1.5 hours of A/H. Our behavioural team annotated timestamp
segments to indicate where A/H occurs, and provide frame- and video-level
annotations with the A/H cues. Video transcripts and their timestamps are also
included, along with cropped and aligned faces in each frame, and a variety of
participants meta-data. We include results baselines for BAH at frame- and
video-level recognition in multi-modal setups, in addition to zero-shot
prediction, and for personalization using unsupervised domain adaptation. The
limited performance of baseline models highlights the challenges of recognizing
A/H in real-world videos. The data, code, and pretrained weights are available.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模编辑对数据集或数据集无关技术，前者构建成本高且可能产生不真实样本，后者编辑能力有限。

Method: 利用文本-图像对作为监督，引入多尺度可学习区域定位和指导编辑过程。

Result: 在多种任务和基准测试中达到最优性能，并适应多种生成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像编辑提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two
directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to
improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free
techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires
carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in
unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may
suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing
capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel
paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available
and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our
approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the
editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual
descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing
regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent
image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while
exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在泛化到新类别或未见领域时性能下降，DiSa旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合交叉交互正则化（CIR）和方向性正则化策略，前者通过显著性掩码引导图像编码器关注关键区域，后者对齐视觉嵌入与类原型特征方向。

Result: 在11个图像分类基准测试中，DiSa在多种设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiSa通过正则化策略显著提升了模型泛化能力，适用于多种任务场景。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
vision-language models such as CLIP to downstream tasks. However, existing
methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance
degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address
this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning
framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to
enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR)
fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted
and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the
image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing
reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional
regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype
features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature
orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization
by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics.
Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate
that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods
across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset
transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

Result: 新方法显著提高了运动保真度和文本对齐能力，支持下游任务且无需额外调整。

Conclusion: 全局绝对坐标表示方法为未来研究和应用奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-motion generation models rely on the
kinematic-aware, local-relative motion representation popularized by HumanML3D,
which encodes motion relative to the pelvis and to the previous frame with
built-in redundancy. While this design simplifies training for earlier
generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and
hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion
representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned
alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global
space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this
formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text
alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and
no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally
supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and
temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and
costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we
demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices
in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and
motion-related applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为LACT重建提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Limited Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) often faces significant challenges
due to missing angular information. Unlike previous methods that operate in the
image domain, we propose a new method that focuses on sinogram inpainting. We
leverage MR-SDEs, a variant of diffusion models that characterize the diffusion
process with mean-reverting stochastic differential equations, to fill in
missing angular data at the projection level. Furthermore, by combining
distillation with constraining the output of the model using the pseudo-inverse
of the inpainting matrix, the diffusion process is accelerated and done in a
step, enabling efficient and accurate sinogram completion. A subsequent
post-processing module back-projects the inpainted sinogram into the image
domain and further refines the reconstruction, effectively suppressing
artifacts while preserving critical structural details. Quantitative
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual and fidelity quality, offering
a promising solution for LACT reconstruction in scientific and clinical
applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have sparked interest in world
models capable of simulating realistic environments. While navigation has been
well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces
remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces
as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable
users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as
poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric.
We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond
realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion
prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics
simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the
difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in
the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in
synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of
physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can
generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning
from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few
objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse
geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of
this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual
diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach
is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100
GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism,
bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions. We release all
datasets, code, weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决T2I模型生成敏感、侵权或有害图像的伦理、法律和安全问题。

Result: 提出了多维分类法，明确了擦除特异性、泛化性和计算复杂性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 为研究人员提供指导，推动生成式AI的负责任发展。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating high-quality and diverse visual content from natural language
prompts. However, uncontrolled reproduction of sensitive, copyrighted, or
harmful imagery poses serious ethical, legal, and safety challenges. To address
these concerns, the concept erasure paradigm has emerged as a promising
direction, enabling the selective removal of specific semantic concepts from
generative models while preserving their overall utility. This survey provides
a comprehensive overview and in-depth synthesis of concept erasure techniques
in T2I diffusion models. We systematically categorize existing approaches along
three key dimensions: intervention level, which identifies specific model
components targeted for concept removal; optimization structure, referring to
the algorithmic strategies employed to achieve suppression; and semantic scope,
concerning the complexity and nature of the concepts addressed. This
multi-dimensional taxonomy enables clear, structured comparisons across diverse
methodologies, highlighting fundamental trade-offs between erasure specificity,
generalization, and computational complexity. We further discuss current
evaluation benchmarks, standardized metrics, and practical datasets,
emphasizing gaps that limit comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding
robustness and practical effectiveness. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising future directions, including disentanglement of concept
representations, adaptive and incremental erasure strategies, adversarial
robustness, and new generative architectures. This survey aims to guide
researchers toward safer, more ethically aligned generative models, providing
foundational knowledge and actionable recommendations to advance responsible
development in generative AI.

TL;DR: MMIG-Bench是一个统一的多模态图像生成基准，结合文本提示和多视角参考图像，提供三级评估框架，用于全面评估17种先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估工具对多模态图像生成的评估不全面，缺乏统一标准，因此需要开发一个综合基准。

Method: 提出MMIG-Bench，包含4850个文本提示和1750张多视角参考图像，采用三级评估框架（低、中、高级指标）。

Result: 评估了17种先进模型，验证了指标与人类评分的相关性，提供了架构和数据设计的深入见解。

Conclusion: MMIG-Bench为多模态图像生成提供了统一的评估标准，将促进未来创新。

Abstract: Recent multimodal image generators such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at following complex instructions, editing images and
maintaining concept consistency. However, they are still evaluated by disjoint
toolkits: text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks that lacks multi-modal conditioning,
and customized image generation benchmarks that overlook compositional
semantics and common knowledge. We propose MMIG-Bench, a comprehensive
Multi-Modal Image Generation Benchmark that unifies these tasks by pairing
4,850 richly annotated text prompts with 1,750 multi-view reference images
across 380 subjects, spanning humans, animals, objects, and artistic styles.
MMIG-Bench is equipped with a three-level evaluation framework: (1) low-level
metrics for visual artifacts and identity preservation of objects; (2) novel
Aspect Matching Score (AMS): a VQA-based mid-level metric that delivers
fine-grained prompt-image alignment and shows strong correlation with human
judgments; and (3) high-level metrics for aesthetics and human preference.
Using MMIG-Bench, we benchmark 17 state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 2.5
Pro, FLUX, DreamBooth, and IP-Adapter, and validate our metrics with 32k human
ratings, yielding in-depth insights into architecture and data design. We will
release the dataset and evaluation code to foster rigorous, unified evaluation
and accelerate future innovations in multi-modal image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态对象破坏了场景一致性，导致跟踪漂移和映射伪影，现有方法依赖预定义类别且丢弃动态信息，无法满足机器人应用需求。

Method: 设计了基于场景一致性分析的自适应动态识别机制，通过几何和纹理差异比较实时观测与历史地图，并采用动态-静态分离映射策略。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上展示了灵活准确的动态分割能力，定位和映射性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ADD-SLAM无需预定义语义类别，自适应发现场景动态，有效减少动态目标干扰，实现了动态建模与静态场景的高效分离。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods have demonstrated
exceptional localization precision and remarkable dense mapping performance.
However, dynamic objects introduce critical challenges by disrupting scene
consistency, leading to tracking drift and mapping artifacts. Existing methods
that employ semantic segmentation or object detection for dynamic
identification and filtering typically rely on predefined categorical priors,
while discarding dynamic scene information crucial for robotic applications
such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and environmental interaction. To overcome
these challenges, we propose ADD-SLAM: an Adaptive Dynamic Dense SLAM framework
based on Gaussian splitting. We design an adaptive dynamic identification
mechanism grounded in scene consistency analysis, comparing geometric and
textural discrepancies between real-time observations and historical maps. Ours
requires no predefined semantic category priors and adaptively discovers scene
dynamics. Precise dynamic object recognition effectively mitigates interference
from moving targets during localization. Furthermore, we propose a
dynamic-static separation mapping strategy that constructs a temporal Gaussian
model to achieve online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on
multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate our method's flexible and accurate
dynamic segmentation capabilities, along with state-of-the-art performance in
both localization and mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动域适应方法仅关注不确定样本，忽略了置信样本的潜力，导致性能受限。

Method: 结合GPAS选择不确定样本，PLCS处理置信样本，逐步优化搜索空间和域适应。

Result: 在Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 联合处理不确定和置信样本能有效提升主动域适应性能。

Abstract: Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) adapts models to target domains by selectively
labeling a few target samples. Existing ADA methods prioritize uncertain
samples but overlook confident ones, which often match ground-truth. We find
that incorporating confident predictions into the labeled set before active
sampling reduces the search space and improves adaptation. To address this, we
propose a collaborative framework that labels uncertain samples while treating
highly confident predictions as ground truth. Our method combines Gaussian
Process-based Active Sampling (GPAS) for identifying uncertain samples and
Pseudo-Label-based Certain Sampling (PLCS) for confident ones, progressively
enhancing adaptation. PLCS refines the search space, and GPAS reduces the
domain gap, boosting the proportion of confident samples. Extensive experiments
on Office-Home and DomainNet show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ADA methods.

TL;DR: LlamaSeg是一个基于自然语言指令的统一图像分割框架，通过视觉生成方法将分割任务转化为自回归预测问题，并引入新数据集和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多种图像分割任务，并通过自然语言指令实现更灵活的分割需求。

Method: 将分割掩码表示为视觉令牌，使用LLaMA风格Transformer直接从图像输入预测，并构建SA-OVRS数据集支持训练。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上超越现有生成模型，生成更精细的分割掩码。

Conclusion: LlamaSeg为图像分割任务提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，并通过新指标提升了评估精度。

Abstract: We present LlamaSeg, a visual autoregressive framework that unifies multiple
image segmentation tasks via natural language instructions. We reformulate
image segmentation as a visual generation problem, representing masks as
"visual" tokens and employing a LLaMA-style Transformer to predict them
directly from image inputs. By adhering to the next-token prediction paradigm,
our approach naturally integrates segmentation tasks into autoregressive
architectures. To support large-scale training, we introduce a data annotation
pipeline and construct the SA-OVRS dataset, which contains 2M segmentation
masks annotated with over 5,800 open-vocabulary labels or diverse textual
descriptions, covering a wide spectrum of real-world scenarios. This enables
our model to localize objects in images based on text prompts and to generate
fine-grained masks. To more accurately evaluate the quality of masks produced
by visual generative models, we further propose a composite metric that
combines Intersection over Union (IoU) with Average Hausdorff Distance (AHD),
offering a more precise assessment of contour fidelity. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method surpasses existing generative models across
multiple datasets and yields more detailed segmentation masks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展带来了图像修复和编辑能力的提升，但也引发了社会风险，如恶意利用用户图像生成误导内容。现有方法在掩码引导编辑任务中表现不佳。

Method: SDA通过优化扰动，在初始去噪步骤中干扰自注意力机制中的查询，破坏轮廓生成过程，从而阻止模型生成连贯图像。

Result: 实验证明SDA在公开数据集上实现了最先进的保护性能，并具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SDA有效解决了扩散模型在图像编辑中的潜在风险，为敏感图像区域提供了强大的保护。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enhanced their image inpainting
and editing capabilities but also introduced significant societal risks.
Adversaries can exploit user images from social media to generate misleading or
harmful content. While adversarial perturbations can disrupt inpainting, global
perturbation-based methods fail in mask-guided editing tasks due to spatial
constraints. To address these challenges, we propose Structure Disruption
Attack (SDA), a powerful protection framework for safeguarding sensitive image
regions against inpainting-based editing. Building upon the contour-focused
nature of self-attention mechanisms of diffusion models, SDA optimizes
perturbations by disrupting queries in self-attention during the initial
denoising step to destroy the contour generation process. This targeted
interference directly disrupts the structural generation capability of
diffusion models, effectively preventing them from producing coherent images.
We validate our motivation through visualization techniques and extensive
experiments on public datasets, demonstrating that SDA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) protection performance while maintaining strong
robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSTrack的新型跟踪器，通过紧凑时空特征建模简化RGB-X跟踪设计，解决了现有方法中特征空间分散和计算复杂的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-X跟踪方法采用并行分支处理不同模态输入，导致特征空间分散和计算复杂，限制了时空建模能力。

Method: 提出空间紧凑模块整合RGB-X输入为紧凑空间特征，并设计时间紧凑模块通过目标分布热图表示时间特征。

Result: CSTrack在主流RGB-X基准测试中取得了新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 紧凑时空特征建模方法简单有效，显著提升了RGB-X跟踪性能。

Abstract: Effectively modeling and utilizing spatiotemporal features from RGB and other
modalities (\eg, depth, thermal, and event data, denoted as X) is the core of
RGB-X tracker design. Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to
separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to
simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the
model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality
spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational
overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal
modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses
on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective
tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module
that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature,
enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we
design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal
features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling
method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks.
The code and models will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用跨模态提示隔离，导致模态不平衡和性能下降，需改进。

Method: 提出MM-Prompt框架，结合跨模态提示查询和恢复，利用对齐损失防止表示漂移。

Result: 实验表明MM-Prompt在准确性和知识保留上优于现有方法，保持模态平衡。

Conclusion: MM-Prompt有效解决CVQA中的模态不平衡问题，提升持续学习效果。

Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs)
has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual
multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt
isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which
exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To
tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating
cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables
balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query
formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through
iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent
representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses
prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining
balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.

Abstract: Over 8,024 wildfire incidents have been documented in 2024 alone, affecting
thousands of fatalities and significant damage to infrastructure and
ecosystems. Wildfires in the United States have inflicted devastating losses.
Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, which highlights how urgently
efficient warning systems are needed to avoid disastrous outcomes. The goal of
this study is to enhance the accuracy of wildfire detection by using
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on the VGG16 architecture. The D-FIRE
dataset, which includes several kinds of wildfire and non-wildfire images, was
employed in the study. Low-resolution images, dataset imbalance, and the
necessity for real-time applicability are some of the main challenges. These
problems were resolved by enriching the dataset using data augmentation
techniques and optimizing the VGG16 model for binary classification. The model
produced a low false negative rate, which is essential for reducing unexplored
fires, despite dataset boundaries. In order to help authorities execute fast
responses, this work shows that deep learning models such as VGG16 can offer a
reliable, automated approach for early wildfire recognition. For the purpose of
reducing the impact of wildfires, our future work will concentrate on
connecting to systems with real-time surveillance networks and enlarging the
dataset to cover more varied fire situations.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在快速变化场景中立体深度估计效果不佳，而脉冲相机虽提供高分辨率异步事件，但缺乏针对脉冲数据的专用算法和基准。

Method: 提出SpikeStereoNet框架，融合双视角脉冲流，通过循环脉冲神经网络（RSNN）迭代优化深度估计。

Conclusion: SpikeStereoNet填补了脉冲数据立体深度估计的空白，展示了脉冲流在复杂场景中的潜力，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation
in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit
asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative
sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms
and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose
SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo
depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from
two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent
spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we
introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo
spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing
methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle
edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces
and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong
data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced
training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: 3D vector graphics play a crucial role in various applications including 3D
shape retrieval, conceptual design, and virtual reality interactions due to
their ability to capture essential structural information with minimal

vector graphics, they often suffer from lengthy processing times and struggle
to maintain view consistency. To address these limitations, we propose
ViewCraft3D (VC3D), an efficient method that leverages 3D priors to generate 3D

employs a geometric extraction algorithm to fit 3D vector graphics to the
underlying structure, and applies view-consistent refinement process to enhance
visual quality. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VC3D outperforms
previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while
significantly reducing computational overhead. The resulting 3D sketches
maintain view consistency and effectively capture the essential characteristics

Abstract: Video action understanding tasks in real-world scenarios always suffer data
limitations. In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding
problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a
text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model
training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on
an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information
enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to
generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than
generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement
strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated
samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we
observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model
training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing
strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their
impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four
datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for
zero-shot action recognition.

Conclusion: 通过系统性优化视觉依赖和生成控制，该方法有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually generate texts which satisfy
context coherence but don't match the visual input. Such a hallucination issue
hinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving
hallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual
content. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a
specific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in
LVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In
this paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the
visual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based
on our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three
aspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in
generating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual
tokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate
prior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We
propose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian
perspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the
posterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to
a prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at
all. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.
Extensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME
demonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue
of LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task of separating an image into
albedo and shade. In real-world scenes, it is difficult to quantitatively
assess IID quality due to the unavailability of ground truth. The existing
method provides the relative reflection intensities based on human-judged
annotations. However, these annotations have challenges in subjectivity,
relative evaluation, and hue non-assessment. To address these, we propose a
concept of quantitative evaluation with a calculated albedo from a
hyperspectral imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) intensity.
Additionally, we introduce an optional albedo densification approach based on
spectral similarity. This paper conducted a concept verification in a
laboratory environment, and suggested the feasibility of an objective,
absolute, and hue-aware assessment. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.

Abstract: Recent methods for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection
typically leverage the generalization ability of large Vision-Language Model
(VLM), i.e., CLIP, on unseen categories, showing impressive results on various
zero-shot settings. However, existing methods struggle to adapt CLIP
representations for human-object pairs, as CLIP tends to overlook fine-grained
information necessary for distinguishing interactions. To address this issue,
we devise, LAIN, a novel zero-shot HOI detection framework enhancing the
locality and interaction awareness of CLIP representations. The locality
awareness, which involves capturing fine-grained details and the spatial
structure of individual objects, is achieved by aggregating the information and
spatial priors of adjacent neighborhood patches. The interaction awareness,
which involves identifying whether and how a human is interacting with an
object, is achieved by capturing the interaction pattern between the human and
the object. By infusing locality and interaction awareness into CLIP
representation, LAIN captures detailed information about the human-object
pairs. Our extensive experiments on existing benchmarks show that LAIN
outperforms previous methods on various zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
importance of locality and interaction awareness for effective zero-shot HOI
detection.

Abstract: Multimodal machine translation (MMT) seeks to address the challenges posed by
linguistic polysemy and ambiguity in translation tasks by incorporating visual
information. A key bottleneck in current MMT research is the effective
utilization of visual data. Previous approaches have focused on extracting
global or region-level image features and using attention or gating mechanisms
for multimodal information fusion. However, these methods have not adequately
tackled the issue of visual information redundancy in MMT, nor have they
proposed effective solutions. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach--multimodal machine translation with visual Scene Graph Pruning (PSG),
which leverages language scene graph information to guide the pruning of
redundant nodes in visual scene graphs, thereby reducing noise in downstream
translation tasks. Through extensive comparative experiments with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of the PSG model. Our results also highlight the promising potential of visual
information pruning in advancing the field of MMT.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效补全点云并改善初始刚性配准结果。

Conclusion: VN-OccNet的旋转等变性和表面生成能力为术中点云配准提供了新思路，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Intra-operative data captured during image-guided surgery lacks sub-surface
information, where key regions of interest, such as vessels and tumors, reside.
Image-to-physical registration enables the fusion of pre-operative information
and intra-operative data, typically represented as a point cloud. However, this
registration process struggles due to partial visibility of the intra-operative
point cloud. In this research, we propose a patient-specific point cloud
completion approach to assist with the registration process. Specifically, we
leverage VN-OccNet to generate a complete liver surface from a partial
intra-operative point cloud. The network is trained in a patient-specific
manner, where simulated deformations from the pre-operative model are used to
train the model. First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of VN-OccNet's
rotation-equivariant property and its effectiveness in recovering complete
surfaces from partial intra-operative surfaces. Next, we integrate the
completed intra-operative surface into the Go-ICP registration algorithm to
demonstrate its utility in improving initial rigid registration outcomes. Our
results highlight the promise of this patient-specific completion approach in
mitigating the challenges posed by partial intra-operative visibility. The
rotation equivariant and surface generation capabilities of VN-OccNet hold
strong promise for developing robust registration frameworks for variations of
the intra-operative point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化任务中，模型需在适应新主题的同时保持原有生成能力，但标准训练目标与个性化目标不匹配，导致分布漂移。

Method: 提出基于Lipschitz约束的训练目标，显式限制与预训练分布的偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CLIP-T、CLIP-I和DINO分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法有效控制分布漂移，提升了模型在个性化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Personalization using text-to-image diffusion models involves adapting a
pretrained model to novel subjects with only a few image examples. This task
presents a fundamental challenge, as the model must not only learn the new
subject effectively but also preserve its ability to generate diverse and
coherent outputs across a wide range of prompts. In other words, successful
personalization requires integrating new concepts without forgetting previously
learned generative capabilities. Forgetting denotes unintended distributional
drift, where the model's output distribution deviates from that of the original
pretrained model. In this paper, we provide an analysis of this issue and
identify a mismatch between standard training objectives and the goals of
personalization. To address this, we propose a new training objective based on
a Lipschitz-bounded formulation that explicitly constrains deviation from the
pretrained distribution. Our method provides improved control over
distributional drift and performs well even in data-scarce scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing personalization methods, achieving higher CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO
scores.

Conclusion: TDVE-DB和TDVE-Assessor为文本驱动视频编辑的评估提供了重要工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Text-driven video editing is rapidly advancing, yet its rigorous evaluation
remains challenging due to the absence of dedicated video quality assessment
(VQA) models capable of discerning the nuances of editing quality. To address
this critical gap, we introduce TDVE-DB, a large-scale benchmark dataset for
text-driven video editing. TDVE-DB consists of 3,857 edited videos generated
from 12 diverse models across 8 editing categories, and is annotated with
173,565 human subjective ratings along three crucial dimensions, i.e., edited
video quality, editing alignment, and structural consistency. Based on TDVE-DB,
we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation for the 12 state-of-the-art editing
models revealing the strengths and weaknesses of current video techniques, and
then benchmark existing VQA methods in the context of text-driven video editing
evaluation. Building on these insights, we propose TDVE-Assessor, a novel VQA
model specifically designed for text-driven video editing assessment.
TDVE-Assessor integrates both spatial and temporal video features into a large
language model (LLM) for rich contextual understanding to provide comprehensive
quality assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDVE-Assessor
substantially outperforms existing VQA models on TDVE-DB across all three
evaluation dimensions, setting a new state-of-the-art. Both TDVE-DB and

TL;DR: FlowCut提出了一种基于信息流的视觉令牌剪枝框架，解决了现有单层注意力评分方法的不足，显著提升了模型效率和性能。


<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在计算成本高的问题，现有剪枝方法依赖单层注意力评分，但无法充分识别冗余令牌。

Method: 通过分析信息流，发现CLS令牌作为信息中继，提出FlowCut框架，动态剪枝冗余视觉令牌。

Result: FlowCut在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NeXT-7B上分别实现1.6%和4.3%的性能提升，令牌减少88.9%和94.4%，预填充阶段速度提升3.2倍。

Conclusion: FlowCut通过信息流分析优化剪枝，显著提升模型效率，为LVLMs的冗余令牌处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but
suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing
pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and
prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the
interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic
question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify
redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant
visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models
the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves
between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information
relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy
emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration;
and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to
contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an
information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the
current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the
model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves
superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token
reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x
speed-up in the prefilling stage. Our code is available at

Conclusion: SMART-PC通过轻量化设计实现了高效且高性能的3D点云分类。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising solution to address
distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. However, existing methods
often rely on computationally expensive backpropagation during adaptation,
limiting their applicability in real-world, time-sensitive scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce SMART-PC, a skeleton-based framework that enhances
resilience to corruptions by leveraging the geometric structure of 3D point
clouds. During pre-training, our method predicts skeletal representations,
enabling the model to extract robust and meaningful geometric features that are
less sensitive to corruptions, thereby improving adaptability to test-time
distribution shifts. Unlike prior approaches, SMART-PC achieves real-time
adaptation by eliminating backpropagation and updating only BatchNorm
statistics, resulting in a lightweight and efficient framework capable of
achieving high frame-per-second rates while maintaining superior classification
performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C, demonstrate that SMART-PC
achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing methods such as MATE
in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The implementation is

Conclusion: ASR模块在布局生成中表现出色，兼具结构保留和生成多样性，支持人机协作设计。

Abstract: Time consumption and the complexity of manual layout design make automated
layout generation a critical task, especially for multiple applications across
different mobile devices. Existing graph-based layout generation approaches
suffer from limited generative capability, often resulting in unreasonable and
incompatible outputs. Meanwhile, vision based generative models tend to
overlook the original structural information, leading to component
intersections and overlaps. To address these challenges, we propose an
Aggregation Structural Representation (ASR) module that integrates graph
networks with large language models (LLMs) to preserve structural information
while enhancing generative capability. This novel pipeline utilizes graph
features as hierarchical prior knowledge, replacing the traditional Vision
Transformer (ViT) module in multimodal large language models (MLLM) to predict
full layout information for the first time. Moreover, the intermediate graph
matrix used as input for the LLM is human editable, enabling progressive, human
centric design generation. A comprehensive evaluation on the RICO dataset
demonstrates the strong performance of ASR, both quantitatively using mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU), and qualitatively through a crowdsourced user
study. Additionally, sampling on relational features ensures diverse layout
generation, further enhancing the adaptability and creativity of the proposed
approach.

Abstract: Neural fields are now the central focus of research in 3D vision and computer
graphics. Existing methods mainly focus on various scene representations, such
as neural points and 3D Gaussians. However, few works have studied the
rendering process to enhance the neural fields. In this work, we propose a
plug-in method named K-Buffers that leverages multiple buffers to improve the
rendering performance. Our method first renders K buffers from scene
representations and constructs K pixel-wise feature maps. Then, We introduce a
K-Feature Fusion Network (KFN) to merge the K pixel-wise feature maps. Finally,
we adopt a feature decoder to generate the rendering image. We also introduce
an acceleration strategy to improve rendering speed and quality. We apply our
method to well-known radiance field baselines, including neural point fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method effectively enhances the rendering performance of neural point fields
and 3DGS.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems have
rapidly evolved to tackle incremental recognition challenges in operational
settings. Data scarcity remains a major hurdle that conventional SAR-ATR
techniques struggle to address. To cope with this challenge, we propose a
few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) framework based on a dual-branch
architecture that focuses on local feature extraction and leverages the
discrete Fourier transform and global filters to capture long-term spatial
dependencies. This incorporates a lightweight cross-attention mechanism that
fuses domain-specific features with global dependencies to ensure robust
feature interaction, while maintaining computational efficiency by introducing
minimal scale-shift parameters. The framework combines focal loss for class
distinction under imbalance and center loss for compact intra-class
distributions to enhance class separation boundaries. Experimental results on
the MSTAR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL SAR-ATR, attesting
to its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Open vocabulary image segmentation tackles the challenge of recognizing
dynamically adjustable, predefined novel categories at inference time by
leveraging vision-language alignment. However, existing paradigms typically
perform class-agnostic region segmentation followed by category matching, which
deviates from the human visual system's process of recognizing objects based on
semantic concepts, leading to poor alignment between region segmentation and
target concepts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cognition-Inspired
Framework for open vocabulary image segmentation that emulates the human visual
recognition process: first forming a conceptual understanding of an object,
then perceiving its spatial extent. The framework consists of three core
components: (1) A Generative Vision-Language Model (G-VLM) that mimics human
cognition by generating object concepts to provide semantic guidance for region
segmentation. (2) A Concept-Aware Visual Enhancer Module that fuses textual
concept features with global visual representations, enabling adaptive visual
perception based on target concepts. (3) A Cognition-Inspired Decoder that
integrates local instance features with G-VLM-provided semantic cues, allowing
selective classification over a subset of relevant categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements,
reaching $27.2$ PQ, $17.0$ mAP, and $35.3$ mIoU on A-150. It further attains
$56.2$, $28.2$, $15.4$, $59.2$, $18.7$, and $95.8$ mIoU on Cityscapes,
Mapillary Vistas, A-847, PC-59, PC-459, and PAS-20, respectively. In addition,
our framework supports vocabulary-free segmentation, offering enhanced
flexibility in recognizing unseen categories. Code will be public.

Conclusion: VTBench将开源，以推动虚拟试穿技术在真实场景中的应用和发展。

Abstract: While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these
models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive
benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately
reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most
existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for
real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements
in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a
hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image
try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored
test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1)
Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical
dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture
preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability,
and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test
sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging
scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for
each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality
across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor
settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and
investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To
foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario,
VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols,
generated results, and human annotations.

Abstract: Securing personal identity against deepfake attacks is increasingly critical
in the digital age, especially for celebrities and political figures whose
faces are easily accessible and frequently targeted. Most existing deepfake
detection methods focus on general-purpose scenarios and often ignore the
valuable prior knowledge of known facial identities, e.g., "VIP individuals"
whose authentic facial data are already available. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{VIPGuard}, a unified multimodal framework designed to capture
fine-grained and comprehensive facial representations of a given identity,
compare them against potentially fake or similar-looking faces, and reason over
these comparisons to make accurate and explainable predictions. Specifically,
our framework consists of three main stages. First, fine-tune a multimodal
large language model (MLLM) to learn detailed and structural facial attributes.
Second, we perform identity-level discriminative learning to enable the model
to distinguish subtle differences between highly similar faces, including real
and fake variations. Finally, we introduce user-specific customization, where
we model the unique characteristics of the target face identity and perform
semantic reasoning via MLLM to enable personalized and explainable deepfake
detection. Our framework shows clear advantages over previous detection works,
where traditional detectors mainly rely on low-level visual cues and provide no
human-understandable explanations, while other MLLM-based models often lack a
detailed understanding of specific face identities. To facilitate the
evaluation of our method, we built a comprehensive identity-aware benchmark
called \textbf{VIPBench} for personalized deepfake detection, involving the
latest 7 face-swapping and 7 entire face synthesis techniques for generation.

Abstract: Ratio-based biomarkers -- such as the proportion of necrotic tissue within a
tumor -- are widely used in clinical practice to support diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment planning. These biomarkers are typically estimated from soft
segmentation outputs by computing region-wise ratios. Despite the high-stakes
nature of clinical decision making, existing methods provide only point
estimates, offering no measure of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a
unified \textit{confidence-aware} framework for estimating ratio-based
biomarkers. We conduct a systematic analysis of error propagation in the
segmentation-to-biomarker pipeline and identify model miscalibration as the
dominant source of uncertainty. To mitigate this, we incorporate a lightweight,
post-hoc calibration module that can be applied using internal hospital data
without retraining. We leverage a tunable parameter $Q$ to control the
confidence level of the derived bounds, allowing adaptation towards clinical
practice. Extensive experiments show that our method produces statistically
sound confidence intervals, with tunable confidence levels, enabling more
trustworthy application of predictive biomarkers in clinical workflows.

Abstract: In contrast to vision transformers, which model long-range dependencies
through global self-attention, large kernel convolutions provide a more
efficient and scalable alternative, particularly in high-resolution 3D
volumetric settings. However, naively increasing kernel size often leads to
optimization instability and degradation in performance. Motivated by the
spatial bias observed in effective receptive fields (ERFs), we hypothesize that
different kernel elements converge at variable rates during training. To
support this, we derive a theoretical connection between element-wise gradients
and first-order optimization, showing that structurally re-parameterized
convolution blocks inherently induce spatially varying learning rates. Building
on this insight, we introduce Rep3D, a 3D convolutional framework that
incorporates a learnable spatial prior into large kernel training. A
lightweight two-stage modulation network generates a receptive-biased scaling
mask, adaptively re-weighting kernel updates and enabling local-to-global
convergence behavior. Rep3D adopts a plain encoder design with large depthwise
convolutions, avoiding the architectural complexity of multi-branch
compositions. We evaluate Rep3D on five challenging 3D segmentation benchmarks
and demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
including transformer-based and fixed-prior re-parameterization methods. By
unifying spatial inductive bias with optimization-aware learning, Rep3D offers
an interpretable, and scalable solution for 3D medical image analysis. The

TL;DR: 论文提出JailBound框架，通过探索视觉语言模型（VLM）的潜在安全边界，实现高效越狱攻击，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有越狱方法缺乏明确攻击目标，梯度策略易陷入局部最优且忽略跨模态交互，导致效果受限。

Method: JailBound分为两阶段：1) 安全边界探测，在潜在空间中近似决策边界；2) 安全边界跨越，联合优化图像和文本输入的对抗扰动。

Result: 在六种VLM上实验，平均白盒和黑盒攻击成功率分别达94.32%和67.28%，比现有方法高6.17%和21.13%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLM潜在的安全风险，呼吁加强防御措施。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive performance, yet the
integration of powerful vision encoders has significantly broadened their
attack surface, rendering them increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks.
However, lacking well-defined attack objectives, existing jailbreak methods
often struggle with gradient-based strategies prone to local optima and lacking
precise directional guidance, and typically decouple visual and textual
modalities, thereby limiting their effectiveness by neglecting crucial
cross-modal interactions. Inspired by the Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK)
framework, we posit that VLMs encode safety-relevant information within their
internal fusion-layer representations, revealing an implicit safety decision
boundary in the latent space. This motivates exploiting boundary to steer model
behavior. Accordingly, we propose JailBound, a novel latent space jailbreak
framework comprising two stages: (1) Safety Boundary Probing, which addresses
the guidance issue by approximating decision boundary within fusion layer's
latent space, thereby identifying optimal perturbation directions towards the
target region; and (2) Safety Boundary Crossing, which overcomes the
limitations of decoupled approaches by jointly optimizing adversarial
perturbations across both image and text inputs. This latter stage employs an
innovative mechanism to steer the model's internal state towards
policy-violating outputs while maintaining cross-modal semantic consistency.
Extensive experiments on six diverse VLMs demonstrate JailBound's efficacy,
achieves 94.32% white-box and 67.28% black-box attack success averagely, which
are 6.17% and 21.13% higher than SOTA methods, respectively. Our findings
expose a overlooked safety risk in VLMs and highlight the urgent need for more
robust defenses. Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful
and offensive content.

Conclusion: 视觉重聚焦强化框架能有效提升多模态模型对隐藏物体的识别能力，甚至超越人类伪装感知系统。

Abstract: Current multi-modal models exhibit a notable misalignment with the human
visual system when identifying objects that are visually assimilated into the
background. Our observations reveal that these multi-modal models cannot
distinguish concealed objects, demonstrating an inability to emulate human
cognitive processes which effectively utilize foreground-background similarity
principles for visual analysis. To analyze this hidden human-model visual
thinking discrepancy, we build a visual system that mimicks human visual
camouflaged perception to progressively and iteratively `refocus' visual
concealed content. The refocus is a progressive guidance mechanism enabling
models to logically localize objects in visual images through stepwise
reasoning. The localization process of concealed objects requires hierarchical
attention shifting with dynamic adjustment and refinement of prior cognitive
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a visual refocus reinforcement framework
via the policy optimization algorithm to encourage multi-modal models to think
and refocus more before answering, and achieve excellent reasoning abilities to
align and even surpass human camouflaged perception systems. Our extensive
experiments on camouflaged perception successfully demonstrate the emergence of
refocus visual phenomena, characterized by multiple reasoning tokens and
dynamic adjustment of the detection box. Besides, experimental results on both
camouflaged object classification and detection tasks exhibit significantly
superior performance compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baselines.

TL;DR: TESSER是一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过特征敏感梯度缩放和频谱平滑正则化提升对抗样本的迁移性，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗迁移性是评估深度神经网络鲁棒性的关键挑战，尤其在安全关键应用中。现有攻击方法在ViTs和CNNs之间的迁移效果不佳，需要改进。

Method: TESSER采用特征敏感梯度缩放（FSGS）和频谱平滑正则化（SSR）生成语义有意义且频谱平滑的扰动。

Result: 在ImageNet上12种架构的实验中，TESSER在CNNs和ViTs上的攻击成功率分别比现有方法高10.9%和7.2%，且在防御模型上表现优异。

Conclusion: TESSER通过结合FSGS和SSR，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性和鲁棒性，为对抗威胁评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the
robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications,
transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals,
making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance,
existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures,
especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack
framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1)
\textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients
based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations,
and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses
high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior.
These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both
semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves
+10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to
the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER
significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\%
ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment
between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via
Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in
high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.

Abstract: Self-supervised image denoising methods have garnered significant research
attention in recent years, for this kind of method reduces the requirement of
large training datasets. Compared to supervised methods, self-supervised
methods rely more on the prior embedded in deep networks themselves. As a
result, most of the self-supervised methods are designed with Convolution
Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, which well capture one of the most
important image prior, translation equivariant prior. Inspired by the great
success achieved by the introduction of translational equivariance, in this
paper, we explore the way to further incorporate another important image prior.
Specifically, we first apply high-accuracy rotation equivariant convolution to
self-supervised image denoising. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we have
proved that simply replacing all the convolution layers with rotation
equivariant convolution layers would modify the network into its rotation
equivariant version. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
rotation equivariant image prior is introduced to self-supervised image
denoising at the network architecture level with a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of equivariance errors, which offers a new perspective to the field of
self-supervised image denoising. Moreover, to further improve the performance,
we design a new mask mechanism to fusion the output of rotation equivariant
network and vanilla CNN-based network, and construct an adaptive rotation
equivariant framework. Through extensive experiments on three typical methods,
we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿技术在保持不同姿势一致性方面存在挑战，如几何变形、语义不一致和细节丢失。

Method: HF-VTON包含三个模块：APWAM（对齐服装与姿势）、SRCM（增强语义表示）和MPAGM（优化外观生成）。

Result: 实验表明，HF-VTON在VITON-HD和SAMP-VTONS数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在视觉保真度和细节保留方面。

Conclusion: HF-VTON通过多模块协作解决了虚拟试穿中的关键问题，提升了跨姿势的试穿效果。

Abstract: Virtual try-on technology has become increasingly important in the fashion
and retail industries, enabling the generation of high-fidelity garment images
that adapt seamlessly to target human models. While existing methods have
achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in
maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric
distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment
structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the
loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To
address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures
high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists
of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module
(APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric
deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation
and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes
and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural,
textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided
Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and
prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation,
ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome
data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset,
featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more
comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling
in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the
heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment.
While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a
systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this
work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges
through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and
modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first
comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence
downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose
Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive
relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks,
outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored
training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning.
This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational
blueprint for future research in multimodal systems. Our project is available

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are gaining traction in the visual generative area
for their efficiency and compatibility. However, the pioneered attempts still
fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise
(absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the
rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to
extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion
models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse
during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash
sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the
diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations
lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need
for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly
outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with
the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.

Result: 在Fundus分割和2D MRI前列腺分割任务中，LangDAug优于现有域泛化方法。

Conclusion: LangDAug不仅性能优越，还能与现有域随机化方法互补，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models often struggle to generalize across
different domains due to various reasons. Domain Generalization (DG) methods
overcome this either through representation learning or data augmentation
(DAug). While representation learning methods seek domain-invariant features,
they often rely on ad-hoc techniques and lack formal guarantees. DAug methods,
which enrich model representations through synthetic samples, have shown
comparable or superior performance to representation learning approaches. We
propose LangDAug, a novel $\textbf{Lang}$evin $\textbf{D}$ata
$\textbf{Aug}$mentation for multi-source domain generalization in 2D medical
image segmentation. LangDAug leverages Energy-Based Models (EBMs) trained via
contrastive divergence to traverse between source domains, generating
intermediate samples through Langevin dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that
LangDAug induces a regularization effect, and for GLMs, it upper-bounds the
Rademacher complexity by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
Through extensive experiments on Fundus segmentation and 2D MRI prostate
segmentation benchmarks, we show that LangDAug outperforms state-of-the-art
domain generalization methods and effectively complements existing
domain-randomization approaches. The codebase for our method is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过改进注意力机制和特征聚合，显著提升了多图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can achieve higher image quality than
single-image super-resolution (SISR) by aggregating sub-pixel information from
multiple spatially shifted frames. Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution
(BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of
applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their
superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most
existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that
restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation
hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for
high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms:
overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more
precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple
frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the
cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution
test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.

Result: VisCRA在多个主流MLRMs上攻击成功率显著（如Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking达76.48%）。

Conclusion: MLRMs的视觉推理能力既是优势也是攻击漏洞，需重视安全风险。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLRMs) has enabled
sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities by integrating reinforcement
learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. However, while these enhanced
reasoning capabilities improve performance, they also introduce new and
underexplored safety risks. In this work, we systematically investigate the
security implications of advanced visual reasoning in MLRMs. Our analysis
reveals a fundamental trade-off: as visual reasoning improves, models become
more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Motivated by this critical finding, we
introduce VisCRA (Visual Chain Reasoning Attack), a novel jailbreak framework
that exploits the visual reasoning chains to bypass safety mechanisms. VisCRA
combines targeted visual attention masking with a two-stage reasoning induction
strategy to precisely control harmful outputs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate VisCRA's significant effectiveness, achieving high attack success
rates on leading closed-source MLRMs: 76.48% on Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking,
68.56% on QvQ-Max, and 56.60% on GPT-4o. Our findings highlight a critical
insight: the very capability that empowers MLRMs -- their visual reasoning --
can also serve as an attack vector, posing significant security risks.

Conclusion: DriveCamSim为自动驾驶视觉算法评估提供了灵活且通用的相机模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Camera sensor simulation serves as a critical role for autonomous driving
(AD), e.g. evaluating vision-based AD algorithms. While existing approaches
have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they
remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera
viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream
applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation
framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit
Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through
vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across
multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to
the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of
views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For
controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in
existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an
information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only
improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be
identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering.
With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督跨域视觉情感识别（UCDVER）任务，并设计了KCDP框架以解决情感表达变异和分布偏移问题，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉情感识别（VER）研究局限于单一领域，缺乏跨域泛化能力，因此提出UCDVER任务以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出KCDP框架，利用VLM对齐情感表示，并通过扩散模型增强视觉情感感知；同时使用CLIEA方法生成高质量伪标签。

Result: 实验显示KCDP在感知性和泛化性上优于现有方法，如比TGCA-PVT模型提升12%。

Conclusion: KCDP框架有效解决了跨域情感识别的挑战，为无监督跨域VER任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is a critical yet challenging task aimed at
inferring emotional states of individuals based on visual cues. However,
existing works focus on single domains, e.g., realistic images or stickers,
limiting VER models' cross-domain generalizability. To fill this gap, we
introduce an Unsupervised Cross-Domain Visual Emotion Recognition (UCDVER)
task, which aims to generalize visual emotion recognition from the source
domain (e.g., realistic images) to the low-resource target domain (e.g.,
stickers) in an unsupervised manner. Compared to the conventional unsupervised
domain adaptation problems, UCDVER presents two key challenges: a significant
emotional expression variability and an affective distribution shift. To
mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-aligned
Counterfactual-enhancement Diffusion Perception (KCDP) framework. Specifically,
KCDP leverages a VLM to align emotional representations in a shared knowledge
space and guides diffusion models for improved visual affective perception.
Furthermore, a Counterfactual-Enhanced Language-image Emotional Alignment
(CLIEA) method generates high-quality pseudo-labels for the target domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses SOTA models in both
perceptibility and generalization, e.g., gaining 12% improvements over the SOTA
VER model TGCA-PVT. The project page is at https://yinwen2019.github.io/ucdver.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文主张MOS（平均意见分）作为多媒体质量评估的唯一监督信号已不足，需结合上下文感知、推理能力和多模态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOS将丰富的人类判断简化为单一标量，忽略了语义失败、用户意图和判断依据，需改进。

Method: 提出结合上下文感知、推理和多模态能力的评估模型，并建议改进数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提出改革路线图，包括更丰富的数据集和新评估指标。

Conclusion: 通过重构质量评估为上下文感知、可解释和多模态任务，推动更鲁棒、人性化的评估系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that Mean Opinion Score (MOS), while historically
foundational, is no longer sufficient as the sole supervisory signal for
multimedia quality assessment models. MOS reduces rich, context-sensitive human
judgments to a single scalar, obscuring semantic failures, user intent, and the
rationale behind quality decisions. We contend that modern quality assessment
models must integrate three interdependent capabilities: (1) context-awareness,
to adapt evaluations to task-specific goals and viewing conditions; (2)
reasoning, to produce interpretable, evidence-grounded justifications for
quality judgments; and (3) multimodality, to align perceptual and semantic cues
using vision-language models. We critique the limitations of current
MOS-centric benchmarks and propose a roadmap for reform: richer datasets with
contextual metadata and expert rationales, and new evaluation metrics that
assess semantic alignment, reasoning fidelity, and contextual sensitivity. By
reframing quality assessment as a contextual, explainable, and multimodal
modeling task, we aim to catalyze a shift toward more robust, human-aligned,
and trustworthy evaluation systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Point-RFT框架，通过视觉基础的CoT推理提升视觉文档理解，显著优于纯文本CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本CoT在视觉语言任务中存在视觉幻觉和多模态整合不足的问题，需改进。

Method: 分两阶段：格式微调（使用71K带视觉标注的数据集）和强化微调。

Result: 在ChartQA上准确率从70.88%提升至90.04%，泛化能力优于纯文本CoT。

Conclusion: 视觉基础的CoT更有效，Point-RFT在复杂场景中潜力显著。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved textual
reasoning through the effective use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and reinforcement
learning. However, extending these successes to vision-language tasks remains
challenging due to inherent limitations in text-only CoT, such as visual
hallucinations and insufficient multimodal integration. In this paper, we
introduce Point-RFT, a multimodal reasoning framework explicitly designed to
leverage visually grounded CoT reasoning for visual document understanding. Our
approach consists of two stages: First, we conduct format finetuning using a
curated dataset of 71K diverse visual reasoning problems, each annotated with
detailed, step-by-step rationales explicitly grounded to corresponding visual
elements. Second, we employ reinforcement finetuning targeting visual document
understanding. On ChartQA, our approach improves accuracy from 70.88%
(format-finetuned baseline) to 90.04%, surpassing the 83.92% accuracy achieved
by reinforcement finetuning relying solely on text-based CoT. The result shows
that our grounded CoT is more effective for multimodal reasoning compared with
the text-only CoT. Moreover, Point-RFT exhibits superior generalization
capability across several out-of-domain visual document reasoning benchmarks,
including CharXiv, PlotQA, IconQA, TabMWP, etc., and highlights its potential
in complex real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过适配器生成伪文本标记，未能直接优化组合查询表示，限制了检索性能。

Method: 利用预训练多模态大语言模型（MLLM）构建两个互补任务，联合优化以增强组合检索能力。

Result: 方法结合VLM的语义对齐能力和MLLM的推理能力，提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: MVFT-JI通过联合任务优化和推理策略，显著提升了复杂视觉变换下的检索效果。

Abstract: Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train
adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are
concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in
pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large
pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible
tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly
optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the
composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval
performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual
transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM
Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a
pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two
complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval
taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our
method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval
capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and
empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM
to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by
integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images,
and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy
effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Accurately delineating the visual pathway (VP) is crucial for understanding
the human visual system and diagnosing related disorders. Exploring
multi-parametric MR imaging data has been identified as an important way to
delineate VP. However, due to the complex cross-sequence relationships,
existing methods cannot effectively model the complementary information from
different MRI sequences. In addition, these existing methods heavily rely on
large training data with labels, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to
obtain. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-parametric
feature decomposition framework for VP delineation. Specifically, a
correlation-constrained feature decomposition (CFD) is designed to handle the
complex cross-sequence relationships by capturing the unique characteristics of
each MRI sequence and easing the multi-parametric information fusion process.
Furthermore, a consistency-based sample enhancement (CSE) module is developed
to address the limited labeled data issue, by generating and promoting
meaningful edge information from unlabeled data. We validate our framework
using two public datasets, and one in-house Multi-Shell Diffusion MRI (MDM)
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in
terms of delineation performance when compared to seven state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 人像图像在传输中常受运动模糊和通用噪声的共同影响，现有研究对此关注不足，因此需要一种更有效的恢复方法。

Method: 设计了模拟运动模糊和噪声共存的退化管道，提出三重分支双提示引导（DPG），利用高质量图像、残差噪声和运动模糊分割掩码作为训练目标。

Conclusion: HAODiff通过自适应双提示引导有效提升了图像恢复的鲁棒性，为复杂退化场景提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-centered images often suffer from severe generic degradation during
transmission and are prone to human motion blur (HMB), making restoration
challenging. Existing research lacks sufficient focus on these issues, as both
problems often coexist in practice. To address this, we design a degradation
pipeline that simulates the coexistence of HMB and generic noise, generating
synthetic degraded data to train our proposed HAODiff, a human-aware one-step
diffusion. Specifically, we propose a triple-branch dual-prompt guidance (DPG),
which leverages high-quality images, residual noise (LQ minus HQ), and HMB
segmentation masks as training targets. It produces a positive-negative prompt
pair for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in a single diffusion step. The
resulting adaptive dual prompts let HAODiff exploit CFG more effectively,
boosting robustness against diverse degradations. For fair evaluation, we
introduce MPII-Test, a benchmark rich in combined noise and HMB cases.
Extensive experiments show that our HAODiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality on
synthetic and real-world datasets, including our introduced MPII-Test. Code is

Conclusion: GAN生成的数据增强在生物医学图像分析中具有潜力，尤其适用于标注数据有限的领域。

Abstract: Accurate identification of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in endomyocardial
biopsies is essential for effective management of heart transplant patients.
However, the rarity of high-grade rejection cases (3R) presents a significant
challenge for training robust deep learning models. This work addresses the
class imbalance problem by leveraging synthetic data generation using StyleGAN
to augment the limited number of real 3R images. Prior to GAN training,
histogram equalization was applied to standardize image appearance and improve
the consistency of tissue representation. StyleGAN was trained on available 3R
biopsy patches and subsequently used to generate 10,000 realistic synthetic
images. These were combined with real 0R samples, that is samples without
rejection, in various configurations to train ResNet-18 classifiers for binary
rejection classification.
  Three classifier variants were evaluated: one trained on real 0R and
synthetic 3R images, another using both synthetic and additional real samples,
and a third trained solely on real data. All models were tested on an
independent set of real biopsy images. Results demonstrate that synthetic data
improves classification performance, particularly when used in combination with
real samples. The highest-performing model, which used both real and synthetic
images, achieved strong precision and recall for both classes. These findings
underscore the value of hybrid training strategies and highlight the potential
of GAN-based data augmentation in biomedical image analysis, especially in
domains constrained by limited annotated datasets.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present our solution to the CVPR 2025 Visual
Anomaly and Novelty Detection (VAND) 3.0 Workshop Challenge Track 1: Adapt &
Detect: Robust Anomaly Detection in Real-World Applications. In real-world
industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies
with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces,
occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2
dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and
anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the
challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting
conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully
training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature
extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a
small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by
leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then
segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features
and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets
of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition aims at separating an image into its underlying
albedo and shading components, isolating the base color from lighting effects
to enable downstream applications such as virtual relighting and scene editing.
Despite the rise and success of learning-based approaches, intrinsic image
decomposition from real-world images remains a significant challenging task due
to the scarcity of labeled ground-truth data. Most existing solutions rely on
synthetic data as supervised setups, limiting their ability to generalize to
real-world scenes. Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, often produce
albedo maps that contain reflections and lack consistency under different
lighting conditions. To address this, we propose SAIL, an approach designed to
estimate albedo-like representations from single-view real-world images. We
repurpose the prior knowledge of a latent diffusion model for unconditioned
scene relighting as a surrogate objective for albedo estimation. To extract the
albedo, we introduce a novel intrinsic image decomposition fully formulated in
the latent space. To guide the training of our latent diffusion model, we
introduce regularization terms that constrain both the lighting-dependent and
independent components of our latent image decomposition. SAIL predicts stable
albedo under varying lighting conditions and generalizes to multiple scenes,
using only unlabeled multi-illumination data available online.

Motivation: 现有方法在高分辨率图像渲染中计算密集，而自然场景通常是分段平滑的，因此需要一种更高效的采样策略以减少冗余计算。

Method: 采用深度引导的束采样策略，将相邻光线分组并共享表示，同时根据深度置信度动态分配样本。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，PSNR提升1.27 dB，FPS增加47%，渲染速度比现有方法快2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时显著提升了效率，适用于合成和真实场景数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generalizable novel view synthesis have achieved
impressive quality through interpolation between nearby views. However,
rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the
need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are
typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant, we propose
a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By
grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively, a shared
representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further
optimize efficiency, our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates
samples based on depth confidence, concentrating more samples in complex
regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF, our
method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on
the DTU dataset. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering quality and up to 2x faster rendering
compared to existing generalizable methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: ViT-P无需预训练即可适配多种ViT模型，且能通过粗标注降低标注成本，性能优越。

Abstract: Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding
robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches
yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately
classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and
imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask
generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to
produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a
point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to
refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a
pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained
vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability
to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding
box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring
additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs
while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO,
ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving
state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4
mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic

Conclusion: EQ-Reg为非严格等变网络提供了一种简单有效的自适应机制，适用于图像恢复任务。

Abstract: Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit
intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in
certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited
representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not
hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image
restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry
representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant
regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry
constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational
accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance
rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of
data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved
through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel
shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly
enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration,
providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on
task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the
superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The design of convolutional neural architectures that are exactly equivariant
to continuous translations is an active field of research. It promises to
benefit scientific computing, notably by making existing imaging systems more
physically accurate. Most efforts focus on the design of downsampling/pooling
layers, upsampling layers and activation functions, but little attention is
dedicated to normalization layers. In this work, we present a novel theoretical
framework for understanding the equivariance of normalization layers to
discrete shifts and continuous translations. We also determine necessary and
sufficient conditions for normalization layers to be equivariant in terms of
the dimensions they operate on. Using real feature maps from ResNet-18 and
ImageNet, we test those theoretical results empirically and find that they are
consistent with our predictions.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces
Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free
alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input.
EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task
adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive
computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression
mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context
multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By
adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence
constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity
without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly
integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context
learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world
applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks
demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive
long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a
groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal
models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at

learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a
large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views,
these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To
address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature
Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable
neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with
efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it
integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling
high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention
weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based
neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT
achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views,
highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. Code is

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效减少标注需求，提升语义分割模型的性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and
autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the
labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation
methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data
have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic
segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In
this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the
quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on
the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with
annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot
annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified
Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels
to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets:
PASCAL and MS COCO.

*Miaoyu Li,Qin Chao,Boyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Causal2Needles基准，评估视频语言模型在长视频中提取和联合理解信息的能力，以及因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能充分评估视频语言模型在长视频中的信息提取和因果推理能力。

Method: 设计2-needle问题，要求从长视频中提取因果事件信息，并通过两种互补格式避免文本偏差。

Result: 现有模型在2-needle视觉定位任务中表现不佳，性能与事件距离负相关。

Conclusion: 当前视频语言模型在长视频理解和因果推理方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the video understanding capabilities of Video-Language Models
(VLMs) remains a significant challenge. We propose a long-context video
understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities
insufficiently evaluated by existing benchmarks: (1) the ability to extract
information from two separate locations in a long video and understand them
jointly, and (2) the ability to model the world in terms of cause and effect in
human behaviors. Specifically, Causal2Needles introduces 2-needle questions,
which require extracting information from both the cause and effect
human-behavior events in a long video and the associated narration text. To
prevent textual bias, these questions comprise two complementary formats: one
asking to identify the video clip containing the answer, and one asking for the
textual description of an unrelated visual detail from that video clip. Our
experiments reveal that models excelling in pre-existing benchmarks struggle
with 2-needle visual grounding, and the model performance is negatively
correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight
critical limitations in current VLMs.

TL;DR: Sparse2DGS是一种改进的3D重建方法，通过结合DUSt3R和COLMAP MVS，仅需三张图像即可实现高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GS方法需要大量多视角图像，而Sparse2DGS旨在解决在输入图像有限时重建精度下降的问题。

Method: 使用DUSt3R和COLMAP MVS生成高精度密集点云，用于初始化2D高斯。

Result: 在DTU数据集上验证，仅用三张图像即可准确重建物体3D形状。

Conclusion: Sparse2DGS在稀疏输入条件下显著提升了重建精度。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method
for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using
multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However,
GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and
therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a
limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the
insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through
Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for
optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method,
called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three
images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along
with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which
are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU
dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of
objects using just three images.

Conclusion: UniVF和VF-Bench为视频融合任务提供了有效的解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: The real world is dynamic, yet most image fusion methods process static
frames independently, ignoring temporal correlations in videos and leading to
flickering and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we propose Unified
Video Fusion (UniVF), a novel framework for temporally coherent video fusion
that leverages multi-frame learning and optical flow-based feature warping for
informative, temporally coherent video fusion. To support its development, we
also introduce Video Fusion Benchmark (VF-Bench), the first comprehensive
benchmark covering four video fusion tasks: multi-exposure, multi-focus,
infrared-visible, and medical fusion. VF-Bench provides high-quality,
well-aligned video pairs obtained through synthetic data generation and
rigorous curation from existing datasets, with a unified evaluation protocol
that jointly assesses the spatial quality and temporal consistency of video
fusion. Extensive experiments show that UniVF achieves state-of-the-art results

TL;DR: FruitNeRF++是一种结合对比学习和神经辐射场的新型水果计数方法，通过实例掩码和神经实例场实现多水果计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FruitNeRF方法需针对每种水果类型调整，限制了实用性，因此设计了一种形状无关的多水果计数框架。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型预测实例掩码，将实例嵌入编码到神经实例场中，通过体积采样提取点云并聚类计数。

Result: 在合成和真实苹果数据集上验证，FruitNeRF++更易控制且优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: FruitNeRF++解决了FruitNeRF的局限性，提供了一种更通用的水果计数解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce FruitNeRF++, a novel fruit-counting approach that combines
contrastive learning with neural radiance fields to count fruits from
unstructured input photographs of orchards. Our work is based on FruitNeRF,
which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering
approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the
applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift
this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework,
that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a
vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each
fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically
sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance
features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit
count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples,
plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark
apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control
and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了训练无关技术（如CFG和FreeU）在Score Distillation Sampling（SDS）中的应用，发现CFG和FreeU的尺度调整分别影响物体大小与表面平滑度、纹理细节与几何误差的权衡，并提出动态调整策略以优化文本到3D生成的效果。

Motivation: 研究训练无关技术在SDS中的影响，以提升文本到3D生成的质量。

Method: 通过调整CFG和FreeU的尺度，分析其对SDS的影响，并提出动态调整策略。

Result: CFG尺度影响物体大小与表面平滑度，FreeU尺度影响纹理细节与几何误差；动态调整策略能平衡纹理细节与表面平滑度。

Conclusion: 动态调整训练无关技术的尺度可优化文本到3D生成效果，减少几何缺陷并保持输出尺寸。

Abstract: Recent studies show that simple training-free techniques can dramatically
improve the quality of text-to-2D generation outputs, e.g. Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) or FreeU. However, these training-free techniques have been
underexplored in the lens of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which is a
popular and effective technique to leverage the power of pretrained text-to-2D
diffusion models for various tasks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the
effect such training-free techniques have on SDS, via a particular application
of text-to-3D generation via 2D lifting. We present our findings, which show
that varying the scales of CFG presents a trade-off between object size and
surface smoothness, while varying the scales of FreeU presents a trade-off
between texture details and geometric errors. Based on these findings, we
provide insights into how we can effectively harness training-free techniques
for SDS, via a strategic scaling of such techniques in a dynamic manner with
respect to the timestep or optimization iteration step. We show that using our
proposed scheme strikes a favorable balance between texture details and surface
smoothness in text-to-3D generations, while preserving the size of the output
and mitigating the occurrence of geometric defects.

TL;DR: Deep Spectral Prior (DSP) 是一种基于频域对齐的图像重建方法，通过匹配傅里叶系数避免传统 Deep Image Prior (DIP) 的过拟合问题，并引入频谱一致性偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 DIP 依赖像素级损失和早停来防止过拟合，但效果有限。DSP 旨在通过频域对齐直接解决这一问题，利用图像的已知频率结构和卷积神经网络的频谱偏置。

Method: DSP 将图像重建定义为频域对齐问题，直接匹配网络输出与观测数据的傅里叶系数，作为隐式频谱正则化器。

Result: 理论分析表明 DSP 具有平滑收敛性、局部稳定性和良好的偏差-方差权衡。实验证明其在去噪、修复和超分辨率任务中优于传统 DIP 和其他无监督基线。

Conclusion: DSP 通过频域对齐和频谱一致性提升了图像重建的鲁棒性和可解释性，无需依赖早停，且在多任务中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Spectral Prior (DSP), a new formulation of Deep Image Prior
(DIP) that redefines image reconstruction as a frequency-domain alignment
problem. Unlike traditional DIP, which relies on pixel-wise loss and early
stopping to mitigate overfitting, DSP directly matches Fourier coefficients
between the network output and observed measurements. This shift introduces an
explicit inductive bias towards spectral coherence, aligning with the known
frequency structure of images and the spectral bias of convolutional neural
networks. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that DSP
acts as an implicit spectral regulariser, suppressing high-frequency noise by
design and eliminating the need for early stopping. Our analysis spans four
core dimensions establishing smooth convergence dynamics, local stability, and
favourable bias-variance tradeoffs. We further show that DSP naturally projects
reconstructions onto a frequency-consistent manifold, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. These theoretical guarantees are supported by
empirical results across denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks,
where DSP consistently outperforms classical DIP and other unsupervised
baselines.

Motivation: 风格对齐文本到图像生成需要大量特定风格的三元组数据，获取难度大。

Result: 实验证明StyleAR在风格对齐生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: StyleAR通过创新数据利用和模型设计，有效解决了风格对齐生成中的数据挑战。

Abstract: In the current research landscape, multimodal autoregressive (AR) models have
shown exceptional capabilities across various domains, including visual
understanding and generation. However, complex tasks such as style-aligned
text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data
acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR
models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt,
resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style
and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet
data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining
conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address
this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a
specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to
effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image
generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style
image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image
modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data
training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that
translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in
AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content
leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw
images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to
enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style
consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our
superior performance.

Conclusion: Vad-R1通过深度推理和自验证机制，显著提升了视频异常分析能力，为MLLMs在复杂视觉任务中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) demonstrate its effectiveness in tackling complex visual tasks.
However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain
limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper,
we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable
deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to
think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an
end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a
Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human
process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly
step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a
dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement
learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly
reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with
limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves
superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on
VAD and VAR tasks. Codes and datasets will be released at

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，ErpGS渲染新视角图像的精度优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ErpGS有效解决了360度相机图像重建中的畸变问题，提升了渲染质量。

Abstract: The use of multi-view images acquired by a 360-degree camera can reconstruct
a 3D space with a wide area. There are 3D reconstruction methods from
equirectangular images based on NeRF and 3DGS, as well as Novel View Synthesis
(NVS) methods. On the other hand, it is necessary to overcome the large
distortion caused by the projection model of a 360-degree camera when
equirectangular images are used. In 3DGS-based methods, the large distortion of
the 360-degree camera model generates extremely large 3D Gaussians, resulting
in poor rendering accuracy. We propose ErpGS, which is Omnidirectional GS based
on 3DGS to realize NVS addressing the problems. ErpGS introduce some rendering
accuracy improvement techniques: geometric regularization, scale
regularization, and distortion-aware weights and a mask to suppress the effects
of obstacles in equirectangular images. Through experiments on public datasets,
we demonstrate that ErpGS can render novel view images more accurately than
conventional methods.

Abstract: Current video-based fall detection research mostly relies on small, staged

under a consistent ten-class taxonomy with standardized evaluation protocols.
Our benchmark provides complete video segmentation labels and enables fair
cross-dataset comparison previously impossible with incompatible annotation
schemes. For real-world evaluation we curate OOPS-Fall from genuine accident
videos and establish a staged-to-wild protocol measuring generalization from
controlled to uncontrolled environments. Experiments with frozen pre-trained

in-distribution and in-the-wild scenarios, highlighting critical challenges in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光线吸收、散射等问题质量下降，现有方法依赖合成数据且易产生偏差，需改进。

Method: 结合扩散模型、CLIP分类器、空间注意力模块和CLIP-Diffusion损失函数，增强图像并保持语义一致性。

Result: 模型能有效校正失真，恢复自然外观，定量和定性评估均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UDAN-CLIP在水下图像增强中表现优异，视觉和语义效果均显著提升。

Abstract: Underwater images are often affected by complex degradations such as light
absorption, scattering, color casts, and artifacts, making enhancement critical
for effective object detection, recognition, and scene understanding in aquatic
environments. Existing methods, especially diffusion-based approaches,
typically rely on synthetic paired datasets due to the scarcity of real
underwater references, introducing bias and limiting generalization.
Furthermore, fine-tuning these models can degrade learned priors, resulting in
unrealistic enhancements due to domain shifts. To address these challenges, we
propose UDAN-CLIP, an image-to-image diffusion framework pre-trained on
synthetic underwater datasets and enhanced with a customized classifier based
on vision-language model, a spatial attention module, and a novel
CLIP-Diffusion loss. The classifier preserves natural in-air priors and
semantically guides the diffusion process, while the spatial attention module
focuses on correcting localized degradations such as haze and low contrast. The
proposed CLIP-Diffusion loss further strengthens visual-textual alignment and
helps maintain semantic consistency during enhancement. The proposed
contributions empower our UDAN-CLIP model to perform more effective underwater
image enhancement, producing results that are not only visually compelling but
also more realistic and detail-preserving. These improvements are consistently
validated through both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual comparisons,
demonstrating the model's ability to correct distortions and restore natural
appearance in challenging underwater conditions.

Conclusion: Dynamic-I2V在图像到视频生成中达到最先进性能，并通过DIVE基准解决了现有评估偏差问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image-to-video (I2V) generation have shown promising
performance in conventional scenarios. However, these methods still encounter
significant challenges when dealing with complex scenes that require a deep
understanding of nuanced motion and intricate object-action relationships. To
address these challenges, we present Dynamic-I2V, an innovative framework that
integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to jointly encode visual
and textual conditions for a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture. By
leveraging the advanced multimodal understanding capabilities of MLLMs, our
model significantly improves motion controllability and temporal coherence in
synthesized videos. The inherent multimodality of Dynamic-I2V further enables
flexible support for diverse conditional inputs, extending its applicability to
various downstream generation tasks. Through systematic analysis, we identify a
critical limitation in current I2V benchmarks: a significant bias towards
favoring low-dynamic videos, stemming from an inadequate balance between motion
complexity and visual quality metrics. To resolve this evaluation gap, we
propose DIVE - a novel assessment benchmark specifically designed for
comprehensive dynamic quality measurement in I2V generation. In conclusion,
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments confirm that Dynamic-I2V
attains state-of-the-art performance in image-to-video generation, particularly
revealing significant improvements of 42.5%, 7.9%, and 11.8% in dynamic range,
controllability, and quality, respectively, as assessed by the DIVE metric in

Conclusion: VMA展示了VLM的对抗脆弱性，同时为攻击与防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
understanding complex real-world scenarios and supporting data-driven
decision-making processes. However, VLMs exhibit significant vulnerability
against adversarial examples, either text or image, which can lead to various
adversarial outcomes, e.g., jailbreaking, hijacking, and hallucination, etc. In
this work, we empirically and theoretically demonstrate that VLMs are
particularly susceptible to image-based adversarial examples, where
imperceptible perturbations can precisely manipulate each output token. To this
end, we propose a novel attack called Vision-language model Manipulation Attack
(VMA), which integrates first-order and second-order momentum optimization
techniques with a differentiable transformation mechanism to effectively
optimize the adversarial perturbation. Notably, VMA can be a double-edged
sword: it can be leveraged to implement various attacks, such as jailbreaking,
hijacking, privacy breaches, Denial-of-Service, and the generation of sponge
examples, etc, while simultaneously enabling the injection of watermarks for
copyright protection. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy
and generalizability of VMA across diverse scenarios and datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架高效且实用，适用于数字孪生、VR/AR等场景。

Abstract: For tasks such as urban digital twins, VR/AR/game scene design, or creating
synthetic films, the traditional industrial approach often involves manually
modeling scenes and using various rendering engines to complete the rendering
process. This approach typically requires high labor costs and hardware
demands, and can result in poor quality when replicating complex real-world
scenes. A more efficient approach is to use data from captured real-world
scenes, then apply reconstruction and rendering algorithms to quickly recreate
the authentic scene. However, current algorithms are unable to effectively
reconstruct and render real-world weather effects. To address this, we propose
a framework based on gaussian splatting, that can reconstruct real scenes and
render them under synthesized 4D weather effects. Our work can simulate various
common weather effects by applying Gaussians modeling and rendering techniques.
It supports continuous dynamic weather changes and can easily control the
details of the effects. Additionally, our work has low hardware requirements
and achieves real-time rendering performance. The result demos can be accessed

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的模型-模板（MOTE）方法，用小型个性化神经网络替代传统的向量人脸模板，以提升公平性和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统依赖固定的人脸表示（模板），缺乏可解释性，且存在公平性和隐私问题。

Method: MOTE为每个身份创建专用的二元分类器，仅使用单个参考样本和合成平衡样本进行训练，以调整公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公平性和隐私保护方面有显著提升，但增加了推理时间和存储需求。

Conclusion: MOTE为中小规模应用中注重公平性和隐私的场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional face recognition systems rely on extracting fixed face
representations, known as templates, to store and verify identities. These
representations are typically generated by neural networks that often lack
explainability and raise concerns regarding fairness and privacy. In this work,
we propose a novel model-template (MOTE) approach that replaces vector-based
face templates with small personalized neural networks. This design enables
more responsible face recognition for small and medium-scale systems. During
enrollment, MOTE creates a dedicated binary classifier for each identity,
trained to determine whether an input face matches the enrolled identity. Each
classifier is trained using only a single reference sample, along with
synthetically balanced samples to allow adjusting fairness at the level of a
single individual during enrollment. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets and recognition systems demonstrate substantial improvements in
fairness and particularly in privacy. Although the method increases inference
time and storage requirements, it presents a strong solution for small- and
mid-scale applications where fairness and privacy are critical.

Motivation: 当前音频-视觉零样本学习方法存在背景场景偏差和运动细节不足的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来解耦语义信息和动态运动信息。

Method: 提出MDST++，通过解耦上下文语义信息和稀疏动态运动信息，利用循环联合学习单元提取语义信息，并通过事件捕捉运动信息。引入差异分析块建模音频运动信息，并动态调整LIF神经元的阈值。

Result: 实验表明MDST++在主流基准测试中优于现有方法，运动和多时间尺度信息的引入使HM和ZSL准确率分别提升26.2%和39.9%。

Conclusion: MDST++通过解耦语义和运动信息，有效解决了背景偏差和运动细节不足问题，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been extensively researched for its
capability to classify video data from unseen classes during training.
Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases
and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream
Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples
contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The
recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic
information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand
the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method
captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene
biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio
motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal
and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic
information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++,
demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on
mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale
information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多VLMs无法识别图像中的边缘，作者假设这是由于过度依赖文本和位置偏见导致，希望通过消除这些偏见来提升边缘识别能力。

Method: 通过对比学习在人工生成的图表-标题数据集上训练图像编码器，并在探测、图像检索和标题生成任务中评估其性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在所有任务中均优于预训练的CLIP，并在标题生成任务中超越了零样本的GPT-4o和LLaVA-Mistral。

Conclusion: 消除文本和位置偏见能显著提升VLMs的边缘识别能力，为图表理解提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The diagram is a visual representation of a relationship illustrated with
edges (lines or arrows), which is widely used in industrial and scientific
communication. Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language
models (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal
that many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these
failures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,
preventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we
empirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge
representation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased
neither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct
contrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to
train an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three
tasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the
finetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses
zero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task. These findings
confirm that eliminating textual and positional biases fosters accurate edge
recognition in VLMs, offering a promising path for advancing diagram
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SaSi的深度学习方法，用于解决冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）中少量标记数据下的粒子检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描（cryo-ET）在近原生状态下成像大分子复合物时，由于低信噪比和缺失楔形伪影，3D粒子定位仍具挑战性。现有深度学习方法需要大量数据，而标记数据稀缺。

Method: 提出自增强和自解释（SaSi）深度学习框架，通过自增强技术提高数据利用率，并引入自解释分割策略减少对标记数据的依赖。

Result: 在模拟和真实cryo-ET数据集上的实验表明，SaSi方法显著优于现有最先进的粒子定位方法。

Conclusion: SaSi方法为冷冻电子断层扫描中的少量标记数据粒子检测提供了新思路，并树立了结构生物学中少样本学习的新标杆。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful technique for
imaging macromolecular complexes in their near-native states. However, the
localization of 3D particles in cellular environments still presents a
significant challenge due to low signal-to-noise ratios and missing wedge
artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown great potential, but they need
huge amounts of data, which can be a challenge in cryo-ET scenarios where
labeled data is often scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-augmented
and Self-interpreted (SaSi) deep learning approach towards few-shot particle
detection in 3D cryo-ET images. Our method builds upon self-augmentation
techniques to further boost data utilization and introduces a self-interpreted
segmentation strategy for alleviating dependency on labeled data, hence
improving generalization and robustness. As demonstrated by experiments
conducted on both simulated and real-world cryo-ET datasets, the SaSi approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for particle
localization. This research increases understanding of how to detect particles
with very few labels in cryo-ET and thus sets a new benchmark for few-shot
learning in structural biology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型框架MRA，用于零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR），通过直接构建三元组消除对文本中介的依赖，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖生成的中间文本，导致错误传播和检索性能下降，需改进。

Method: 使用多模态推理代理（MRA）直接构建三元组（参考图像、修改文本、目标图像），并通过无标注图像数据训练模型。

Result: 在三个标准CIR基准测试中表现优异，FashionIQ数据集R@10提升7.5%，CIRR R@1提升9.6%，CIRCO mAP@5提升9.5%。

Conclusion: MRA框架有效解决了文本中介带来的问题，显著提升了零样本组合图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images
given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying
text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often
generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as
an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image.
Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated
text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using
contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces
error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings
accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these
problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning
Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries
by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target
image>, using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic
triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional
queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard
CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ
dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing
baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by
9.5\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在视频超分辨率（VSR）中因随机性和缺乏时间建模而面临挑战。

Method: 提出DRS将迭代去噪过程转化为单步重建，并设计RTS模块通过特征传播和融合确保时间一致性。结合Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation（SJD）和Temporally Asynchronous Inference（TAI）策略优化性能。

Result: UltraVSR在单步采样中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持时间一致性和细节真实性。

Conclusion: UltraVSR为视频超分辨率提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，显著提升了扩散模型在VSR中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image
detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains
challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling.
In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables
ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step
diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware
Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the
low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a
single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos.
This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds
up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet
effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution
unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along
the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective
feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without
relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a
pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through
Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence
while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally
Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal
dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that
UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, in a single sampling step.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为渐进层次指令（PHI）的方法，通过Gap Minimization Flow（GMF）和List-wise Contrastive Regularization（LCR）策略，解决了长期动作质量评估（AQA）中的领域偏移问题，并在实验中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长期AQA任务中因预训练模型与特定任务间的领域偏移（任务级和特征级）而表现不佳，且难以在小数据集上微调大型模型。

Method: 提出PHI方法，包含GMF（通过流匹配减少特征级领域偏移）和LCR（通过列表对比正则化实现粗到细对齐），并结合时间增强注意力模块。

Result: 在三个长期AQA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PHI有效解决了长期AQA中的领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative
performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face
challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action
recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their
performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on
small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of
domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and
feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level
shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical
Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF)
leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces
the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep
layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures
long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive
Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively
comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift.
Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments
demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing
the domain shift for long-term AQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在小规模数据上表现不如CNN，希望通过初始化策略使其兼具CNN和ViT的优势。

Method: 改进ViT初始化策略，使用随机脉冲滤波器模拟CNN的归纳偏置，而非依赖预训练模型或注意力权重分布。

Result: 在Food-101、CIFAR等小规模数据集上显著优于标准ViT初始化，ImageNet-1K上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松集成到多种Transformer架构中，性能一致提升。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) inherently encode strong inductive
biases, enabling effective generalization on small-scale datasets. In this
paper, we propose integrating this inductive bias into ViTs, not through an
architectural intervention but solely through initialization. The motivation
here is to have a ViT that can enjoy strong CNN-like performance when data
assets are small, but can still scale to ViT-like performance as the data
expands. Our approach is motivated by our empirical results that random impulse
filters can achieve commensurate performance to learned filters within a CNN.
We improve upon current ViT initialization strategies, which typically rely on
empirical heuristics such as using attention weights from pretrained models or
focusing on the distribution of attention weights without enforcing structures.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
standard ViT initialization across numerous small and medium-scale benchmarks,
including Food-101, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Flowers, and Pets, while
maintaining comparative performance on large-scale datasets such as
ImageNet-1K. Moreover, our initialization strategy can be easily integrated
into various transformer-based architectures such as Swin Transformer and
MLP-Mixer with consistent improvements in performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual
object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data
volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical
study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements
in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and
limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training,
a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and
dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks,
demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to
additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.

Result: 显著降低了MLLMs在多模态语义生成中的未知识别率，提升了生成文本质量。

Conclusion: NEXT框架通过语义和结构分支的解耦，实现了多模态对象重识别的有效建模。

Abstract: Multi-modal object re-identification (ReID) aims to extract identity features
across heterogeneous spectral modalities to enable accurate recognition and
retrieval in complex real-world scenarios. However, most existing methods rely
on implicit feature fusion structures, making it difficult to model
fine-grained recognition strategies under varying challenging conditions.
Benefiting from the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), the visual appearance of an object can be
effectively translated into descriptive text. In this paper, we propose a
reliable multi-modal caption generation method based on attribute confidence,
which significantly reduces the unknown recognition rate of MLLMs in
multi-modal semantic generation and improves the quality of generated text.
Additionally, we propose a novel ReID framework NEXT, the Multi-grained Mixture
of Experts via Text-Modulation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification.
Specifically, we decouple the recognition problem into semantic and structural
expert branches to separately capture modality-specific appearance and
intrinsic structure. For semantic recognition, we propose the Text-Modulated
Semantic-sampling Experts (TMSE), which leverages randomly sampled high-quality
semantic texts to modulate expert-specific sampling of multi-modal features and
mining intra-modality fine-grained semantic cues. Then, to recognize
coarse-grained structure features, we propose the Context-Shared
Structure-aware Experts (CSSE) that focuses on capturing the holistic object
structure across modalities and maintains inter-modality structural consistency
through a soft routing mechanism. Finally, we propose the Multi-Modal Feature
Aggregation (MMFA), which adopts a unified feature fusion strategy to simply
and effectively integrate semantic and structural expert outputs into the final
identity representations.

Conclusion: 结论指出需要开发专门的数据集来提升VLMs在原子视觉任务上的能力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with
trivially simple visual tasks. In this work, we focus on the domain of basic 2D
Euclidean geometry and systematically categorize the fundamental, indivisible
visual perception skills, which we refer to as atomic visual skills. We then
introduce the Atomic Visual Skills Dataset (AVSD) for evaluating VLMs on the
atomic visual skills. Using AVSD, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs and find
that they struggle with these tasks, despite being trivial for adult humans.
Our findings highlight the need for purpose-built datasets to train and
evaluate VLMs on atomic, rather than composite, visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities,
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in
the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to
closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have
not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In
this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed
for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next
Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This
dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with
actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded
decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset,
namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method
outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of
19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan
demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark,
highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉和触觉模态融合及跨任务泛化方面存在不足，且忽视了多尺度空间推理的重要性。

Method: 提出ViTaPEs框架，利用多尺度位置编码捕获模态内结构和跨模态线索，并提供可证明的融合保证。

Result: 在多个大规模数据集上超越现有方法，并展示了零样本泛化和迁移学习能力。

Conclusion: ViTaPEs为视觉触觉感知提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Tactile sensing provides local essential information that is complementary to
visual perception, such as texture, compliance, and force. Despite recent
advances in visuotactile representation learning, challenges remain in fusing
these modalities and generalizing across tasks and environments without heavy
reliance on pre-trained vision-language models. Moreover, existing methods do
not study positional encodings, thereby overlooking the multi-scale spatial
reasoning needed to capture fine-grained visuotactile correlations. We
introduce ViTaPEs, a transformer-based framework that robustly integrates
visual and tactile input data to learn task-agnostic representations for
visuotactile perception. Our approach exploits a novel multi-scale positional
encoding scheme to capture intra-modal structures, while simultaneously
modeling cross-modal cues. Unlike prior work, we provide provable guarantees in
visuotactile fusion, showing that our encodings are injective,
rigid-motion-equivariant, and information-preserving, validating these
properties empirically. Experiments on multiple large-scale real-world datasets
show that ViTaPEs not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across various
recognition tasks but also demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen,
out-of-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the transfer-learning strength
of ViTaPEs in a robotic grasping task, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in predicting grasp success. Project page:

Method: 引入 EmoNet Face，包括 40 类情感分类、三个大规模 AI 生成数据集（EmoNet HQ、Binary 和 Big），以及多专家标注的高保真评估。

Result: 开发了 Empathic Insight Face 模型，在基准测试中达到人类专家水平。

Conclusion: EmoNet Face 为开发更深入理解人类情感的 AI 系统提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI interaction relies on AI's ability to accurately perceive
and interpret human emotions. Current benchmarks for vision and vision-language
models are severely limited, offering a narrow emotional spectrum that
overlooks nuanced states (e.g., bitterness, intoxication) and fails to
distinguish subtle differences between related feelings (e.g., shame vs.
embarrassment). Existing datasets also often use uncontrolled imagery with
occluded faces and lack demographic diversity, risking significant bias. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce EmoNet Face, a comprehensive
benchmark suite. EmoNet Face features: (1) A novel 40-category emotion
taxonomy, meticulously derived from foundational research to capture finer
details of human emotional experiences. (2) Three large-scale, AI-generated
datasets (EmoNet HQ, Binary, and Big) with explicit, full-face expressions and
controlled demographic balance across ethnicity, age, and gender. (3) Rigorous,
multi-expert annotations for training and high-fidelity evaluation. (4) We
build Empathic Insight Face, a model achieving human-expert-level performance
on our benchmark. The publicly released EmoNet Face suite - taxonomy, datasets,
and model - provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating AI
systems with a deeper understanding of human emotions.

TL;DR: DepthMatch是一种半监督学习框架，用于RGB-D场景解析，通过补丁混合增强和空间先验注入器提升性能，并在NYUv2和KITTI数据集上取得领先结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D场景解析方法依赖大量手动标注数据，成本高且耗时，因此提出半监督学习框架以利用未标注数据。

Method: 提出补丁混合增强探索RGB-D图像对的潜在关系，设计轻量级空间先验注入器优化特征融合，并引入深度引导边界损失提升边界预测能力。

Result: DepthMatch在室内外场景均表现优异，在NYUv2数据集上达到SOTA，并在KITTI语义基准中排名第一。

Conclusion: DepthMatch通过半监督学习和高效特征融合，显著降低了标注需求并提升了RGB-D场景解析性能。

Abstract: RGB-D scene parsing methods effectively capture both semantic and geometric
features of the environment, demonstrating great potential under challenging
conditions such as extreme weather and low lighting. However, existing RGB-D
scene parsing methods predominantly rely on supervised training strategies,
which require a large amount of manually annotated pixel-level labels that are
both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
DepthMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework that is specifically designed
for RGB-D scene parsing. To make full use of unlabeled data, we propose
complementary patch mix-up augmentation to explore the latent relationships
between texture and spatial features in RGB-D image pairs. We also design a
lightweight spatial prior injector to replace traditional complex fusion
modules, improving the efficiency of heterogeneous feature fusion. Furthermore,
we introduce depth-guided boundary loss to enhance the model's boundary
prediction capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DepthMatch
exhibits high applicability in both indoor and outdoor scenes, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the NYUv2 dataset and ranking first on the KITTI
Semantics benchmark.

Result: 在两个常用手势识别数据集上，PGPFR的平均全局准确率分别比现有方法高出11.8%和12.8%。

Conclusion: PGPFR框架在类增量手势识别任务中表现出色，有效解决了新类适应和旧类遗忘的问题。

Abstract: Gesture recognition is an important research area in the field of computer
vision. Most gesture recognition efforts focus on close-set scenarios, thereby
limiting the capacity to effectively handle unseen or novel gestures. We aim to
address class-incremental gesture recognition, which entails the ability to
accommodate new and previously unseen gestures over time. Specifically, we
introduce a Prototype-Guided Pseudo Feature Replay (PGPFR) framework for
data-free class-incremental gesture recognition. This framework comprises four
components: Pseudo Feature Generation with Batch Prototypes (PFGBP),
Variational Prototype Replay (VPR) for old classes, Truncated Cross-Entropy
(TCE) for new classes, and Continual Classifier Re-Training (CCRT). To tackle
the issue of catastrophic forgetting, the PFGBP dynamically generates a
diversity of pseudo features in an online manner, leveraging class prototypes
of old classes along with batch class prototypes of new classes. Furthermore,
the VPR enforces consistency between the classifier's weights and the
prototypes of old classes, leveraging class prototypes and covariance matrices
to enhance robustness and generalization capabilities. The TCE mitigates the
impact of domain differences of the classifier caused by pseudo features.
Finally, the CCRT training strategy is designed to prevent overfitting to new
classes and ensure the stability of features extracted from old classes.
Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used gesture recognition
datasets, namely SHREC 2017 3D and EgoGesture 3D, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 11.8\% and 12.8\% in terms of
mean global accuracy, respectively. The code is available on

<details>

Motivation: 当前扩散模型在推理过程中缺乏可解释的语义监督和修正机制，导致生成图像常出现对象混淆、空间错误等问题。

Result: 实验表明PPAD在极少的扩散步骤中实现语义修正，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义对齐。

Conclusion: PPAD为扩散模型提供了一种高效、通用的语义修正机制，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the mainstream architecture for text-to-image
generation, achieving remarkable progress in visual quality and prompt
controllability. However, current inference pipelines generally lack
interpretable semantic supervision and correction mechanisms throughout the
denoising process. Most existing approaches rely solely on post-hoc scoring of
the final image, prompt filtering, or heuristic resampling strategies-making
them ineffective in providing actionable guidance for correcting the generative
trajectory. As a result, models often suffer from object confusion, spatial
errors, inaccurate counts, and missing semantic elements, severely compromising
prompt-image alignment and image quality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MLLM Semantic-Corrected Ping-Pong-Ahead Diffusion (PPAD), a novel
framework that, for the first time, introduces a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) as a semantic observer during inference. PPAD performs real-time
analysis on intermediate generations, identifies latent semantic
inconsistencies, and translates feedback into controllable signals that
actively guide the remaining denoising steps. The framework supports both
inference-only and training-enhanced settings, and performs semantic correction
at only extremely few diffusion steps, offering strong generality and
scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPAD's significant improvements.

Conclusion: PAMD为舞蹈生成提供了更真实且音乐对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational dance generation is crucial in many areas, such as art,
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and digital entertainment,
particularly for generating coherent and expressive long dance sequences.
Diffusion-based music-to-dance generation has made significant progress, yet
existing methods still struggle to produce physically plausible motions. To
address this, we propose Plausibility-Aware Motion Diffusion (PAMD), a
framework for generating dances that are both musically aligned and physically
realistic. The core of PAMD lies in the Plausible Motion Constraint (PMC),
which leverages Neural Distance Fields (NDFs) to model the actual pose manifold
and guide generated motions toward a physically valid pose manifold. To provide
more effective guidance during generation, we incorporate Prior Motion Guidance
(PMG), which uses standing poses as auxiliary conditions alongside music
features. To further enhance realism for complex movements, we introduce the
Motion Refinement with Foot-ground Contact (MRFC) module, which addresses
foot-skating artifacts by bridging the gap between the optimization objective
in linear joint position space and the data representation in nonlinear
rotation space. Extensive experiments show that PAMD significantly improves
musical alignment and enhances the physical plausibility of generated motions.

Motivation: 解决单目3D手部网格恢复中的高自由度、2D到3D模糊性和自遮挡问题，现有方法效率低或不够直接。

Method: 使用动态螺旋卷积层（DSC）自适应调整权重并提取顶点特征，结合ROI层分区域细化网格顶点。

Result: 在FreiHAND数据集上表现显著优于现有实时方法。

Conclusion: M3DHMR提供了一种高效且直接的单目3D手部网格恢复解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D hand mesh recovery is challenging due to high degrees of freedom
of hands, 2D-to-3D ambiguity and self-occlusion. Most existing methods are
either inefficient or less straightforward for predicting the position of 3D
mesh vertices. Thus, we propose a new pipeline called Monocular 3D Hand Mesh
Recovery (M3DHMR) to directly estimate the positions of hand mesh vertices.
M3DHMR provides 2D cues for 3D tasks from a single image and uses a new spiral
decoder consist of several Dynamic Spiral Convolution (DSC) Layers and a Region
of Interest (ROI) Layer. On the one hand, DSC Layers adaptively adjust the
weights based on the vertex positions and extract the vertex features in both
spatial and channel dimensions. On the other hand, ROI Layer utilizes the
physical information and refines mesh vertices in each predefined hand region
separately. Extensive experiments on popular dataset FreiHAND demonstrate that
M3DHMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出AdaTP方法，通过去偏模块解决视频大语言模型中视觉令牌压缩的注意力偏差问题，显著降低计算开销并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌压缩方法依赖语言模型的注意力分数，但这些分数存在全局和局部偏差，影响模型效率。

Method: 提出AdaTP方法，集成两个去偏模块分别处理全局和局部注意力偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: AdaTP在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，计算开销降至27.3%且性能无损。

Conclusion: AdaTP是一种高效的令牌剪枝方法，适用于视频大语言模型，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in
video understanding tasks. However, they often suffer from heavy computational
overhead due to the large number of visual tokens generated from multiple video
frames. Existing visual token compression methods often rely on attention
scores from language models as guidance. However, these scores exhibit inherent
biases: global bias reflects a tendency to focus on the two ends of the visual
token sequence, while local bias leads to an over-concentration on the same
spatial positions across different frames. To address the issue of attention
bias, we propose $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{D}$ebi$\textbf{a}$sed
$\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{P}$runing for Video Large Language Models
($\textbf{AdaTP}$), a novel token pruning pipeline for Video LLMs. AdaTP
integrates two dedicated debiasing modules into the pipeline, targeting global
attention bias and local attention bias, respectively. Without the need for
additional training, our method significantly reduces the computational
overhead of Video LLMs while retaining the performance of vanilla models.
Extensive evaluation shows that AdaTP achieves state-of-the-art performance in
various commonly used video understanding benchmarks. In particular, on
LLaVA-OneVision-7B, AdaTP maintains performance without degradation while using
only up to $27.3\%$ FLOPs compared to the vanilla model. Our code will be
released soon.

TL;DR: OvSGTR是一种基于Transformer的开放词汇场景图生成框架，克服了传统封闭集模型的限制，通过联合预测对象和关系，支持新概念的识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法局限于固定词汇，无法适应现实世界中频繁出现的新概念，因此需要一种开放词汇的方法来提升场景图生成的通用性。

Method: 采用DETR-like架构，结合冻结的图像主干和文本编码器提取特征，通过Transformer解码器融合特征进行端到端预测。提出关系感知预训练策略和视觉概念保留机制。

Result: 在VG150基准测试中，OvSGTR在多种设置下（包括封闭集、开放词汇等）均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 大规模关系感知预训练和Transformer架构有望推动场景图生成向更通用和可靠的视觉理解发展。

Abstract: We present OvSGTR, a novel transformer-based framework for fully
open-vocabulary scene graph generation that overcomes the limitations of
traditional closed-set models. Conventional methods restrict both object and
relationship recognition to a fixed vocabulary, hindering their applicability
to real-world scenarios where novel concepts frequently emerge. In contrast,
our approach jointly predicts objects (nodes) and their inter-relationships
(edges) beyond predefined categories. OvSGTR leverages a DETR-like architecture
featuring a frozen image backbone and text encoder to extract high-quality
visual and semantic features, which are then fused via a transformer decoder
for end-to-end scene graph prediction. To enrich the model's understanding of
complex visual relations, we propose a relation-aware pre-training strategy
that synthesizes scene graph annotations in a weakly supervised manner.
Specifically, we investigate three pipelines--scene parser-based, LLM-based,
and multimodal LLM-based--to generate transferable supervision signals with
minimal manual annotation. Furthermore, we address the common issue of
catastrophic forgetting in open-vocabulary settings by incorporating a
visual-concept retention mechanism coupled with a knowledge distillation
strategy, ensuring that the model retains rich semantic cues during
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on the VG150 benchmark demonstrate that
OvSGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings,
including closed-set, open-vocabulary object detection-based, relation-based,
and fully open-vocabulary scenarios. Our results highlight the promise of
large-scale relation-aware pre-training and transformer architectures for
advancing scene graph generation towards more generalized and reliable visual
understanding.

Abstract: Videos are unique in their integration of temporal elements, including
camera, scene, action, and attribute, along with their dynamic relationships
over time. However, existing benchmarks for video understanding often treat

videos, with two complementary tasks: captioning and QA. Our TUNA features
diverse video scenarios and dynamics, assisted by interpretable and robust
evaluation criteria. We evaluate several leading models on our benchmark,
providing fine-grained performance assessments across various dimensions. This
evaluation reveals key challenges in video temporal understanding, such as
limited action description, inadequate multi-subject understanding, and
insensitivity to camera motion, offering valuable insights for improving video
understanding models. The data and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance field rendering, exemplified by Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have significantly
progressed 3D modeling and reconstruction. The use of multiple 360-degree
omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to
advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the
inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such
as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying
with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D
reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific
focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to
systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these
omnidirectional-specific challenges. To address this critical gap, we introduce
Omnidirectional Blender 3D (OB3D), a new synthetic dataset curated for
advancing 3D reconstruction from multiple omnidirectional images. OB3D features
diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a
deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides
comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise
omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for
depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics. By offering a controlled yet
challenging environment, OB3Daims to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of
existing methods and prompt the development of new techniques to enhance the
accuracy and reliability of 3D reconstruction from omnidirectional images.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by
vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate
structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains
their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive
simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that
enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by
injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal
input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that
provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud
capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich
spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints.
Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware
working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities
with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on
this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which
the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline
features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment
setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene
hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and
challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior
work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs
to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path
planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in
computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

Conclusion: FUDOKI展示了作为下一代统一多模态模型的潜力，未来可通过强化学习进一步优化。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the
emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that unify visual
understanding and image generation within a single framework. However, most
existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent
limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image
generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In
this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing
FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as
an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced
probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond
the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement
with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration
during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we
initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to
the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both
visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as
a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we
show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant
performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement
through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Benefiting from contrastively trained visual encoders on large-scale natural
scene images, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various visual perception tasks. However, the inherent
limitations of contrastive learning upon summarized descriptions fundamentally
restrict the capabilities of models in meticulous reasoning, particularly in
crucial scenarios of geometric problem-solving. To enhance geometric
understanding, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework
for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using
generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code,
and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from
modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on
caption similarity. We train CLIP using our strong negative learning method,
namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for
geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM,
significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning
benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models
like GPT-4o. We further study the impact of different negative sample
construction methods and the number of negative samples on the geometric
reasoning performance of LMM, yielding fruitful conclusions. The code and

animation. However, critical challenges remain in (i) generating highly dynamic
videos while preserving character consistency, (ii) achieving precise emotion
alignment between characters and audio, and (iii) enabling multi-character
audio-driven animation. To address these challenges, we propose
HunyuanVideo-Avatar, a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT)-based model
capable of simultaneously generating dynamic, emotion-controllable, and
multi-character dialogue videos. Concretely, HunyuanVideo-Avatar introduces
three key innovations: (i) A character image injection module is designed to
replace the conventional addition-based character conditioning scheme,
eliminating the inherent condition mismatch between training and inference.
This ensures the dynamic motion and strong character consistency; (ii) An Audio
Emotion Module (AEM) is introduced to extract and transfer the emotional cues
from an emotion reference image to the target generated video, enabling
fine-grained and accurate emotion style control; (iii) A Face-Aware Audio
Adapter (FAA) is proposed to isolate the audio-driven character with
latent-level face mask, enabling independent audio injection via
cross-attention for multi-character scenarios. These innovations empower
HunyuanVideo-Avatar to surpass state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets
and a newly proposed wild dataset, generating realistic avatars in dynamic,
immersive scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在长时记忆方面表现不佳，主要因注意力层处理长序列时计算成本高。

Method: 采用状态空间模型（SSM）扩展时间记忆，结合块状SSM扫描和局部注意力机制，平衡空间一致性与长时记忆。

Result: 在Memory Maze和Minecraft数据集上，模型在长时记忆任务中表现优于基线，同时保持高效推理速度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了视频扩散模型的长时记忆问题，适用于交互式应用。

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently shown promise for world modeling through
autoregressive frame prediction conditioned on actions. However, they struggle
to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with
processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend
temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous
approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully
exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central
to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades
off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local
attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the
long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and
reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and
Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in
preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds
suitable for interactive applications.

Motivation: 病理学基础模型在癌症诊断和预后中展现出巨大潜力，但其临床转化面临模型泛化性、数据泄漏和缺乏标准化基准等问题。

Method: PathBench通过多中心数据集（15,888张WSIs，8,549名患者）、严格的数据泄漏预防和全面的临床任务评估（64项任务），构建了一个自动化评估平台。

Result: 评估了19个PFM，发现Virchow2和H-Optimus-1表现最佳。

Conclusion: PathBench为PFM的开发和临床转化提供了标准化平台，加速其在实际病理学中的应用。

Abstract: The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational
histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image
analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these
models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics,
their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in
optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and
lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even
the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying
their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by
narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete
task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common
cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical
spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for
continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data,
enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical
complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with
strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have
collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing
over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs
shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This
work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and
offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse
clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these
transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.

Motivation: 评估口头化不确定性在VLMs中的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 对三类VLMs在四个任务领域和三种评估场景中进行全面评估，并引入视觉信心感知提示策略。

Result: 当前VLMs普遍校准不足，但视觉推理模型表现更好；提出的提示策略显著改善了校准。

Conclusion: 模态对齐和模型忠实性对可靠的多模态系统至关重要。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.

<details>

Motivation: 解决长时视频音频推理与细粒度像素理解对模型分辨率与覆盖范围的不同需求之间的冲突。

Method: 采用两系统架构：全局推理系统选择关键帧并重写任务，细节理解系统进行像素级定位。通过强化学习框架Omni-R1训练全局推理系统。

Result: 在RefAVS和REVOS基准测试中超越监督基线及专用模型，提升域外泛化能力并减少多模态幻觉。

Conclusion: 首次成功将强化学习应用于大规模全模态推理，为通用基础模型提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Long-horizon video-audio reasoning and fine-grained pixel understanding
impose conflicting requirements on omnimodal models: dense temporal coverage
demands many low-resolution frames, whereas precise grounding calls for
high-resolution inputs. We tackle this trade-off with a two-system
architecture: a Global Reasoning System selects informative keyframes and
rewrites the task at low spatial cost, while a Detail Understanding System
performs pixel-level grounding on the selected high-resolution snippets.
Because ``optimal'' keyframe selection and reformulation are ambiguous and hard
to supervise, we formulate them as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and
present Omni-R1, an end-to-end RL framework built on Group Relative Policy
Optimization. Omni-R1 trains the Global Reasoning System through hierarchical
rewards obtained via online collaboration with the Detail Understanding System,
requiring only one epoch of RL on small task splits.
  Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, namely Referring Audio-Visual
Segmentation (RefAVS) and Reasoning Video Object Segmentation (REVOS), show
that Omni-R1 not only surpasses strong supervised baselines but also
outperforms specialized state-of-the-art models, while substantially improving
out-of-domain generalization and mitigating multimodal hallucination. Our
results demonstrate the first successful application of RL to large-scale
omnimodal reasoning and highlight a scalable path toward universally foundation
models.

Conclusion: HaloGS通过双表示设计，成功平衡了几何精度与渲染效率，适用于室内外多样化场景。

Abstract: High fidelity 3D reconstruction and rendering hinge on capturing precise
geometry while preserving photo realistic detail. Most existing methods either
fuse these goals into a single cumbersome model or adopt hybrid schemes whose
uniform primitives lead to a trade off between efficiency and fidelity. In this
paper, we introduce HaloGS, a dual representation that loosely couples coarse
triangles for geometry with Gaussian primitives for appearance, motivated by
the lightweight classic geometry representations and their proven efficiency in
real world applications. Our design yields a compact yet expressive model
capable of photo realistic rendering across both indoor and outdoor
environments, seamlessly adapting to varying levels of scene complexity.
Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields
both compact, accurate geometry and high fidelity renderings, especially in
challenging scenarios where robust geometric structure make a clear difference.

Result: 在重建任务中渲染质量与现有方法相当，但在未来帧外推中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模高斯粒子动力学系统，实现了高效的运动外推，无需依赖手动先验。

Abstract: This paper aims to model the dynamics of 3D Gaussians from visual
observations to support temporal extrapolation. Existing dynamic 3D
reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics
or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their
extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on
particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability
to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and
follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the
observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian
particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state
vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space
encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural
ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in
dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to
decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable
rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and
significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/QuanJinSheng/ParticleGS.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保留、文本对齐和图像质量上优于现有方法，无需额外训练或数据收集。

Conclusion: In-Context Brush框架在自定义主题插入任务中表现出色，具有高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual
generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes"
user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However,
existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high
fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In
this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized
subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context
learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the
textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the
masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the
subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a
pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via
dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting"
within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect
the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across
different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential
attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and
image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring
dedicated training or additional data collection.

Conclusion: Ground-R1为现有方法提供了可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive general
capabilities across a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, the reasoning
processes of LVLMs often suffer from unreliable outputs and limited
interpretability. To address this, grounded visual reasoning has emerged as a
promising paradigm that enforces responses anchored on salient visual evidence
regions. However, existing approaches typically rely on costly supervision such
as bounding box annotations, chain-of-thought rationale or external tool calls,
limiting their scalability. In this work, we propose Ground-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables grounded visual reasoning without requiring
explicit evidence or rationale annotations. Ground-R1 consists of a grounding
phase that generates evidence region rollouts based on format constraints, and
an answering phase that produces responses guided by both answer correctness
and format adherence rewards. Extensive experiments across multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks manifest that Ground-R1 achieves superior performance and
exhibits emergent cognitive behaviors such as uncertainty awareness, spatial
perception, and iterative refinement, offering a scalable and interpretable
alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity

ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2

Conclusion: VLM-3R为单目3D空间辅助和具身推理提供了有效解决方案，并通过新基准验证其性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for 2D images and
videos has motivated extending these models to understand 3D scenes, aiming for
human-like visual-spatial intelligence. Nevertheless, achieving deep spatial
understanding comparable to human capabilities poses significant challenges in
model encoding and data acquisition. Existing methods frequently depend on
external depth sensors for geometry capture or utilize off-the-shelf algorithms
for pre-constructing 3D maps, thereby limiting their scalability, especially
with prevalent monocular video inputs and for time-sensitive applications. In
this work, we introduce VLM-3R, a unified framework for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) that incorporates 3D Reconstructive instruction tuning. VLM-3R processes
monocular video frames by employing a geometry encoder to derive implicit 3D
tokens that represent spatial understanding. Leveraging our Spatial-Visual-View
Fusion and over 200K curated 3D reconstructive instruction tuning
question-answer (QA) pairs, VLM-3R effectively aligns real-world spatial
context with language instructions. This enables monocular 3D spatial
assistance and embodied reasoning. To facilitate the evaluation of temporal
reasoning, we introduce the Vision-Spatial-Temporal Intelligence benchmark,
featuring over 138.6K QA pairs across five distinct tasks focused on evolving
spatial relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model,
VLM-3R, not only facilitates robust visual-spatial reasoning but also enables
the understanding of temporal 3D context changes, excelling in both accuracy
and scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需专家知识的情况下，实现了对可变形4D对象的低维表示和可控性。

Abstract: The motion of deformable 4D objects lies in a low-dimensional manifold. To
better capture the low dimensionality and enable better controllability,
traditional methods have devised several heuristic-based methods, i.e.,
rigging, for manipulating dynamic objects in an intuitive fashion. However,
such representations are not scalable due to the need for expert knowledge of
specific categories. Instead, we study the automatic exploration of such
low-dimensional structures in a purely data-driven manner. Specifically, we
design a novel representation that encodes deformable 4D objects into a sparse
set of spatially grounded blobs and an instance-aware feature volume to
disentangle the pose and instance information of the 3D shape. With such a
representation, we can manipulate the pose of 3D objects intuitively by
modifying the parameters of the blobs, while preserving rich instance-specific
information. We evaluate the proposed method on a variety of object categories
and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Project page:

Result: 在WebVid-10M和MC-Bench上的实验验证了MotionPro的有效性。

Conclusion: MotionPro实现了更精细的运动控制，并通过MC-Bench为评估提供了基准。

Abstract: Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for
image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large
Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly
defining movement region, leading to coarse motion control and failing to
disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these, we present MotionPro,
a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and
motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target
motion category (i.e., object or camera moving), respectively. Technically,
MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking
model, and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference
scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels, our
region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly
utilizing trajectories within local regions, thereby effectively characterizing
fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the
predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement
regions. To pursue natural motion control, MotionPro further strengthens video
denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask
through feature modulation. More remarkably, we meticulously construct a
benchmark, i.e., MC-Bench, with 1.1K user-annotated image-trajectory pairs, for
the evaluation of both fine-grained and object-level I2V motion control.
Extensive experiments conducted on WebVid-10M and MC-Bench demonstrate the
effectiveness of MotionPro. Please refer to our project page for more results:

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful generative paradigm for
visual generation. The current de-facto standard of next token prediction
commonly operates over a single-scale sequence of dense image tokens, and is
incapable of utilizing global context especially for early tokens prediction.
In this paper, we introduce a new autoregressive design to model a hierarchy
from a few low-resolution image tokens to the typical dense image tokens, and
delve into a thorough hierarchical dependency across multi-scale image tokens.
Technically, we present a Hierarchical Masked Autoregressive models (Hi-MAR)
that pivot on low-resolution image tokens to trigger hierarchical
autoregressive modeling in a multi-phase manner. Hi-MAR learns to predict a few
image tokens in low resolution, functioning as intermediary pivots to reflect
global structure, in the first phase. Such pivots act as the additional
guidance to strengthen the next autoregressive modeling phase by shaping global
structural awareness of typical dense image tokens. A new Diffusion Transformer
head is further devised to amplify the global context among all tokens for mask
token prediction. Extensive evaluations on both class-conditional and
text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that Hi-MAR outperforms typical AR
baselines, while requiring fewer computational costs. Code is available at

*Zeyi Huang,Yuyang Ji,Anirudh Sundara Rajan,Zefan Cai,Wen Xiao,Junjie Hu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisTA是一个新的强化学习框架，通过动态探索和选择工具库中的工具，提升视觉代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖无训练提示或大规模微调，缺乏主动工具探索且工具多样性有限，微调方法还需大量人工监督。VisTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VisTA利用端到端强化学习（通过GRPO优化策略）迭代优化工具选择策略，以任务结果为反馈信号。

Result: 在ChartQA、Geometry3K和BlindTest基准测试中，VisTA显著优于无训练基线，尤其在分布外样本上表现突出。

Conclusion: VisTA能增强泛化能力，自适应利用多样化工具，为灵活、经验驱动的视觉推理系统铺平道路。

Abstract: We introduce VisTA, a new reinforcement learning framework that empowers
visual agents to dynamically explore, select, and combine tools from a diverse
library based on empirical performance. Existing methods for tool-augmented
reasoning either rely on training-free prompting or large-scale fine-tuning;
both lack active tool exploration and typically assume limited tool diversity,
and fine-tuning methods additionally demand extensive human supervision. In
contrast, VisTA leverages end-to-end reinforcement learning to iteratively
refine sophisticated, query-specific tool selection strategies, using task
outcomes as feedback signals. Through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), our framework enables an agent to autonomously discover effective
tool-selection pathways without requiring explicit reasoning supervision.
Experiments on the ChartQA, Geometry3K, and BlindTest benchmarks demonstrate
that VisTA achieves substantial performance gains over training-free baselines,
especially on out-of-distribution examples. These results highlight VisTA's
ability to enhance generalization, adaptively utilize diverse tools, and pave
the way for flexible, experience-driven visual reasoning systems.

*Di Wu,Yixin Wan,Kai-Wei Chang*

TL;DR: VisRet通过将文本查询投影到图像模态，再在图像模态内检索，显著提升了T2I检索性能，兼容现成检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨模态相似性对齐在多模态嵌入中的局限性，特别是对细微视觉空间特征的识别不足。

Method: VisRet首先通过T2I生成将文本查询投影到图像模态，然后在图像模态内进行检索。

Result: 在三个知识密集型T2I检索基准上，VisRet将NDCG@10提升了24.5%至32.7%，并显著提升了下游视觉问答准确性。

Conclusion: VisRet是一种即插即用的方法，适用于知识密集型多模态系统，兼容现有检索器。

Abstract: We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for Text-to-Image
(T2I) retrieval that mitigates the limitations of cross-modal similarity
alignment of existing multi-modal embeddings. VisRet first projects textual
queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval
within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in
recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Experiments on three
knowledge-intensive T2I retrieval benchmarks, including a newly introduced
multi-entity benchmark, demonstrate that VisRet consistently improves T2I
retrieval by 24.5% to 32.7% NDCG@10 across different embedding models. VisRet
also significantly benefits downstream visual question answering accuracy when
used in retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. The method is plug-and-play
and compatible with off-the-shelf retrievers, making it an effective module for
knowledge-intensive multi-modal systems. Our code and the new benchmark are
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/Visualize-then-Retrieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测基准过于粗粒度，无法准确评估主题一致性和自然性，需建立更精细的评估体系。

Method: 提出OpenS2V-Eval评测基准和OpenS2V-5M数据集，设计自动指标NexusScore、NaturalScore和GmeScore。

Result: 评测了16种S2V模型，揭示了其优缺点；构建了500万高质量主题-文本-视频三元组数据集。

Conclusion: OpenS2V-Nexus为未来S2V研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully
incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production
of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose
OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and
(ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V
benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained
assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to
generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity
fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven
major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data.
Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we
propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to
separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in
generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across
different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V
generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P
subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information
diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing
information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw
frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we
deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动机器人在复杂未知环境中通用主动映射的挑战，现有方法因数据不足和保守策略而受限。

Method: 引入GLEAM-Bench基准测试，提出GLEAM策略，结合语义表示、长期可导航目标和随机策略。

Result: 在128个未见复杂场景中，覆盖率达66.50%（提升9.49%），轨迹高效且映射精度提高。

Conclusion: GLEAM在通用主动映射中表现优异，为复杂环境提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable active mapping in complex unknown environments remains a
critical challenge for mobile robots. Existing methods, constrained by
insufficient training data and conservative exploration strategies, exhibit
limited generalizability across scenes with diverse layouts and complex
connectivity. To enable scalable training and reliable evaluation, we introduce
GLEAM-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark designed for generalizable active
mapping with 1,152 diverse 3D scenes from synthetic and real-scan datasets.
Building upon this foundation, we propose GLEAM, a unified generalizable
exploration policy for active mapping. Its superior generalizability comes
mainly from our semantic representations, long-term navigable goals, and
randomized strategies. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved
mapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes. Project page:

*Qinyu Zhao,Jaskirat Singh,Ming Xu,Akshay Asthana,Stephen Gould,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DiSA的训练无关方法，通过逐步减少扩散步数来提升自回归模型中扩散采样的推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自回归过程中生成的标记增多，后续标记的分布更受约束，更容易采样。这一观察表明可以逐步减少扩散步数以提升效率。

Method: 提出扩散步退火（DiSA），在自回归过程中逐步减少扩散步数（如从50步降至5步），无需额外训练。

Result: DiSA在MAR和Harmon上实现了5-10倍的推理加速，在FlowAR和xAR上实现了1.4-2.5倍加速，且生成质量未受影响。

Conclusion: DiSA是一种简单有效的方法，适用于自回归模型中的扩散采样加速，且与现有扩散加速方法互补。

Abstract: An increasing number of autoregressive models, such as MAR, FlowAR, xAR, and
Harmon adopt diffusion sampling to improve the quality of image generation.
However, this strategy leads to low inference efficiency, because it usually
takes 50 to 100 steps for diffusion to sample a token. This paper explores how
to effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens
are generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more
constrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if
a model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog
and thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at
later generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer
perceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising
paths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step
annealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion
steps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and
gradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from
our finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary
to existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be
implemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,
achieves $5-10\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\times$
for FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality.

<details>

Motivation: EEG-ER领域缺乏统一的评估协议，导致研究结果难以公平比较和追踪进展。

Method: 分析了216篇论文，提出EEGain框架，标准化预处理、数据分割和评估指标，并整合六大常用数据集。

Result: EEGain通过验证六大数据集和四种常用方法，显著提升了研究的可重复性和可比性。

Conclusion: EEGain为EEG-ER领域提供了统一的评估标准，加速了研究进展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography-based Emotion Recognition (EEG-ER) has become a
growing research area in recent years. Analyzing 216 papers published between
2018 and 2023, we uncover that the field lacks a unified evaluation protocol,
which is essential to fairly define the state of the art, compare new
approaches and to track the field's progress. We report the main
inconsistencies between the used evaluation protocols, which are related to
ground truth definition, evaluation metric selection, data splitting types
(e.g., subject-dependent or subject-independent) and the use of different
datasets. Capitalizing on this state-of-the-art research, we propose a unified
evaluation protocol, EEGain (https://github.com/EmotionLab/EEGain), which
enables an easy and efficient evaluation of new methods and datasets. EEGain is
a novel open source software framework, offering the capability to compare -
and thus define - state-of-the-art results. EEGain includes standardized
methods for data pre-processing, data splitting, evaluation metrics, and the
ability to load the six most relevant datasets (i.e., AMIGOS, DEAP, DREAMER,
MAHNOB-HCI, SEED, SEED-IV) in EEG-ER with only a single line of code. In
addition, we have assessed and validated EEGain using these six datasets on the
four most common publicly available methods (EEGNet, DeepConvNet,
ShallowConvNet, TSception). This is a significant step to make research on
EEG-ER more reproducible and comparable, thereby accelerating the overall
progress of the field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球心肺疾病增加，现有检测方法存在局限性，尤其是在资源匮乏地区。

Method: 采用MFCC特征提取和GRU与CNN混合模型处理低成本听诊器音频信号。

Result: 模型能准确诊断六种肺病和五种心血管疾病，并生成数字音频记录。

Conclusion: 低成本听诊器与高效AI模型的结合，为标准化医疗提供了变革性解决方案。

Abstract: The increase in cardiac and pulmonary diseases presents an alarming and
pervasive health challenge on a global scale responsible for unexpected and
premature mortalities. In spite of how serious these conditions are, existing
methods of detection and treatment encounter challenges, particularly in
achieving timely diagnosis for effective medical intervention. Manual screening
processes commonly used for primary detection of cardiac and respiratory
problems face inherent limitations, increased by a scarcity of skilled medical
practitioners in remote or under-resourced areas. To address this, our study
introduces an innovative yet efficient model which integrates AI for diagnosing
lung and heart conditions concurrently using the auscultation sounds. Unlike
the already high-priced digital stethoscope, our proposed model has been
particularly designed to deploy on low-cost embedded devices and thus ensure
applicability in under-developed regions that actually face an issue of
accessing medical care. Our proposed model incorporates MFCC feature extraction
and engineering techniques to ensure that the signal is well analyzed for
accurate diagnostics through the hybrid model combining Gated Recurrent Unit
with CNN in processing audio signals recorded from the low-cost stethoscope.
Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, the model generates digital audio records
that facilitate in classifying six pulmonary and five cardiovascular diseases.
Hence, the integration of a cost effective stethoscope with an efficient AI
empowered model deployed on a web app providing real-time analysis, represents
a transformative step towards standardized healthcare

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多模态感知与语义通信框架（LLM-DiSAC），通过RF与视觉数据融合、语义传输网络和分布式学习策略，提升复杂环境下的感知精度和通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单模态感知系统在复杂动态环境中的局限性，如视角有限和空间覆盖不足。

Method: 1. 开发RF-视觉融合网络（RVFN）实现多模态数据整合；2. 提出基于LLM的语义传输网络（LSTN）优化通信；3. 设计基于Transformer的聚合模型（TRAM）融合分布式特征；4. 采用两阶段分布式学习策略保护数据隐私。

Result: 在合成多视角RF-视觉数据集上验证了LLM-DiSAC的优异性能。

Conclusion: LLM-DiSAC框架有效提升了复杂环境下的感知精度和通信效率，同时兼顾数据隐私。

Abstract: Traditional single-modal sensing systems-based solely on either radio
frequency (RF) or visual data-struggle to cope with the demands of complex and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, single-device systems are constrained by
limited perspectives and insufficient spatial coverage, which impairs their
effectiveness in urban or non-line-of-sight scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven distributed
integrated multimodal sensing and semantic communication (LLM-DiSAC) framework.
Specifically, our system consists of multiple collaborative sensing devices
equipped with RF and camera modules, working together with an aggregation
center to enhance sensing accuracy. First, on sensing devices, LLM-DiSAC
develops an RF-vision fusion network (RVFN), which employs specialized feature
extractors for RF and visual data, followed by a cross-attention module for
effective multimodal integration. Second, a LLM-based semantic transmission
network (LSTN) is proposed to enhance communication efficiency, where the
LLM-based decoder leverages known channel parameters, such as transceiver
distance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to mitigate semantic distortion.
Third, at the aggregation center, a transformer-based aggregation model (TRAM)
with an adaptive aggregation attention mechanism is developed to fuse
distributed features and enhance sensing accuracy. To preserve data privacy, a
two-stage distributed learning strategy is introduced, allowing local model
training at the device level and centralized aggregation model training using
intermediate features. Finally, evaluations on a synthetic multi-view RF-visual
dataset generated by the Genesis simulation engine show that LLM-DiSAC achieves
a good performance.

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is
rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the
bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale
data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity,
and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training,
retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for
LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain
mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on
efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage
hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data
serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing),
LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training
strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA,
LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review
recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning,
integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g.,
configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM
techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中复杂数据库模式常导致模式歧义，影响NL2SQL系统的准确性。

Method: ODIN生成一组可能的SQL查询，动态调整建议数量，并利用用户反馈优化推荐。

Result: ODIN比基线方法生成正确SQL查询的概率提高了1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: ODIN有效解决了模式歧义问题，提升了NL2SQL系统的实用性。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) systems translate natural language into SQL
queries, allowing users with no technical background to interact with databases
and create tools like reports or visualizations. While recent advancements in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved NL2SQL accuracy,
schema ambiguity remains a major challenge in enterprise environments with
complex schemas, where multiple tables and columns with semantically similar
names often co-exist. To address schema ambiguity, we introduce ODIN, a NL2SQL
recommendation engine. Instead of producing a single SQL query given a natural
language question, ODIN generates a set of potential SQL queries by accounting
for different interpretations of ambiguous schema components. ODIN dynamically
adjusts the number of suggestions based on the level of ambiguity, and ODIN
learns from user feedback to personalize future SQL query recommendations. Our
evaluation shows that ODIN improves the likelihood of generating the correct
SQL query by 1.5-2$\times$ compared to baselines.

Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a
myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and
animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled
through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at
hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only
customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss
function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these
generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple
components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of
these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged
geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh
that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between
functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test
on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by
learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better
performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.

Motivation: 扩散视频生成计算成本高，现有加速方法常导致质量下降，需新方法平衡速度与质量。

Method: 大模型处理高噪声步骤（Sketching），小模型优化低噪声步骤（Rendering），协作降低推理成本。

Result: 实验显示SRDiffusion在Wan上实现3倍加速，CogVideoX上2倍加速，且VBench质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: SRDiffusion为视频生成提供了一种正交于现有加速策略的新方向，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora,
CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video,
image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances,
diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially
for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference
by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In
this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages
collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The
large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity
(Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps
(Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss
for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a
new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a
practical solution for scalable video generation.

Conclusion: 新算法在无需标记或参数调整的情况下，显著提升了细胞分割的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from
time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such
as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised
segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy,
they depend on high-quality labelled images, making them unsuitable for
segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel
unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for
noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive
assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding
criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at
different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed
segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and
real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and
accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.

Conclusion: BRITE为标记MRI提供了一种亮度不变的运动跟踪方法，显著提高了准确性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is an imaging technique for noninvasively
tracking tissue motion in vivo by creating a visible pattern of magnetization
saturation (tags) that deforms with the tissue. Due to longitudinal relaxation
and progression to steady-state, the tags and tissue brightnesses change over
time, which makes tracking with optical flow methods error-prone. Although
Fourier methods can alleviate these problems, they are also sensitive to
brightness changes as well as spectral spreading due to motion. To address
these problems, we introduce the brightness-invariant tracking estimation
(BRITE) technique for tagged MRI. BRITE disentangles the anatomy from the tag
pattern in the observed tagged image sequence and simultaneously estimates the
Lagrangian motion. The inherent ill-posedness of this problem is addressed by
leveraging the expressive power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models to
represent the probabilistic distribution of the underlying anatomy and the
flexibility of physics-informed neural networks to estimate
biologically-plausible motion. A set of tagged MR images of a gel phantom was
acquired with various tag periods and imaging flip angles to demonstrate the
impact of brightness variations and to validate our method. The results show
that BRITE achieves more accurate motion and strain estimates as compared to
other state of the art methods, while also being resistant to tag fading.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合预处理管道和大型残差nnU-Net架构的方法，用于仅基于CT扫描预测中风病灶进展，并在ISLES'24挑战中取得最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球三大死因之一，准确识别病灶边界对诊断和治疗至关重要。现有监督深度学习方法需要大量标注数据，而ISLES'24挑战提供了纵向影像数据，要求仅用CT输入预测病灶进展。

Method: 采用深度学习支持的颅骨剥离和自定义强度窗口预处理管道，结合标准大型残差nnU-Net架构进行分割。

Result: 在测试集上平均Dice得分为28.5，标准差为21.27。

Conclusion: 精心设计的预处理管道结合nnU-Net架构能有效提升仅基于CT的中风病灶分割准确性。

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of stroke lesion boundaries is critical for diagnosis and
treatment. Supervised deep learning methods have emerged as the leading
solution for stroke lesion segmentation but require large, diverse, and
annotated datasets. The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing
longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the
hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with
annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the
ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of
lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our
winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline
including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is
beneficial for accurate segmentation. Combined with a standard large residual
nnU-Net architecture for segmentation, this approach achieves a mean test Dice
of 28.5 with a standard deviation of 21.27.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为ReflectGAN的生成对抗网络框架，用于从植被覆盖的卫星图像中重建裸土反射率，从而提高土壤有机碳（SOC）的估算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植被覆盖会干扰卫星图像中土壤反射率的准确测量，从而影响SOC的估算可靠性。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究使用ReflectGAN框架，通过学习植被覆盖与裸土反射率之间的光谱转换关系，重建裸土反射率。实验基于LUCAS 2018数据集和Landsat 8图像，训练了多种学习模型。

Result: ReflectGAN生成的反射率信号显著提升了SOC估算模型的性能（如R²提高35%，RMSE降低43%），优于现有植被校正方法。

Conclusion: ReflectGAN能够有效提高植被覆盖区域SOC估算的准确性，为土壤监测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical indicator of soil health, but its
accurate estimation from satellite imagery is hindered in vegetated regions due
to spectral contamination from plant cover, which obscures soil reflectance and
reduces model reliability. This study proposes the Reflectance Transformation
Generative Adversarial Network (ReflectGAN), a novel paired GAN-based framework
designed to reconstruct accurate bare soil reflectance from vegetated soil
satellite observations. By learning the spectral transformation between
vegetated and bare soil reflectance, ReflectGAN facilitates more precise SOC
estimation under mixed land cover conditions. Using the LUCAS 2018 dataset and
corresponding Landsat 8 imagery, we trained multiple learning-based models on
both original and ReflectGAN-reconstructed reflectance inputs. Models trained
on ReflectGAN outputs consistently outperformed those using existing vegetation
correction methods. For example, the best-performing model (RF) achieved an
$R^2$ of 0.54, RMSE of 3.95, and RPD of 2.07 when applied to the
ReflectGAN-generated signals, representing a 35\% increase in $R^2$, a 43\%
reduction in RMSE, and a 43\% improvement in RPD compared to the best existing
method (PMM-SU). The performance of the models with ReflectGAN is also better
compared to their counterparts when applied to another dataset, i.e.,
Sentinel-2 imagery. These findings demonstrate the potential of ReflectGAN to
improve SOC estimation accuracy in vegetated landscapes, supporting more
reliable soil monitoring.

Motivation: 解决微CT图像中因X射线衰减重叠导致的分割不准确问题，并突破体积深度学习中的内存瓶颈。

Method: 采用3D Octree结构的卷积层和渐进式生成模型，结合低分辨率3D微CT图像与高分辨率2D激光扫描显微镜图像进行训练。

Result: 分辨率从7微米/体素提升至0.44微米/体素，实现了准确的矿物分割，显著改善了孔隙表征和矿物区分。

Conclusion: 该框架为现代地球科学成像中的主要计算限制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a memory-efficient algorithm for significantly enhancing the
quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks
using a generative model. The proposed model achieves a 16x increase in
resolution and corrects inaccuracies in segmentation caused by the overlapping
X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurements across different minerals. The
generative model employed is a 3D Octree-based convolutional Wasserstein
generative adversarial network with gradient penalty. To address the challenge
of high memory consumption inherent in standard 3D convolutional layers, we
implemented an Octree structure within the 3D progressive growing generator
model. This enabled the use of memory-efficient 3D Octree-based convolutional
layers. The approach is pivotal in overcoming the long-standing memory
bottleneck in volumetric deep learning, making it possible to reach 16x
super-resolution in 3D, a scale that is challenging to attain due to cubic
memory scaling. For training, we utilized segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT
images along with unpaired segmented complementary 2D high-resolution laser
scanning microscope images. Post-training, resolution improved from 7 to 0.44
micro-m/voxel with accurate segmentation of constituent minerals. Validated on
Berea sandstone, this framework demonstrates substantial improvements in pore
characterization and mineral differentiation, offering a robust solution to one
of the primary computational limitations in modern geoscientific imaging.

Conclusion: MedITok为医学影像提供统一的标记空间，推动了自回归模型在医疗领域的应用。

Abstract: Advanced autoregressive models have reshaped multimodal AI. However, their
transformative potential in medical imaging remains largely untapped due to the
absence of a unified visual tokenizer -- one capable of capturing fine-grained
visual structures for faithful image reconstruction and realistic image
synthesis, as well as rich semantics for accurate diagnosis and image
interpretation. To this end, we present MedITok, the first unified tokenizer
tailored for medical images, encoding both low-level structural details and
high-level clinical semantics within a unified latent space. To balance these
competing objectives, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework: a
visual representation alignment stage that cold-starts the tokenizer
reconstruction learning with a visual semantic constraint, followed by a
textual semantic representation alignment stage that infuses detailed clinical
semantics into the latent space. Trained on the meticulously collected
large-scale dataset with over 30 million medical images and 2 million
image-caption pairs, MedITok achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than
30 datasets across 9 imaging modalities and 4 different tasks. By providing a
unified token space for autoregressive modeling, MedITok supports a wide range
of tasks in clinical diagnostics and generative healthcare applications. Model

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PerA的自监督学习方法，通过语义完美对齐的样本对生成通用的遥感图像特征，解决了对比学习在遥感图像中的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习方法在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但在遥感图像中因领域差距需要特定适应。PerA旨在通过语义对齐的样本对提升特征质量。

Method: PerA通过空间不重叠的掩码对增强图像进行采样，生成语义对齐但外观不一致的样本对，确保师生模型一致性并预测可学习的掩码标记。

Result: 实验表明，PerA在内存效率更高、支持更大批量训练的同时，在多个下游任务中性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: PerA为遥感图像解释提供了一种高效的自监督学习方法，有望推动实际应用。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models
without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL)
methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise
interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have
achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require
specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a
novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS
features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically,
PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks
to augmented images rather than random cropping. With disjoint masks, we divide
patches from different views into different parts that are semantically aligned
but inconsistent in appearance. Our framework provides high-quality features by
ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask
tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates
higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its
sparse inputs. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which
contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple
downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, which verified the
superiority of our method. We hope this work will contribute to practical
remote sensing interpretation works.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩分解（LRD）虽能减少参数和计算复杂度，但若分解秩不够小，可能无法显著加速训练/推理，而小秩又可能导致精度下降。

Method: 提出秩优化和分解层顺序冻结两种技术，应用于卷积和Transformer模型。

Result: 实验表明，两种技术结合可将训练吞吐量提升60%，推理吞吐量提升37%，同时保持精度接近原始模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效加速低秩分解模型，且无需牺牲精度。

Abstract: Low Rank Decomposition (LRD) is a model compression technique applied to the
weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original
models

Conclusion: 传统多头注意力并非最优选择，GQKVA提供了更轻量、快速的替代方案。

Abstract: Massive transformer-based models face several challenges, including slow and
computationally intensive pre-training and over-parametrization. This paper
addresses these challenges by proposing a versatile method called GQKVA, which
generalizes query, key, and value grouping techniques. GQKVA is designed to
speed up transformer pre-training while reducing the model size. Our
experiments with various GQKVA variants highlight a clear trade-off between
performance and model size, allowing for customized choices based on resource
and time limitations. Our findings also indicate that the conventional
multi-head attention approach is not always the best choice, as there are
lighter and faster alternatives available. We tested our method on ViT, which
achieved an approximate 0.3% increase in accuracy while reducing the model size
by about 4% in the task of image classification. Additionally, our most

Result: 提出的方法在评估集上达到93.05%的检测准确率，优于第二名方法（LLM）2.82%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，小型且任务特定的方法在虚假信息检测任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that
repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such
misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the
claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs
and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in
absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a
graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the
caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived
from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption.
Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations,
our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create
datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model
against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores
$93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the
second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller
and task-specific methods.

Result: ELDeR在性能上优于现有分层剪枝方法，同时显著降低恢复微调的计算成本。

Conclusion: ELDeR是一种高效的LLM剪枝技术，具有明显的端到端加速效果。

Abstract: The deployment of Large language models (LLMs) in many fields is largely
hindered by their high computational and memory costs. Recent studies suggest
that LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning
methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts
still contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating
the remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,
requiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address
this, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.
Based on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through
Data-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each
transformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights
of each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way.
After that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and
input of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be
transferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR
reduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better
preserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show
that ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise
structured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs.
Since ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect
is obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.

Result: 参数减少20-75%，准确率仅下降1-5%，且支持LoRA微调和量化。

Conclusion: LLM-Sieve为生成小型高性能任务特定模型提供了实用机制。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted for narrow
tasks - such as medical question answering or sentiment analysis - and deployed
in resource-constrained settings, a key question arises: how many parameters
does a task actually need? In this work, we present LLM-Sieve, the first
comprehensive framework for task-specific pruning of LLMs that achieves 20-75%
parameter reduction with only 1-5% accuracy degradation across diverse domains.
Unlike prior methods that apply uniform pruning or rely on low-rank
approximations of weight matrices or inputs in isolation, LLM-Sieve (i) learns
task-aware joint projections to better approximate output behavior, and (ii)
employs a Genetic Algorithm to discover differentiated pruning levels for each
matrix. LLM-Sieve is fully compatible with LoRA fine-tuning and quantization,
and uniquely demonstrates strong generalization across datasets within the same
task domain. Together, these results establish a practical and robust mechanism
to generate smaller performant task-specific models.

Result: 在多个基准测试（包括多模态推理任务）中，显著优于现有模型压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效实现计算/内存优化的LLMs/LMMs，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Modern foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and large
multi-modal models (LMMs) require a massive amount of computational and memory
resources. We propose a new framework to convert such LLMs/LMMs into a
reduced-dimension latent structure. Our method extends a local activation-aware
tensor decomposition to a global attention-aware joint tensor de-composition.
Our framework can significantly improve the model accuracy over the existing
model compression methods when reducing the latent dimension to realize
computationally/memory-efficient LLMs/LLMs. We show the benefit on several
benchmark including multi-modal reasoning tasks.

Method: 采用基于微专家混合（μ-MoE）的自适应激活感知剪枝技术，无需重新训练，动态调整稀疏性。

Result: 实验表明，μ-MoE能动态适应任务/提示相关的结构化稀疏性，显著降低推理复杂度。

Conclusion: μ-MoE为大型模型的高效推理提供了一种灵活且计算高效的方法。

Abstract: To tackle the huge computational demand of large foundation models,
activation-aware compression techniques without retraining have been
introduced. However, since these rely on calibration data, domain shift may
arise for unknown downstream tasks. With a computationally efficient
calibration, activation-aware pruning can be executed for every prompt
adaptively, yet achieving reduced complexity at inference. We formulate it as a
mixture of micro-experts, called $\mu$-MoE. Several experiments demonstrate
that $\mu$-MoE can dynamically adapt to task/prompt-dependent structured
sparsity on the fly.

Conclusion: 通过合成数据和重新加权策略，显著提升了LLM在移动应用中的错误校正能力。

Abstract: Error correction is an important capability when applying large language
models (LLMs) to facilitate user typing on mobile devices. In this paper, we
use LLMs to synthesize a high-quality dataset of error correction pairs to
evaluate and improve LLMs for mobile applications. We first prompt LLMs with
error correction domain knowledge to build a scalable and reliable addition to
the existing data synthesis pipeline. We then adapt the synthetic data
distribution to match the mobile application domain by reweighting the samples.
The reweighting model is learnt by predicting (a handful of) live A/B test
metrics when deploying LLMs in production, given the LLM performance on offline
evaluation data and scores from a small privacy-preserving on-device language
model. Finally, we present best practices for mixing our synthetic data with
other data sources to improve model performance on error correction in both
offline evaluation and production live A/B testing.

Motivation: 深度网络在连续任务学习中容易发生灾难性遗忘，现有方法多关注参数保护，但参数保护不切实际且效率低。

Result: LwI能够自适应分配新任务通路，以参数高效的方式解决灾难性遗忘，实验验证其优越性。

Conclusion: LwI通过保护通路而非参数，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Deep networks are prone to catastrophic forgetting during sequential task
learning, i.e., losing the knowledge about old tasks upon learning new tasks.
To this end, continual learning(CL) has emerged, whose existing methods focus
mostly on regulating or protecting the parameters associated with the previous
tasks. However, parameter protection is often impractical, since the size of
parameters for storing the old-task knowledge increases linearly with the
number of tasks, otherwise it is hard to preserve the parameters related to the
old-task knowledge. In this work, we bring a dual opinion from neuroscience and
physics to CL: in the whole networks, the pathways matter more than the
parameters when concerning the knowledge acquired from the old tasks. Following
this opinion, we propose a novel CL framework, learning without isolation(LwI),
where model fusion is formulated as graph matching and the pathways occupied by
the old tasks are protected without being isolated. Thanks to the sparsity of
activation channels in a deep network, LwI can adaptively allocate available
pathways for a new task, realizing pathway protection and addressing
catastrophic forgetting in a parameter-efficient manner. Experiments on popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LwI.

Motivation: LLMs常表现出偏见，研究旨在探索其在多轮对话中自我修正偏见的可能性。

Method: 测试LLMs在9个主题、3类问题（主观、随机、客观）上的表现，并提出B-score作为偏见检测指标。

Result: LLMs在多轮对话中对随机问题能减少偏见；B-score显著提高了对LLM答案的验证准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话和B-score能有效减少LLMs的偏见并提升答案验证效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit strong biases, e.g, against women
or in favor of the number 7. We investigate whether LLMs would be able to
output less biased answers when allowed to observe their prior answers to the
same question in a multi-turn conversation. To understand which types of
questions invite more biased answers, we test LLMs on our proposed set of
questions that span 9 topics and belong to three types: (1) Subjective; (2)
Random; and (3) Objective. Interestingly, LLMs are able to "de-bias" themselves
in a multi-turn conversation in response to questions that seek an Random,
unbiased answer. Furthermore, we propose B-score, a novel metric that is
effective in detecting biases to Subjective, Random, Easy, and Hard questions.
On MMLU, HLE, and CSQA, leveraging B-score substantially improves the
verification accuracy of LLM answers (i.e, accepting LLM correct answers and
rejecting incorrect ones) compared to using verbalized confidence scores or the
frequency of single-turn answers alone. Code and data are available at:

Method: 动态分配rollout预算和自适应温度调整策略。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RL训练中的效率与探索能力问题。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks, which has
drawn significant attention to reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs. However,
existing approaches allocate an equal number of rollouts to all questions
during the RL process, which is inefficient. This inefficiency stems from the
fact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more
rollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.
Furthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's
exploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of
the base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for
dynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems,
enabling more efficient RL training. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive
dynamic temperature adjustment strategy to maintain the entropy at a stable
level, thereby encouraging sufficient exploration. This enables LLMs to improve
response precision while preserving their exploratory ability to uncover
potential correct pathways. The code and data is available on:

Result: 实验表明，高维任务（如图像合成）适合避免时空导数的目标函数，而低维任务则可通过高阶导数捕捉锐利特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为流映射模型提供了一种高效训练方案，适用于不同维度的任务。

Abstract: Building on the framework proposed in Boffi et al. (2024), we present a
systematic approach for learning flow maps associated with flow and diffusion
models. Flow map-based models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass
recent efforts to improve the efficiency of generative models based on
solutions to differential equations. By exploiting a relationship between the
velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of
change of the flow map, we show how to convert existing distillation schemes
into direct training algorithms via self-distillation, eliminating the need for
pre-trained models. We empirically evaluate several instantiations of our
framework, finding that high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis benefit
from objective functions that avoid temporal and spatial derivatives of the
flow map, while lower-dimensional tasks can benefit from objectives
incorporating higher-order derivatives to capture sharp features.

Conclusion: LORE为视觉编码器的对抗微调提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案，同时优化了鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual encoders have become fundamental components in modern computer vision
pipelines. However, ensuring robustness against adversarial perturbations
remains a critical challenge. Recent efforts have explored both supervised and
unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning strategies. We identify two key
limitations in these approaches: (i) they often suffer from instability,
especially during the early stages of fine-tuning, resulting in suboptimal
convergence and degraded performance on clean data, and (ii) they exhibit a
suboptimal trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy, hindering the
simultaneous optimization of both objectives. To overcome these challenges, we
propose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised
adversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization,
which offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as
improving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing
embedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data
performance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that
LORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal
degradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in
out-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image
embeddings.

Conclusion: AmorLIP通过高效计算分摊和优化目标，实现了更高效的CLIP预训练，同时保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong
zero-shot performance across diverse downstream text-image tasks. Existing CLIP
methods typically optimize a contrastive objective using negative samples drawn
from each minibatch. To achieve robust representation learning, these methods
require extremely large batch sizes and escalate computational demands to
hundreds or even thousands of GPUs. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue
often compromise downstream performance, prolong training duration, or face
scalability challenges with very large datasets. To overcome these limitations,
we propose AmorLIP, an efficient CLIP pretraining framework that amortizes
expensive computations involved in contrastive learning through lightweight
neural networks, which substantially improves training efficiency and
performance. Leveraging insights from a spectral factorization of energy-based
models, we introduce novel amortization objectives along with practical
techniques to improve training stability. Extensive experiments across 38
downstream tasks demonstrate the superior zero-shot classification and
retrieval capabilities of AmorLIP, consistently outperforming standard CLIP
baselines with substantial relative improvements of up to 12.24%.

Abstract: While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with
their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to
struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This
shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in
diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range
spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a
benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion
models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark
evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable
text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated
text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source
variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and
instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into
architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal
generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline at

Conclusion: NPS-Pruning方法在模型剪枝、知识迁移和压缩方面具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep
learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned
models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model
with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce
interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve
compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning
strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the
task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the
differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different
task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a
novel method called Neural Parameter Search (NPS-Pruning) for slimming down
fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through
neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has
three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model
interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and
enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original
performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments
across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains. The
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/NPS-Pruning.

Conclusion: NTHR通过针对性调整惩罚机制，解决了GRPO中的LLD问题，为强化学习在LLM中的应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) emerging as a widely used algorithm in recent systems.
Despite GRPO's widespread adoption, we identify a previously unrecognized
phenomenon we term Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), wherein the likelihood
of correct responses marginally increases or even decreases during training.
This behavior mirrors a recently discovered misalignment issue in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), attributed to the influence of negative
gradients. We provide a theoretical analysis of GRPO's learning dynamic,
identifying the source of LLD as the naive penalization of all tokens in
incorrect responses with the same strength. To address this, we develop a
method called NTHR, which downweights penalties on tokens contributing to the
LLD. Unlike prior DPO-based approaches, NTHR takes advantage of GRPO's
group-based structure, using correct responses as anchors to identify
influential tokens. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
NTHR effectively mitigates LLD, yielding consistent performance gains across
models ranging from 0.5B to 3B parameters.

Conclusion: I2MoE提升了任务性能并增强了多模态交互的可解释性。

Abstract: Modality fusion is a cornerstone of multimodal learning, enabling information
integration from diverse data sources. However, vanilla fusion methods are
limited by (1) inability to account for heterogeneous interactions between
modalities and (2) lack of interpretability in uncovering the multimodal
interactions inherent in the data. To this end, we propose I2MoE (Interpretable
Multimodal Interaction-aware Mixture of Experts), an end-to-end MoE framework
designed to enhance modality fusion by explicitly modeling diverse multimodal
interactions, as well as providing interpretation on a local and global level.
First, I2MoE utilizes different interaction experts with weakly supervised
interaction losses to learn multimodal interactions in a data-driven way.
Second, I2MoE deploys a reweighting model that assigns importance scores for
the output of each interaction expert, which offers sample-level and
dataset-level interpretation. Extensive evaluation of medical and general
multimodal datasets shows that I2MoE is flexible enough to be combined with
different fusion techniques, consistently improves task performance, and
provides interpretation across various real-world scenarios. Code is available

Conclusion: 令牌稀疏性和神经元稀疏性之间存在协同效应，CoreMatching框架通过利用这一效应显著提升了VLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel across diverse tasks but suffer from high
inference costs in time and memory. Token sparsity mitigates inefficiencies in
token usage, while neuron sparsity reduces high-dimensional computations, both
offering promising solutions to enhance efficiency. Recently, these two
sparsity paradigms have evolved largely in parallel, fostering the prevailing
assumption that they function independently. However, a fundamental yet
underexplored question remains: Do they truly operate in isolation, or is there
a deeper underlying interplay that has yet to be uncovered? In this paper, we
conduct the first comprehensive investigation into this question. By
introducing and analyzing the matching mechanism between Core Neurons and Core
Tokens, we found that key neurons and tokens for inference mutually influence
and reinforce each other. Building on this insight, we propose CoreMatching, a
co-adaptive sparse inference framework, which leverages the synergy between
token and neuron sparsity to enhance inference efficiency. Through theoretical
analysis and efficiency evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on ten image understanding tasks and three
hardware devices. Notably, on the NVIDIA Titan Xp, it achieved 5x FLOPs
reduction and a 10x overall speedup. Code is released at

Result: TypiClust 在低预算 FAL 中表现优异，对分布偏移不敏感，且对特征提取方法的选择有一定适应性。

Conclusion: TypiClust 是低预算 FAL 的有效策略，为有限数据场景下的 FAL 提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Federated Active Learning (FAL) seeks to reduce the burden of annotation
under the realistic constraints of federated learning by leveraging Active
Learning (AL). As FAL settings make it more expensive to obtain ground truth
labels, FAL strategies that work well in low-budget regimes, where the amount
of annotation is very limited, are needed. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of TypiClust, a successful low-budget AL strategy, in low-budget
FAL settings. Our empirical results show that TypiClust works well even in
low-budget FAL settings contrasted with relatively low performances of other
methods, although these settings present additional challenges, such as data
heterogeneity, compared to AL. In addition, we show that FAL settings cause
distribution shifts in terms of typicality, but TypiClust is not very
vulnerable to the shifts. We also analyze the sensitivity of TypiClust to
feature extraction methods, and it suggests a way to perform FAL even in
limited data situations.

Abstract: Dataset distillation enables the training of deep neural networks with
comparable performance in significantly reduced time by compressing large
datasets into small and representative ones. Although the introduction of
generative models has made great achievements in this field, the distributions
of their distilled datasets are not diverse enough to represent the original
ones, leading to a decrease in downstream validation accuracy. In this paper,
we present a diversity-driven generative dataset distillation method based on a
diffusion model to solve this problem. We introduce self-adaptive memory to
align the distribution between distilled and real datasets, assessing the
representativeness. The degree of alignment leads the diffusion model to
generate more diverse datasets during the distillation process. Extensive
experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in most situations, proving its ability to tackle dataset distillation tasks.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a framework for constructing prediction

scenarios often involve distribution shifts that violate exchangeability,
leading to unreliable coverage and inflated prediction sets. To address this
challenge, we first introduce Reconstruction Loss-Scaled Conformal Prediction
(RLSCP), which utilizes reconstruction losses derived from a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) as an uncertainty metric to scale score functions. While
RLSCP demonstrates performance improvements, mainly resulting in better
coverage, it quantifies quantiles based on a fixed calibration dataset without
considering the discrepancies between test and train datasets in an
unexchangeable setting. In the next step, we propose Weighted Quantile
Loss-scaled Conformal Prediction (WQLCP), which refines RLSCP by incorporating
a weighted notion of exchangeability, adjusting the calibration quantile
threshold based on weights with respect to the ratio of calibration and test
loss values. This approach improves the CP-generated prediction set outputs in
the presence of distribution shifts. Experiments on large-scale datasets,
including ImageNet variants, demonstrate that WQLCP outperforms existing
baselines by consistently maintaining coverage while reducing prediction set
sizes, providing a robust solution for CP under distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 多模态学习中的确定性一对一对齐假设过于简化现实中的多对多关系（多重性），本文探讨其成因与影响，并呼吁研究新的多重性感知学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设模态间为一对一确定性对齐，而现实中多模态关系是多对多的（多重性），这导致训练不确定性、评估不可靠等问题。

Method: 通过分析多重性的成因（语义抽象、表示不对称、任务依赖性模糊）及其在多模态学习各阶段的影响，提出研究新方向。

Result: 多重性是贯穿数据构建、训练和评估的根本瓶颈，需开发新的学习框架和数据集构建协议。

Conclusion: 呼吁关注多重性，开发多重性感知的多模态学习方法和数据集构建方法。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the
emergence of large-scale pre-training across various modalities. However, most
current approaches are built on the assumption of a deterministic, one-to-one
alignment between modalities. This oversimplifies real-world multimodal
relationships, where their nature is inherently many-to-many. This phenomenon,
named multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an
inevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and
task-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that
multiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of
the multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and
evaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity,
and highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable
evaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research
directions on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks
and dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity.

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型上实验，显示方法显著提升了鲁棒性和跨模态能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了MLLMs的单模态推理能力和多模态任务表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing
task-relevant from irrelevant signals, particularly in tasks like Visual
Question Answering (VQA), which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or
spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality
Competency Problem: the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities.
This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks such as
image classification or pure text question answering, where models are expected
to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from
irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We
refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and
measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem. We further design
a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this
problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to
fine-tune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both
heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations via Projected Gradient
Descent (PGD), and a consistency regularization strategy applied to model
outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy, and VQA tasks) and multiple model families
with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and
cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting
unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Understanding pain-related facial behaviors is essential for digital
healthcare in terms of effective monitoring, assisted diagnostics, and
treatment planning, particularly for patients unable to communicate verbally.
Existing data-driven methods of detecting pain from facial expressions are
limited due to interpretability and severity quantification. To this end, we
propose GraphAU-Pain, leveraging a graph-based framework to model facial Action

represented as graph nodes, with co-occurrence relationships as edges, enabling
a more expressive depiction of pain-related facial behaviors. By utilizing a
relational graph neural network, our framework offers improved interpretability
and significant performance gains. Experiments conducted on the publicly
available UNBC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the GraphAU-Pain,
achieving an F1-score of 66.21% and accuracy of 87.61% in pain intensity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保护方法（如水印）无法有效防止仅通过观察公开输出进行的模型模仿，需要在API访问的现实约束下主动保护LLM。

Method: 通过微调LLM的最后一层线性层，引入对抗性损失，使输出对模仿者具有误导性。

Result: 实验表明，防御性生成的输出显著降低了模仿模型的性能，同时保持或提升了原始模型的性能。

Conclusion: DOGe是一种高效且实用的防御策略，可有效防止基于知识蒸馏的模型模仿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic
investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model
imitation via knowledge distillation (KD).In practical scenarios, competitors
can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly
accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by
observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify
imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the
teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation
purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of
actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access.
We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe)
strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs remain
accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for
distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by
fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial
loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation
attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving or
even improving the original performance of the teacher model, student models
distilled from the defensively generated teacher outputs demonstrate
catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating our method's effectiveness
as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法依赖预定义模式或不准确估计，未能完全捕捉注意力动态，导致效率与准确性不足。

Result: 在保持最佳准确性的同时，实现了优于或可比现有方法的速度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享精确注意力模式，高效且准确地捕捉了注意力动态。

Abstract: Sparse attention methods exploit the inherent sparsity in attention to speed
up the prefilling phase of long-context inference, mitigating the quadratic
complexity of full attention computation. While existing sparse attention
methods rely on predefined patterns or inaccurate estimations to approximate
attention behavior, they often fail to fully capture the true dynamics of
attention, resulting in reduced efficiency and compromised accuracy. Instead,
we propose a highly accurate sparse attention mechanism that shares similar yet
precise attention patterns across heads, enabling a more realistic capture of
the dynamic behavior of attention. Our approach is grounded in two key
observations: (1) attention patterns demonstrate strong inter-head similarity,
and (2) this similarity remains remarkably consistent across diverse inputs. By
strategically sharing computed accurate patterns across attention heads, our
method effectively captures actual patterns while requiring full attention
computation for only a small subset of heads. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior or comparable speedup relative
to state-of-the-art methods while delivering the best overall accuracy.

Result: MVC-ZigAL框架显著提升了少步T2MV扩散模型的保真度和一致性，同时保持了其高效性。

Conclusion: MVC-ZigAL通过强化学习和约束优化，有效解决了少步T2MV生成中的保真度和一致性问题。

Abstract: Text-to-multiview (T2MV) generation, which produces coherent multiview images
from a single text prompt, remains computationally intensive, while accelerated
T2MV methods using few-step diffusion models often sacrifice image fidelity and
view consistency. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning framework tailored for few-step T2MV diffusion models to
jointly optimize per-view fidelity and cross-view consistency. Specifically, we
first reformulate T2MV denoising across all views as a single unified Markov
decision process, enabling multiview-aware policy optimization driven by a
joint-view reward objective. Next, we introduce ZMV-Sampling, a test-time T2MV
sampling technique that adds an inversion-denoising pass to reinforce both
viewpoint and text conditioning, resulting in improved T2MV generation at the
cost of inference time. To internalize its performance gains into the base
sampling policy, we develop MV-ZigAL, a novel policy optimization strategy that
uses reward advantages of ZMV-Sampling over standard sampling as learning
signals for policy updates. Finally, noting that the joint-view reward
objective under-optimizes per-view fidelity but naively optimizing single-view
metrics neglects cross-view alignment, we reframe RL finetuning for T2MV
diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes per-view
fidelity subject to an explicit joint-view constraint, thereby enabling more
efficient and balanced policy updates. By integrating this constrained
optimization paradigm with MV-ZigAL, we establish our complete RL finetuning
framework, referred to as MVC-ZigAL, which effectively refines the few-step
T2MV diffusion baseline in both fidelity and consistency while preserving its
few-step efficiency.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for complex reasoning via Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is effective but limited by reliance on
costly, domain-specific supervision. We explore Reinforcement Learning from
Internal Feedback (RLIF), a framework that enables LLMs to learn from intrinsic
signals without external rewards or labeled data. We propose Intuitor, an RLIF
method that uses a model's own confidence, termed self-certainty, as its sole
reward signal. Intuitor replaces external rewards in Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with self-certainty scores, enabling fully unsupervised
learning. Experiments demonstrate that Intuitor matches GRPO's performance on
mathematical benchmarks while achieving superior generalization to
out-of-domain tasks like code generation, without requiring gold solutions or
test cases. Our findings show that intrinsic model signals can drive effective
learning across domains, offering a scalable alternative to RLVR for autonomous
AI systems where verifiable rewards are unavailable. Code is available at

Conclusion: PFD为未来扩散模型泛化的实证和理论研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
capable of producing high-quality samples that generalize beyond the training
data. However, evaluating this generalization remains challenging: theoretical
metrics are often impractical for high-dimensional data, while no practical
metrics rigorously measure generalization. In this work, we bridge this gap by
introducing probability flow distance ($\texttt{PFD}$), a theoretically
grounded and computationally efficient metric to measure distributional
generalization. Specifically, $\texttt{PFD}$ quantifies the distance between
distributions by comparing their noise-to-data mappings induced by the
probability flow ODE. Moreover, by using $\texttt{PFD}$ under a teacher-student
evaluation protocol, we empirically uncover several key generalization
behaviors in diffusion models, including: (1) scaling behavior from
memorization to generalization, (2) early learning and double descent training
dynamics, and (3) bias-variance decomposition. Beyond these insights, our work
lays a foundation for future empirical and theoretical studies on
generalization in diffusion models.

Conclusion: BPO是一种高效且通用的框架，适用于多种目标策略优化任务，为DPO提供了理论支持和实践改进。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) is widely used as a simple and stable
method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. This
paper investigates a generalized DPO loss that enables a policy model to match
the target policy from a likelihood ratio estimation perspective. The ratio of
the target policy provides a unique identification of the policy distribution
without relying on reward models or partition functions. This allows the
generalized loss to retain both simplicity and theoretical guarantees, which
prior work such as $f$-PO fails to achieve simultaneously. We propose Bregman
preference optimization (BPO), a generalized framework for ratio matching that
provides a family of objective functions achieving target policy optimality.
BPO subsumes DPO as a special case and offers tractable forms for all
instances, allowing implementation with a few lines of code. We further develop
scaled Basu's power divergence (SBA), a gradient scaling method that can be
used for BPO instances. The BPO framework complements other DPO variants and is
applicable to target policies defined by these variants. In experiments, unlike
other probabilistic loss extensions such as $f$-DPO or $f$-PO, which exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and diversity, instances of BPO improve
both win rate and entropy compared with DPO. When applied to
Llama-3-Instruct-8B, BPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among Llama-3-8B
backbones, with a 55.9\% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively
training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both
data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major
challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence
of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical
practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection,
privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods
typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to
compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every
disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing
modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high
dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight,
low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the
missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH
Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings
consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. The code and

Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel
functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle
thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors
drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and
employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our
kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of
projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and
experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel
functions. We further apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest
Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X
higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the state-of-the-art
graph-based search algorithm HNSW.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in discrete
data modeling. However, existing methods typically rely on a fixed rate
transition matrix during training, which not only limits the expressiveness of
latent representations, a fundamental strength of variational methods, but also
constrains the overall design space. To address these limitations, we propose
Discrete Markov Bridge, a novel framework specifically designed for discrete
representation learning. Our approach is built upon two key components: Matrix
Learning and Score Learning. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis,
establishing formal performance guarantees for Matrix Learning and proving the
convergence of the overall framework. Furthermore, we analyze the space
complexity of our method, addressing practical constraints identified in prior
studies. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed Discrete Markov Bridge, which achieves an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
of 1.38 on the Text8 dataset, outperforming established baselines. Moreover,
the proposed model demonstrates competitive performance on the CIFAR-10
dataset, achieving results comparable to those obtained by image-specific

Result: 在线DPO在模型误设且同构时表现最佳；RLHF在稀疏奖励下样本效率更高。

Conclusion: RLHF和DPO各有优势，选择取决于模型误设类型和样本效率需求。

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap
into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and
an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization
setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy
model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or
online DPO can outperform one another depending on the type of model
mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard
DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both
mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete
construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that
RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective
reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning.
Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the
performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer
practical insights into when each method is preferred.

Conclusion: ESLM可扩展至不同模型规模和预训练语料库，并自然与知识蒸馏结合。

Abstract: Large language model pretraining is compute-intensive, yet many tokens
contribute marginally to learning, resulting in inefficiency. We introduce
Efficient Selective Language Modeling (ESLM), a risk-aware algorithm that
improves training efficiency and distributional robustness by performing online
token-level batch selection. ESLM leverages per-token statistics (e.g., entropy
or loss) and applies value-at-risk thresholding to retain only the most
informative tokens per batch. This data-centric mechanism reshapes the training
loss, prioritizing high-risk tokens and eliminating redundant gradient
computation. We frame ESLM as a bilevel game: the model competes with a masking
adversary that selects worst-case token subsets under a constrained
thresholding rule. In the loss-based setting, ESLM recovers conditional
value-at-risk loss minimization, providing a principled connection to
distributionally robust optimization. We extend our approach to Ada-ESLM, which
adaptively tunes the selection confidence during training. Experiments on GPT-2
pretraining show that ESLM significantly reduces training FLOPs while
maintaining or improving both perplexity and downstream performance compared to
baselines. Our approach also scales across model sizes, pretraining corpora,
and integrates naturally with knowledge distillation.

the automatic classification of brain MRIs. However, despite their strong
predictive performance, these models find limited clinical utility due to their
opaque decision making. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates
two core components to enhance diagnostic transparency. First, we introduce a
modular pipeline for converting 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs into textual
radiology reports. Second, we explore the potential of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in the differential diagnosis between
Frontotemporal dementia subtypes, Alzheimer's disease, and normal aging based
on the generated reports. To bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and
explainability, we employ reinforcement learning to incentivize diagnostic
reasoning in LLMs. Without requiring supervised reasoning traces or
distillation from larger models, our approach enables the emergence of
structured diagnostic rationales grounded in neuroimaging findings. Unlike
post-hoc explainability methods that retrospectively justify model decisions,
our framework generates diagnostic rationales as part of the inference
process-producing causally grounded explanations that inform and guide the
model's decision-making process. In doing so, our framework matches the
diagnostic performance of existing deep learning methods while offering
rationales that support its diagnostic conclusions.

Motivation: 推动AI代理在科学发现中的应用，并评估其在开放式机器学习研究中的能力。

Method: MLR-Bench包括201个研究任务、MLR-Judge评估框架和MLR-Agent模块化代理框架，支持分阶段和端到端评估。

Result: LLMs在生成想法和论文结构上表现良好，但编码代理的实验结果常不可靠（80%情况下）。MLR-Judge与人类评估高度一致。

Conclusion: MLR-Bench为社区提供了一个可扩展的研究评估工具，有助于提升AI研究代理的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to
drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning
research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks
sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2)
MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with
carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3)
MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks
through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation,
and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these
distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research
paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced
coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent
ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in
80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental
results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate
MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert
reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation.
We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve
AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在需要人类反馈的任务中，使用偏好数据（如排序）进行强化学习的局限性，指出即使理想化的偏好数据也无法保证近似最优解，并提出需要结合人类评分和算法创新。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是探索强化学习在需要人类定性反馈的任务（如深度研究和旅行规划）中的应用，尤其是偏好数据的有效性及其局限性。

Method: 通过投票理论形式化偏好数据的局限性，类比模型选择答案与选民选择候选人的过程，分析其对强化学习优化的影响。

Result: 研究发现，偏好数据在优化结果上存在根本性限制，无法保证近似最优解，尤其是在需要推理行为的任务中。

Conclusion: 结论指出，需结合人类评分和算法创新以扩展强化学习在需要人类反馈的任务中的应用，尤其是针对推理行为的优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in strengthening the capabilities of large language models
has stemmed from applying reinforcement learning to domains with automatically
verifiable outcomes. A key question is whether we can similarly use RL to
optimize for outcomes in domains where evaluating outcomes inherently requires
human feedback; for example, in tasks like deep research and trip planning,
outcome evaluation is qualitative and there are many possible degrees of
success. One attractive and scalable modality for collecting human feedback is
preference data: ordinal rankings (pairwise or $k$-wise) that indicate, for $k$
given outcomes, which one is preferred. In this work, we study a critical
roadblock: preference data fundamentally and significantly limits outcome-based
optimization. Even with idealized preference data (infinite, noiseless, and
online), the use of ordinal feedback can prevent obtaining even approximately
optimal solutions. We formalize this impossibility using voting theory, drawing
an analogy between how a model chooses to answer a query with how voters choose
a candidate to elect. This indicates that grounded human scoring and
algorithmic innovations are necessary for extending the success of RL
post-training to domains demanding human feedback. We also explore why these
limitations have disproportionately impacted RLHF when it comes to eliciting
reasoning behaviors (e.g., backtracking) versus situations where RLHF has been
historically successful (e.g., instruction-tuning and safety training), finding
that the limitations of preference data primarily suppress RLHF's ability to
elicit robust strategies -- a class that encompasses most reasoning behaviors.

Result: 在Student_100数据集上，模拟准确性提升100%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LLM模拟学生行为时的局限性，提升了模拟的真实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing education, with LLM-based
agents playing a key role in simulating student behavior. A major challenge in
student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at
various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as ``helpful
assistants'', target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they
struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often
produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that
characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To
address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student
simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student
using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from
past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict
student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these
predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better
replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the
\texttt{Student\_100} dataset, consisting of $100$ students working on Python
programming and $5,000$ learning records. Experimental results show that our
method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving $100\%$ improvement
in simulation accuracy.

### [572] [SAEs Are Good for Steering -- If You Select the Right Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20063)
*Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出区分输入特征和输出特征的方法，通过输入和输出评分筛选特征，显著提升了稀疏自编码器（SAE）的导向性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过激活分析特征，未能全面描述特征对模型输出的影响，需更有效区分输入和输出特征。

Method: 提出输入和输出评分方法，用于区分输入特征（捕捉输入模式）和输出特征（影响模型输出）。

Result: 高输入和输出评分很少同时出现在同一特征中；筛选低输出评分特征后，SAE导向性能提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: 输入和输出特征的区分及评分方法显著提升了SAE的实用性，使其在无监督学习中更具竞争力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been proposed as an unsupervised approach to
learn a decomposition of a model's latent space. This enables useful
applications such as steering - influencing the output of a model towards a
desired concept - without requiring labeled data. Current methods identify SAE
features to steer by analyzing the input tokens that activate them. However,
recent work has highlighted that activations alone do not fully describe the
effect of a feature on the model's output. In this work, we draw a distinction
between two types of features: input features, which mainly capture patterns in
the model's input, and output features, which have a human-understandable
effect on the model's output. We propose input and output scores to
characterize and locate these types of features, and show that high values for
both scores rarely co-occur in the same features. These findings have practical
implications: after filtering out features with low output scores, we obtain
2-3x improvements when steering with SAEs, making them competitive with
supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据多样性指标依赖表面启发式方法，与模型行为脱节，因此研究真正驱动语言模型泛化的数据多样性及其度量方法。

Method: 通过大规模实验分析，引入G-Vendi指标（基于梯度熵）和Prismatic Synthesis框架（生成梯度空间低覆盖区域的合成数据）。

Result: G-Vendi与OOD性能强相关（Spearman's ρ≈0.9），Prismatic Synthesis在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 数据多样性对语言模型泛化至关重要，G-Vendi和Prismatic Synthesis为数据多样性的度量和增强提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Effective generalization in language models depends critically on the
diversity of their training data. Yet existing diversity metrics often fall
short of this goal, relying on surface-level heuristics that are decoupled from
model behavior. This motivates us to ask: What kind of diversity in training
data actually drives generalization in language models -- and how can we
measure and amplify it? Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over
300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show
that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM
reasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen
out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies
diversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients. Despite using a small
off-the-shelf proxy model for gradients, G-Vendi consistently outperforms
alternative measures, achieving strong correlation (Spearman's $\rho \approx
0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on both natural language
inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present
Prismatic Synthesis, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by
targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show
that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale
synthetic data -- not just on in-distribution test but across unseen,
out-of-distribution benchmarks -- significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
models that rely on 20 times larger data generator than ours. For example,
PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM, outperforms
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B -- the same base model trained on proprietary data generated
by 671B R1 -- on 6 out of 7 challenging benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过学习MCMC搜索生成的马尔可夫链状态来训练自回归模型的方法，以高效生成具有所需属性的新序列，优于传统随机搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物序列设计等任务中，传统随机搜索方法（如MCMC）在大规模结构化状态空间中效率低下，需要一种能够贪婪优化目标属性的模型以实现高效外推。

Method: 利用MCMC生成的马尔可夫链状态作为训练数据，训练自回归模型，以生成具有目标属性的新序列。

Result: 在蛋白质序列设计、文本情感控制和文本匿名化三个任务中验证，自回归模型的外推能力与MCMC相当或更好，且具有更高的可扩展性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过学习MCMC搜索数据训练的自回归模型能够高效外推，优于传统随机搜索方法，适用于需要优化序列属性的任务。

Abstract: Most successful applications of deep learning involve similar training and
test conditions. However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve
searching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously
known values, which requires novel hypotheses that \emph{extrapolate} beyond
training data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random
search methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial
state, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that
rewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed
proposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces
efficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to
have a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully
extrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model
from the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search. Specifically, our approach
uses selected states from Markov chains as a source of training data for an
autoregressive model, which is then able to efficiently generate novel
sequences that extrapolate along the sequence-level properties of interest. The
proposed approach is validated on three problems: protein sequence design, text
sentiment control, and text anonymization. We find that the autoregressive
model can extrapolate as well or better than MCMC, but with the additional
benefits of scalability and significantly higher sample efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器在机制可解释性（MI）中用于分解神经网络激活，但不同训练运行中学习到的特征不一致，影响MI研究的可靠性。

Method: 提出使用Pairwise Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient（PW-MCC）作为特征一致性的度量指标，并通过理论验证和实验（合成数据与真实LLM数据）支持其有效性。

Result: 实验显示，TopK SAEs在LLM激活上可实现0.80的PW-MCC值，高特征一致性与学习到的特征解释的语义相似性强相关。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区系统性地测量特征一致性，以推动MI领域的稳健累积进展。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are a prominent tool in mechanistic
interpretability (MI) for decomposing neural network activations into
interpretable features. However, the aspiration to identify a canonical set of
features is challenged by the observed inconsistency of learned SAE features
across different training runs, undermining the reliability and efficiency of
MI research. This position paper argues that mechanistic interpretability
should prioritize feature consistency in SAEs -- the reliable convergence to
equivalent feature sets across independent runs. We propose using the Pairwise
Dictionary Mean Correlation Coefficient (PW-MCC) as a practical metric to
operationalize consistency and demonstrate that high levels are achievable
(0.80 for TopK SAEs on LLM activations) with appropriate architectural choices.
Our contributions include detailing the benefits of prioritizing consistency;
providing theoretical grounding and synthetic validation using a model
organism, which verifies PW-MCC as a reliable proxy for ground-truth recovery;
and extending these findings to real-world LLM data, where high feature
consistency strongly correlates with the semantic similarity of learned feature
explanations. We call for a community-wide shift towards systematically
measuring feature consistency to foster robust cumulative progress in MI.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在系统性组合泛化中的不足，提出数据驱动的框架以理解其局限性。

Method: 提出覆盖原则框架，通过实验验证训练数据需求与模型参数规模的关系，分析路径模糊性对性能的影响，并探讨Chain-of-Thought监督的效果。

Result: 训练数据需求随标记集大小呈二次增长，参数规模扩展对效率无显著提升；路径模糊性导致性能下降；Chain-of-Thought监督对多跳任务效率有改善但仍不足。

Conclusion: 覆盖原则为理解组合推理提供了统一视角，指出需架构或训练创新以实现系统性组合性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at pattern matching, yet often fall short in
systematic compositional generalization. We propose the coverage principle: a
data-centric framework showing that models relying primarily on pattern
matching for compositional tasks cannot reliably generalize beyond substituting
fragments that yield identical results when used in the same contexts. We
demonstrate that this framework has a strong predictive power for the
generalization capabilities of Transformers. First, we derive and empirically
confirm that the training data required for two-hop generalization grows at
least quadratically with the token set size, and the training data efficiency
does not improve with 20x parameter scaling. Second, for compositional tasks
with path ambiguity where one variable affects the output through multiple
computational paths, we show that Transformers learn context-dependent state
representations that undermine both performance and interoperability. Third,
Chain-of-Thought supervision improves training data efficiency for multi-hop
tasks but still struggles with path ambiguity. Finally, we outline a
\emph{mechanism-based} taxonomy that distinguishes three ways neural networks
can generalize: structure-based (bounded by coverage), property-based
(leveraging algebraic invariances), and shared-operator (through function
reuse). This conceptual lens contextualizes our results and highlights where
new architectural ideas are needed to achieve systematic compositionally.
Overall, the coverage principle provides a unified lens for understanding
compositional reasoning, and underscores the need for fundamental architectural
or training innovations to achieve truly systematic compositionality.

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning dataset tailored for the classification
of bent radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in astronomical observations. Bent
radio AGN, distinguished by their curved jet structures, provide critical
insights into galaxy cluster dynamics, interactions within the intracluster
medium, and the broader physics of AGN. Despite their astrophysical
significance, the classification of bent radio AGN remains a challenge due to
the scarcity of specialized datasets and benchmarks. To address this, we
present a dataset, derived from a well-recognized radio astronomy survey, that
is designed to support the classification of NAT (Narrow-Angle Tail) and WAT
(Wide-Angle Tail) categories, along with detailed data processing steps. We
further evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models on
the dataset, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and
transformer-based architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
advanced machine learning models in classifying bent radio AGN, with ConvNeXT
achieving the highest F1-scores for both NAT and WAT sources. By sharing this
dataset and benchmarks, we aim to facilitate the advancement of research in AGN
classification, galaxy cluster environments and galaxy evolution.

Motivation: 边缘设备上的AI模型需要高精度和低延迟，传统方法（如剪枝、量化）可能不够高效，因此探索硬件感知NAS以直接优化架构。

Method: 通过将比利时边缘设备与德国高性能计算系统结合，实时测量延迟并快速训练架构候选，验证了该方法在增材制造领域的应用。

Result: 相比人工设计的基线模型，推理速度提升约8.8倍，模型质量提高约1.35倍。

Conclusion: 硬件感知NAS是一种高效的方法，可直接优化边缘设备上的AI模型性能。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning models deployed on edge devices,
e.g., for quality control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), are frequently small
in size. Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a
short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out
with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint
by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however,
also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an
approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find
optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is
introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful
High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture
candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements
on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM
domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster
inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of
~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.

Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型（SLLM）依赖监督微调，但标注数据不足导致泛化能力差，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出MTBI方法，通过语音-文本交错和多任务行为模仿，仅需配对的语音和文本数据，使LLM解码器生成等效响应。

Result: 实验表明，MTBI在提示和任务泛化上优于现有SLLM，且所需监督数据更少。

Conclusion: MTBI方法显著提升了SLLM的泛化能力，为语音与LLM的高效整合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization across
tasks, leading to increased interest in integrating speech with LLMs. These
speech LLMs (SLLMs) typically use supervised fine-tuning to align speech with
text-based LLMs. However, the lack of annotated speech data across a wide range
of tasks hinders alignment efficiency, resulting in poor generalization. To
address these issues, we propose a novel multi-task 'behavior imitation' method
with speech-text interleaving, called MTBI, which relies solely on paired
speech and transcripts. By ensuring the LLM decoder generates equivalent
responses to paired speech and text, we achieve a more generalized SLLM.
Interleaving is used to further enhance alignment efficiency. We introduce a
simple benchmark to evaluate prompt and task generalization across different
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our MTBI outperforms SOTA SLLMs
on both prompt and task generalization, while requiring less supervised speech
data.

Result: Turn-Taking数据集效果与PC-GITA相当；音频拼接和平衡分布可提升性能；PC-GITA模型泛化能力较差，而Turn-Taking模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 非诊断性语音数据可用于PD检测，但需注意个体表现差异和数据集特征优化。

Abstract: Speech-based Parkinson's disease (PD) detection has gained attention for its
automated, cost-effective, and non-intrusive nature. As research studies
usually rely on data from diagnostic-oriented speech tasks, this work explores
the feasibility of diagnosing PD on the basis of speech data not originally
intended for diagnostic purposes, using the Turn-Taking (TT) dataset. Our
findings indicate that TT can be as useful as diagnostic-oriented PD datasets
like PC-GITA. We also investigate which specific dataset characteristics impact
PD classification performance. The results show that concatenating audio
recordings and balancing participants' gender and status distributions can be
beneficial. Cross-dataset evaluation reveals that models trained on PC-GITA
generalize poorly to TT, whereas models trained on TT perform better on
PC-GITA. Furthermore, we provide insights into the high variability across
folds, which is mainly due to large differences in individual speaker
performance.

best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出BALSa方法，通过合成数据生成解决音频-语言对齐问题，并引入LISTEN训练方法以减少音频幻觉，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）在适应音频任务时存在灾难性遗忘和音频幻觉问题，且跨模态对齐依赖大量资源密集型数据。

Method: 利用骨干LLMs合成通用对齐数据（BALSa），并引入LISTEN对比训练方法，扩展至多音频场景。

Result: 实验表明，BALSa有效减少音频幻觉，保持音频理解和指令跟随能力，多音频训练进一步提升模型性能。

Conclusion: BALSa为ALLMs开发提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in
understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted
from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on
audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major
limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after
training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that
are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.
Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically
relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for
instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these
issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose
caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping
audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs
(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed
to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We
further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains
the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that
describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental
results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations
while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,
reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating
multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to the
development of ALLMs.

Motivation: 解决研究者手动引文耗时问题，提升引文推荐和句子生成的准确性与质量。

Method: 结合引文网络和情感意图优化推荐模块；利用原文摘要、上下文、引文意图和推荐文章生成引文句子。

Result: SciRGC在引文推荐和句子生成上优于基线模型，确保上下文相关性。

Conclusion: SciRGC为学术引文生成提供高效解决方案，支持跨学科研究。

Abstract: Citations are crucial in scientific research articles as they highlight the
connection between the current study and prior work. However, this process is
often time-consuming for researchers. In this study, we propose the SciRGC
framework, which aims to automatically recommend citation articles and generate
citation sentences for citation locations within articles. The framework
addresses two key challenges in academic citation generation: 1) how to
accurately identify the author's citation intent and find relevant citation
papers, and 2) how to generate high-quality citation sentences that align with
human preferences. We enhance citation recommendation accuracy in the citation
article recommendation module by incorporating citation networks and sentiment
intent, and generate reasoning-based citation sentences in the citation
sentence generation module by using the original article abstract, local
context, citation intent, and recommended articles as inputs. Additionally, we
propose a new evaluation metric to fairly assess the quality of generated
citation sentences. Through comparisons with baseline models and ablation
experiments, the SciRGC framework not only improves the accuracy and relevance
of citation recommendations but also ensures the appropriateness of the
generated citation sentences in context, providing a valuable tool for
interdisciplinary researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统边缘检测方法在低对比度和纹理区域表现不佳，热带代数提供了一种新的数学工具来增强边界检测。

Method: 提出三种变体：自适应阈值法、多核最小加法和最大加法，结合多尺度处理、Hessian滤波和小波收缩。

Result: 实验表明，热带代数与传统算子结合能改善低对比度和纹理区域的边界检测，定量评估显示边缘清晰度和结构连贯性较好。

Conclusion: 热带代数是一种可扩展且对噪声敏感的边缘检测方法，适用于实际图像分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a tropical geometry-based edge detection framework that
reformulates convolution and gradient computations using min-plus and max-plus
algebra. The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations,
contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three
variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel
min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The
framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet
shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest
that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny
and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions.
Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge
clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of
tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection
in practical image analysis tasks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的干扰消除方法（ICDM），通过分解联合后验概率并分别学习信号和干扰的梯度，显著提升了无线语义通信系统中的干扰消除效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线信号的广播特性使其易受高斯噪声和未知干扰的影响，扩散模型因其去噪能力在无线通信系统中表现优异，但能否有效消除干扰尚待验证。

Method: 将干扰消除问题建模为信号和干扰联合后验概率的最大后验估计问题，提出ICDM模型，分解联合后验为独立先验概率和信道转移概率，并通过扩散模型学习梯度。

Result: 实验表明，ICDM在瑞利衰落信道下显著降低了均方误差（MSE）并提升了感知质量（LPIPS），例如在SNR为20 dB、SINR为0 dB时，MSE降低4.54 dB，LPIPS提升2.47 dB。

Conclusion: ICDM通过分解和学习独立梯度，结合数值迭代方法，实现了高效且准确的干扰消除，为无线语义通信系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved significant success in wireless
communications systems due to their denoising capabilities. The broadcast
nature of wireless signals makes them susceptible not only to Gaussian noise,
but also to unaware interference. This raises the question of whether DMs can
effectively mitigate interference in wireless semantic communication systems.
In this paper, we model the interference cancellation problem as a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) problem over the joint posterior probability of the signal and
interference, and theoretically prove that the solution provides excellent
estimates for the signal and interference. To solve this problem, we develop an
interference cancellation diffusion model (ICDM), which decomposes the joint
posterior into independent prior probabilities of the signal and interference,
along with the channel transition probablity. The log-gradients of these
distributions at each time step are learned separately by DMs and accurately
estimated through deriving. ICDM further integrates these gradients with
advanced numerical iteration method, achieving accurate and rapid interference
cancellation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICDM significantly reduces
the mean square error (MSE) and enhances perceptual quality compared to schemes
without ICDM. For example, on the CelebA dataset under the Rayleigh fading
channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $20$ dB and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of 0 dB, ICDM reduces the MSE by 4.54 dB
and improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) by 2.47 dB.

Method: 通过构造角色扮演提示词，测试LLMs生成错误临床建议的能力。

Result: 即使缺乏技术知识，恶意用户也能通过角色扮演诱导LLMs生成有害内容。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs的特定漏洞，为未来防护措施提供参考。

Abstract: Despite their staggering capabilities as assistant tools, often exceeding
human performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) are still prone to jailbreak
attempts from malevolent users. Although red teaming practices have already
identified and helped to address several such jailbreak techniques, one
particular sturdy approach involving role-playing (which we named `Goofy Game')
seems effective against most of the current LLMs safeguards. This can result in
the provision of unsafe content, which, although not harmful per se, might lead
to dangerous consequences if delivered in a setting such as the medical domain.
In this preliminary and exploratory study, we provide an initial analysis of
how, even without technical knowledge of the internal architecture and
parameters of generative AI models, a malicious user could construct a
role-playing prompt capable of coercing an LLM into producing incorrect (and
potentially harmful) clinical suggestions. We aim to illustrate a specific
vulnerability scenario, providing insights that can support future advancements
in the field.

Conclusion: 该框架可作为诊断工具，利用LLM揭示社会中的隐性规则，为负责任AI提供更精准的目标。

Abstract: This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human
biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how
these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such
as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique.
We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering
hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely
state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the
framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating
self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer
scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences,
while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where
existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors
about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their
self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward
posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how
the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift
reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving
scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling
that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend
to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors
(correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling
posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving
implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad
applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface
the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted
responsible AI.

Method: 研究了多模态思维链（MCoT）等训练无关方法及监督微调（SFT）等训练相关方法，并提出了RGI评估指标。

Result: 两种方法均能不同程度提升LALMs的可靠性，且可靠性意识可跨音频模态迁移。

Conclusion: 可靠性是LALMs的“元能力”，可跨模态迁移，但不同音频模态间仍存在显著差异。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio language models (LALMs) have demonstrated
impressive results and promising prospects in universal understanding and
reasoning across speech, music, and general sound. However, these models still
lack the ability to recognize their knowledge boundaries and refuse to answer
questions they don't know proactively. While there have been successful
attempts to enhance the reliability of LLMs, reliable LALMs remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches
towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal
chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation
metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess
the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both
training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to
different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a "meta
ability", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although
significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and
speech.

Abstract: Generating high-quality piano audio from video requires precise
synchronization between visual cues and musical output, ensuring accurate
semantic and temporal alignment.However, existing evaluation datasets do not
fully capture the intricate synchronization required for piano music
generation. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for two primary reasons: (1)
existing metrics fail to reflect the complexity of video-to-piano music
interactions, and (2) a dedicated benchmark dataset can provide valuable
insights to accelerate progress in high-quality piano music generation. To
address these challenges, we introduce the CoP Benchmark Dataset-a fully
open-sourced, multimodal benchmark designed specifically for video-guided piano
music generation. The proposed Chain-of-Perform (CoP) benchmark offers several
compelling features: (1) detailed multimodal annotations, enabling precise
semantic and temporal alignment between video content and piano audio via
step-by-step Chain-of-Perform guidance; (2) a versatile evaluation framework
for rigorous assessment of both general-purpose and specialized video-to-piano
generation tasks; and (3) full open-sourcing of the dataset, annotations, and
evaluation protocols. The dataset is publicly available at

Result: 实验显示，框架在7个基准上提升4个MLLM性能18.1%，基线RLHF仅5.3%。

Conclusion: Generative RLHF-V显著提升模型对齐效果，且性能随候选响应数量增加呈近线性提升。

Abstract: Training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that align with human
intentions is a long-term challenge. Traditional score-only reward models for
alignment suffer from low accuracy, weak generalization, and poor
interpretability, blocking the progress of alignment methods, e.g.,
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Generative reward models
(GRMs) leverage MLLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities to discriminate
pair-wise responses, but their pair-wise paradigm makes it hard to generalize
to learnable rewards. We introduce Generative RLHF-V, a novel alignment
framework that integrates GRMs with multi-modal RLHF. We propose a two-stage
pipeline: $\textbf{multi-modal generative reward modeling from RL}$, where RL
guides GRMs to actively capture human intention, then predict the correct
pair-wise scores; and $\textbf{RL optimization from grouped comparison}$, which
enhances multi-modal RL scoring precision by grouped responses comparison.
Experimental results demonstrate that, besides out-of-distribution
generalization of RM discrimination, our framework improves 4 MLLMs'
performance across 7 benchmarks by $18.1\%$, while the baseline RLHF is only
$5.3\%$. We further validate that Generative RLHF-V achieves a near-linear
improvement with an increasing number of candidate responses. Our code and
models can be found at https://generative-rlhf-v.github.io.

pedagogical knowledge, tracing, essay scoring, and teacher decision-making, and
(3) a Chain-of-Pedagogy (CoP) prompting strategy for generating and eliciting

Result: 实验表明Diffusion Blend优于基线，接近或超过单独微调模型性能。

Conclusion: Diffusion Blend实现了高效、用户驱动的推理时对齐，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been used recently to align
diffusion models with downstream objectives such as aesthetic quality and
text-image consistency by fine-tuning them to maximize a single reward function
under a fixed KL regularization. However, this approach is inherently
restrictive in practice, where alignment must balance multiple, often
conflicting objectives. Moreover, user preferences vary across prompts,
individuals, and deployment contexts, with varying tolerances for deviation
from a pre-trained base model. We address the problem of inference-time
multi-preference alignment: given a set of basis reward functions and a
reference KL regularization strength, can we design a fine-tuning procedure so
that, at inference time, it can generate images aligned with any user-specified
linear combination of rewards and regularization, without requiring additional
fine-tuning? We propose Diffusion Blend, a novel approach to solve
inference-time multi-preference alignment by blending backward diffusion
processes associated with fine-tuned models, and we instantiate this approach
with two algorithms: DB-MPA for multi-reward alignment and DB-KLA for KL
regularization control. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion Blend
algorithms consistently outperform relevant baselines and closely match or
exceed the performance of individually fine-tuned models, enabling efficient,
user-driven alignment at inference-time. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，GraftLLM在知识转移、知识融合和无遗忘学习方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GraftLLM为跨能力转移提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于异构模型融合和持续学习。

Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM)
research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and
continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated
the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight
models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our
investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting
their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation
with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic
capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to
effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we
introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a
target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general
capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual
learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression
strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while
maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a
compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model
fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate
that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge
fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution
for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at:

Result: 在七个基准测试中，Doc-CoB显著提升了四种流行模型的性能。

Conclusion: Doc-CoB是一种简单有效的机制，无需修改模型架构即可提升文档理解能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
document understanding. However, the information-dense nature of document
images still poses challenges, as most queries depend on only a few relevant
regions, with the rest being redundant. Existing one-pass MLLMs process entire
document images without considering query relevance, often failing to focus on
critical regions and producing unfaithful responses. Inspired by the human
coarse-to-fine reading pattern, we introduce Doc-CoB (Chain-of-Box), a
simple-yet-effective mechanism that integrates human-style visual reasoning
into MLLM without modifying its architecture. Our method allows the model to
autonomously select the set of regions (boxes) most relevant to the query, and
then focus attention on them for further understanding. We first design a fully
automatic pipeline, integrating a commercial MLLM with a layout analyzer, to
generate 249k training samples with intermediate visual reasoning supervision.
Then we incorporate two enabling tasks that improve box identification and
box-query reasoning, which together enhance document understanding. Extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks with four popular models show that Doc-CoB
significantly improves performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and wide
applicability. All code, data, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to
their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However,
their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their
reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and
trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and
mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking
the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we
advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea
is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to
customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner,
supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we
design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime
verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific
constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks:
violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical
comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM
effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and
flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities,
LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a
lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a
potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to
rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.

TL;DR: AdaCtrl是一个动态调整推理长度的框架，通过自适应预算分配和用户控制，提升效率与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理问题时往往效率与效果不平衡，AdaCtrl旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动微调阶段和难度感知强化学习阶段，支持用户手动控制推理深度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，AdaCtrl显著减少响应长度并提升性能，同时支持用户精确控制。

Conclusion: AdaCtrl通过自适应和用户控制，有效平衡了推理效率与效果。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models demonstrate impressive problem-solving
capabilities by employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. However, they
often struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we
propose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive
reasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth.
AdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem
difficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to
prioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a
two-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill
the ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a
difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's
adaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based
on its evolving capabilities during online training. To enable intuitive user
interaction, we design explicit length-triggered tags that function as a
natural interface for budget control. Empirical results show that AdaCtrl
adapts reasoning length based on estimated difficulty, compared to the standard
training baseline that also incorporates fine-tuning and RL, it yields
performance improvements and simultaneously reduces response length by 10.06%
and 12.14% on the more challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, which
require elaborate reasoning, and by 62.05% and 91.04% on the MATH500 and GSM8K
datasets, where more concise responses are sufficient. Furthermore, AdaCtrl
enables precise user control over the reasoning budget, allowing for tailored
responses to meet specific needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的心电图分类系统无法模拟专家诊断的复杂性，ELMs通过生成自由文本响应更接近专家行为，但需探索最有效的心电图输入表示。

Method: 在6个公共数据集和5个评估指标上，对三种心电图输入表示（信号、图像、符号）进行了全面比较。

Result: 符号表示在统计显著性上优于信号和图像输入，并通过消融实验验证了其稳健性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为下一代ELMs的输入表示选择提供了明确指导，符号表示是最优选择。

Abstract: Recent advances have increasingly applied large language models (LLMs) to
electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, giving rise to
Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs). Conditioned on an ECG and a textual
query, an ELM autoregressively generates a free-form textual response. Unlike
traditional classification-based systems, ELMs emulate expert cardiac
electrophysiologists by issuing diagnoses, analyzing waveform morphology,
identifying contributing factors, and proposing patient-specific action plans.
To realize this potential, researchers are curating instruction-tuning datasets
that pair ECGs with textual dialogues and are training ELMs on these resources.
Yet before scaling ELMs further, there is a fundamental question yet to be
explored: What is the most effective ECG input representation? In recent works,
three candidate representations have emerged-raw time-series signals, rendered
images, and discretized symbolic sequences. We present the first comprehensive
benchmark of these modalities across 6 public datasets and 5 evaluation
metrics. We find symbolic representations achieve the greatest number of
statistically significant wins over both signal and image inputs. We further
ablate the LLM backbone, ECG duration, and token budget, and we evaluate
robustness to signal perturbations. We hope that our findings offer clear
guidance for selecting input representations when developing the next
generation of ELMs.

Abstract: The advancements of Large language models (LLMs) have provided great
opportunities to text-to-SQL tasks to overcome the main challenges to
understand complex domain information and complex database structures in
business applications. In this paper, we propose a meta-aware learning
framework to integrate domain knowledge, database schema, chain-of-thought

quality. The proposed framework includes four learning strategies: schema-based
learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning, knowledge-enhanced learning, and key
information tokenization. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding
of database structure and metadata information towards LLM through fine-tuning
to improve its performance on SQL generation within business domains. Through
two experimental studies, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed
methods in execution accuracy, multi-task SQL generation capability, and
reduction of catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in
acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and
associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized
intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification
capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and
model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk
prediction using LLM/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations
and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel
two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed
to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first
stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide
LLM/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on
associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the
reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and
prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk
prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable
insights for clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: 论文提出的基准数据集为未来研究提供了针对性见解，有助于推动LLM因果推理能力的进步。

Abstract: Understanding and inferring causal relationships from texts is a core aspect
of human cognition and is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs)
towards artificial general intelligence. Existing work primarily focuses on
synthetically generated texts which involve simple causal relationships
explicitly mentioned in the text. This fails to reflect the complexities of
real-world tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs are capable of
inferring causal relationships from real-world texts. We develop a benchmark
drawn from real-world academic literature which includes diverse texts with
respect to length, complexity of relationships (different levels of
explicitness, number of events, and causal relationships), and domains and
sub-domains. To the best of our knowledge, our benchmark is the first-ever
real-world dataset for this task. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
evaluated on our proposed benchmark demonstrate significant challenges, with
the best-performing model achieving an average F1 score of only 0.477. Analysis
reveals common pitfalls: difficulty with implicitly stated information, in
distinguishing relevant causal factors from surrounding contextual details, and
with connecting causally relevant information spread across lengthy textual
passages. By systematically characterizing these deficiencies, our benchmark
offers targeted insights for further research into advancing LLM causal
reasoning.

TL;DR: REACT框架通过两阶段方法解决大语言模型编辑中的过拟合问题，实现精确可控的知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型编辑方法容易过拟合，导致编辑内容超出预期范围，需改进。

Method: REACT分为两阶段：1) 提取潜在事实表示并计算方向性“信念偏移”向量；2) 通过可控扰动和预训练分类器实现编辑。

Result: 实验表明REACT显著减少过拟合，并在多种编辑场景下保持可靠性和通用性。

Conclusion: REACT是一种高效且可控的知识编辑框架，适用于大语言模型。

Abstract: Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting,
wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope,
overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To
address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And
Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and
controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored
stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component
Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional
"belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply
controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a
magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only
when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks
demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all
evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our
method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and
generality) under diverse editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在新环境中的性能下降问题，以及现有方法在提高精度时牺牲召回率的局限性。

Method: 将多模型预测和错误检测规则编码为逻辑程序，通过整数规划和启发式搜索寻找最优预测子集。

Result: 在模拟航空影像数据集上，F1分数和准确率分别平均提升13.6%和16.6%。

Conclusion: 一致性溯因是整合多模型知识的有效机制，适用于复杂分布偏移场景。

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often
leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent
artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to
characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the
cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging
multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate
the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various
models as a consistency-based abduction problem. The input predictions and the
learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic
program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model
predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of
logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a
specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge
representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an
efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated
aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we
demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models
and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative
improvements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15
diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results
validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to
robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect reasoners in challenging,
novel scenarios.

Abstract: Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its
fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception,

goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods
suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view)
computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world

diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA.
We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal
driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving
decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep
interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows
superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains
challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0

Motivation: 解决LLMs推理能力提升时的高计算成本和泛化能力下降问题，以及PEFT方法需针对不同LLM重新训练的局限性。

Method: UniR将奖励分解为独立训练的推理模块，通过预定义奖励将轨迹级信号转化为词级指导，训练后可简单叠加到任何LLM的输出上。

Conclusion: UniR是一种高效、灵活且稳健的解决方案，可在不损害LLM核心能力的情况下增强其推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general
capabilities, but enhancing skills such as reasoning often demands substantial
computational resources and may compromise their generalization. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious
alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to
architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose
Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and
plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it
with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the
reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using
predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into
token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at
inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.
This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR
modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their
logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR
significantly outperforms \add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the
Llama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong
generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide
much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust
solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core
capabilities. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/hangeol/UniR

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) enables the development of
intelligent agents capable of engaging in complex and multi-turn dialogues.
However, multi-agent collaboration face critical safety challenges, such as
hallucination amplification and error injection and propagation. This paper
presents GUARDIAN, a unified method for detecting and mitigating multiple
safety concerns in GUARDing Intelligent Agent collaboratioNs. By modeling the
multi-agent collaboration process as a discrete-time temporal attributed graph,
GUARDIAN explicitly captures the propagation dynamics of hallucinations and
errors. The unsupervised encoder-decoder architecture incorporating an
incremental training paradigm, learns to reconstruct node attributes and graph
structures from latent embeddings, enabling the identification of anomalous
nodes and edges with unparalleled precision. Moreover, we introduce a graph
abstraction mechanism based on the Information Bottleneck Theory, which
compresses temporal interaction graphs while preserving essential patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate GUARDIAN's effectiveness in safeguarding LLM
multi-agent collaborations against diverse safety vulnerabilities, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy with efficient resource utilization.

Conclusion: 该研究为哲学家和软件工程师提供了理解GenAI协作中错误和挑战的理论基础，促进更批判性的合作。

Abstract: With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are
increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside
human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper
articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic
distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their
shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different
causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this
framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon
Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I
argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical
philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness,
epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software
development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide
a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve
with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a
structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological
challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing
software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.

Abstract: This paper proposes FieldWorkArena, a benchmark for agentic AI targeting
real-world field work. With the recent increase in demand for agentic AI, they
are required to monitor and report safety and health incidents, as well as
manufacturing-related incidents, that may occur in real-world work

define a new action space that agentic AI should possess for real world work

methods to assess the performance of agentic AI in diverse real-world tasks.
The dataset consists of videos captured on-site and documents actually used in

evaluation considering the characteristics of Multimodal LLM (MLLM) such as

TL;DR: 论文提出Task Memory Engine (TME)，一种模块化内存控制器，通过图结构改进LLMs的多步交互能力，减少幻觉和误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在多步交互中表现不佳，缺乏持久记忆导致目标跟踪和任务依赖管理困难，影响自主代理的可靠性。

Method: TME采用空间记忆框架，用图结构（树或DAG）替代线性上下文，结合TRIM组件建模任务语义和用户意图。

Result: 在四个多步任务中，TME完全消除三个任务的幻觉和误解，总体减少幻觉66.7%、误解83.3%，优于ReAct。

Conclusion: TME的模块化设计支持即插即用和领域定制，为复杂交互场景提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) falter in multi-step interactions -- often
hallucinating, repeating actions, or misinterpreting user corrections -- due to
reliance on linear, unstructured context. This fragility stems from the lack of
persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining
trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a
modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust,
revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory
framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support
consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and
ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or
directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with
prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation
and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to
ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning,
cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100%
of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces
hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns,
outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and
domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and
enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as
open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents.
TME's scalable architecture addresses a critical gap in agent performance

### [612] [BizFinBench: A Business-Driven Real-World Financial Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19457)
*Guilong Lu,Xuntao Guo,Rongjunchen Zhang,Wenqiao Zhu,Ji Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BizFinBench是首个针对金融领域的大语言模型（LLM）评估基准，包含6,781个中文查询，涵盖五个维度。实验显示，不同模型在不同任务中表现各异，但均难以应对复杂跨概念推理场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在金融等逻辑密集、精度关键领域的可靠性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出BizFinBench基准和IteraJudge评估方法，涵盖五个维度的6,781个中文查询，并对25个模型进行测试。

Result: 实验显示，不同模型在不同任务中表现差异显著，如Claude-3.5-Sonnet在数值计算中领先，而开源模型在推理任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能处理常规金融查询，但在复杂跨概念推理任务中表现不足，BizFinBench为未来研究提供了严谨的基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel in general tasks, yet assessing their reliability
in logic-heavy, precision-critical domains like finance, law, and healthcare
remains challenging. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial
applications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,
spanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information
extraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,
grouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both
objective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM
evaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective
metrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source
systems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.
Our evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical
Calculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while
smaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,
proprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with
open-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information
Extraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring
71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,
performance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and
50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries
competently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept
reasoning. BizFinBench offers a rigorous, business-aligned benchmark for future
research. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: ScienceBoard是一个多领域环境与基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在科学工作流中的表现，结果显示当前代理的成功率较低（15%），但为未来改进提供了方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在科学发现中的潜力巨大，但目前缺乏可靠的多领域环境和基准测试来评估其能力。

Method: ScienceBoard包括一个多领域环境和169个真实任务基准，用于测试代理在复杂科学工作流中的表现。

Result: 当前代理（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7）在复杂任务中的成功率仅为15%，表明其局限性。

Conclusion: ScienceBoard为改进LLM代理提供了宝贵见解，未来需进一步优化设计以提升科学发现能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their impact beyond Natural
Language Processing, substantially fostering the development of
interdisciplinary research. Recently, various LLM-based agents have been
developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and
domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with
operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific
problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing
the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which
encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain
environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with
integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via
different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and
(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated
real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in
domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive
evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude
3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short
of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15%
overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for
addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles,
paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code,
environment, and benchmark are at

TL;DR: 论文提出自动化生成工具AutoT2T，将数学应用题转化为表格推理任务，构建新基准TabularGSM，揭示LLMs在复杂表格QA任务中失败的关键原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格QA评估方法依赖昂贵人工标注数据且难以覆盖复杂推理场景，表格结构异质性阻碍系统分析LLMs表现不佳的内在机制。

Method: 提出AutoT2T自动化生成管道，将数学应用题转化为表格推理任务，支持生成含噪声的变体，构建TabularGSM基准。

Result: 实验表明，推理与检索或识别过程的紧密耦合是LLMs在复杂表格QA任务中失败的关键因素。

Conclusion: 模型需发展协同推理能力以有效应对复杂表格QA任务。

Abstract: Reasoning with tabular data holds increasing importance in modern
applications, yet comprehensive evaluation methodologies for
reasoning-intensive Table Question Answering (QA) tasks remain nascent.
Existing research is constrained by two primary bottlenecks: 1) Reliance on
costly manually annotated real-world data, which is difficult to cover complex
reasoning scenarios; 2) The heterogeneity of table structures hinders
systematic analysis of the intrinsic mechanisms behind the underperformance of
LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. To address these issues, we
propose an automated generation pipeline AutoT2T that transforms mathematical
word problems into table-based reasoning tasks, eliminating the need for manual
annotation. The pipeline can generate multiple variants of a table for the same
reasoning problem, including noisy versions to support robustness evaluation.
Based on this, we construct a new benchmark TabularGSM, which systematically
spans a range of table complexities and trap problems. Experimental analyses
through AutoT2T and TabularGSM reveal that the tight coupling between reasoning
and retrieval or identification processes is a key factor underlying the
failure of LLMs in complex Table QA tasks. This highlights the necessity for
models to develop synergistic reasoning capabilities in order to perform
effectively in complex Table QA tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了POBs基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的主观倾向，发现新版本模型一致性下降且偏见增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否及如何表现出主观偏好、观点和信仰，以揭示其潜在偏见对决策的影响。

Method: 开发POBs基准，测试开源和闭源LLMs的可靠性、中立性和一致性，并研究推理和自省机制对结果的影响。

Result: 新版本LLMs一致性降低且偏见增加，推理和自省机制效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs的主观倾向问题需进一步关注，POBs为评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and
increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to
what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These
tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their
behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and
potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference,
Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs'
subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal
domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source
LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and
consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the
test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those
metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms
offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model
versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific
viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend. POBS:

TL;DR: SynLogic是一个数据合成框架和数据集，用于生成多样化的逻辑推理数据，支持RL训练，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源复制主要集中在数学和编码领域，通用推理能力的方法和资源不足，逻辑推理是通用推理的基础。

Method: 提出SynLogic框架，生成可验证的逻辑推理数据，涵盖35种任务，支持调整难度和数量。

Result: 在7B和32B模型上验证，SynLogic在逻辑推理任务上表现优异，超越现有开源数据集，混合训练还能提升数学和编码任务的效率。

Conclusion: SynLogic是提升LLM通用推理能力的宝贵资源，已开源数据和合成工具。

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the
potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in
Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have
primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for
developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is
partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data
suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for
developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental
building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data
synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data
at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic
approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and
quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making
them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B
and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning
performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and
coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and
significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training
model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These
findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline
and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Abstract: Planning represents a fundamental capability of intelligent agents, requiring
comprehensive environmental understanding, rigorous logical reasoning, and
effective sequential decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable performance on certain planning tasks, their broader
application in this domain warrants systematic investigation. This paper
presents a comprehensive review of LLM-based planning. Specifically, this
survey is structured as follows: First, we establish the theoretical
foundations by introducing essential definitions and categories about automated
planning. Next, we provide a detailed taxonomy and analysis of contemporary
LLM-based planning methodologies, categorizing them into three principal
approaches: 1) External Module Augmented Methods that combine LLMs with
additional components for planning, 2) Finetuning-based Methods that involve
using trajectory data and feedback signals to adjust LLMs in order to improve
their planning abilities, and 3) Searching-based Methods that break down
complex tasks into simpler components, navigate the planning space, or enhance
decoding strategies to find the best solutions. Subsequently, we systematically
summarize existing evaluation frameworks, including benchmark datasets,
evaluation metrics and performance comparisons between representative planning
methods. Finally, we discuss the underlying mechanisms enabling LLM-based
planning and outline promising research directions for this rapidly evolving
field. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire
innovation and drive progress in this field.

TL;DR: HS-STaR框架通过分层采样策略，动态分配采样预算，专注于边界难度问题，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有问题均匀分配采样预算，忽略了不同难度问题的学习效用差异，尤其是边界难度问题的更高价值。

Method: 提出HS-STaR框架，先通过轻量级预采样估计问题难度，再动态调整预算集中于边界难度问题。

Result: 在多个推理基准和LLM上，HS-STaR显著优于基线方法，无需额外预算。

Conclusion: HS-STaR通过优化采样策略，高效生成高质量训练数据，提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of
large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for
self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response
selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they
typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking
the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work,
we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the
LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than
both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we
propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners.
Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling
with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify
boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining
budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase,
maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments
across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR
significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling
budget.

Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text

enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for
autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have
developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential
Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where
participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in
non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach
leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to
create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the
best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into
space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate
replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，方法在超大规模和小型LLMs上均表现出性能提升和效率改进。

Conclusion: 提出的图结构方法有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，适用于不同规模的LLMs。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which translates a natural language question into an SQL query,
has advanced with in-context learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing methods show little improvement in performance compared to randomly
chosen demonstrations, and significant performance drops when smaller LLMs
(e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) are used. This indicates that these methods heavily rely
on the intrinsic capabilities of hyper-scaled LLMs, rather than effectively
retrieving useful demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
for effectively retrieving demonstrations and generating SQL queries. We
construct a Deep Contextual Schema Link Graph, which contains key information
and semantic relationship between a question and its database schema items.
This graph-based structure enables effective representation of Text-to-SQL
samples and retrieval of useful demonstrations for in-context learning.
Experimental results on the Spider benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showing consistent improvements in SQL generation performance and
efficiency across both hyper-scaled LLMs and small LLMs. Our code will be
released.

Abstract: Reasoning-based language models have demonstrated strong performance across
various domains, with the most notable gains seen in mathematical and coding
tasks. Recent research has shown that reasoning also offers significant
benefits for LLM safety and guardrail applications. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of training reasoning-based guardrail models for content
moderation, with an emphasis on generalization to custom safety policies at
inference time. Our study focuses on two key dimensions: data efficiency and
inference efficiency. On the data front, we find that reasoning-based models
exhibit strong sample efficiency, achieving competitive performance with
significantly fewer training examples than their non-reasoning counterparts.
This unlocks the potential to repurpose the remaining data for mining
high-value, difficult samples that further enhance model performance. On the
inference side, we evaluate practical trade-offs by introducing reasoning
budgets, examining the impact of reasoning length on latency and accuracy, and
exploring dual-mode training to allow runtime control over reasoning behavior.
Our findings will provide practical insights for researchers and developers to
effectively and efficiently train and deploy reasoning-based guardrails models
in real-world systems.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在历史领域的能力不足，提出专门的历史推理任务以填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了HistBench基准，包含414个高质量历史问题，并设计了HistAgent，配备OCR、翻译、档案搜索和图像理解等工具。

Result: HistAgent在HistBench上的表现显著优于通用模型，如GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 现有通用模型在历史推理任务上表现有限，而专门设计的HistAgent显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly
history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for
AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and
cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many
existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage
with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce
HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate
AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert
contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual
retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and
images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or
cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and
modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world
regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we
further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully
designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding
in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of
27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online
search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%)
and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These
results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and
demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

*Yuanhe Zhang,Xinyue Wang,Haoran Gao,Zhenhong Zhou,Fanyu Meng,Yuyao Zhang,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$PD^3F$的可插拔动态防御框架，用于抵御针对大语言模型（LLMs）的资源消耗攻击，通过输入和输出两阶段的策略显著提升模型在对抗性负载下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）的高计算需求，容易受到资源消耗攻击，导致服务器性能下降甚至崩溃，而现有研究缺乏有效的防御策略。

Method: $PD^3F$采用两阶段防御：输入侧通过资源索引指导动态请求轮询调度，减少恶意攻击下的资源占用；输出侧引入自适应终止机制，提前终止恶意生成。

Result: 在六种模型上的实验表明，$PD^3F$显著缓解了资源消耗攻击，在对抗性负载下用户访问能力提升高达500%。

Conclusion: $PD^3F$为LLMs的弹性和资源感知部署提供了有效防御手段。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), due to substantial computational requirements,
are vulnerable to resource consumption attacks, which can severely degrade
server performance or even cause crashes, as demonstrated by denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks designed for LLMs. However, existing works lack mitigation
strategies against such threats, resulting in unresolved security risks for
real-world LLM deployments. To this end, we propose the Pluggable and Dynamic
DoS-Defense Framework ($PD^3F$), which employs a two-stage approach to defend
against resource consumption attacks from both the input and output sides. On
the input side, we propose the Resource Index to guide Dynamic Request Polling
Scheduling, thereby reducing resource usage induced by malicious attacks under
high-concurrency scenarios. On the output side, we introduce the Adaptive
End-Based Suppression mechanism, which terminates excessive malicious
generation early. Experiments across six models demonstrate that $PD^3F$
significantly mitigates resource consumption attacks, improving users' access
capacity by up to 500% during adversarial load. $PD^3F$ represents a step
toward the resilient and resource-aware deployment of LLMs against resource
consumption attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种终身安全对齐框架，通过Meta-Attacker和Defender的对抗训练，使LLMs能够持续适应新型越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，新型越狱攻击威胁其安全性，现有防御方法难以应对未知攻击。

Method: 采用对抗训练框架，Meta-Attacker主动发现新攻击策略，Defender抵抗攻击，并利用GPT-4o提取研究论文中的关键见解。

Result: Meta-Attacker首轮攻击成功率为73%，Defender最终将攻击成功率降至7%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了LLMs在开放环境中的安全性，代码已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have made impressive progress, but their growing capabilities also
expose them to highly flexible jailbreaking attacks designed to bypass safety
alignment. While many existing defenses focus on known types of attacks, it is
more critical to prepare LLMs for unseen attacks that may arise during
deployment. To address this, we propose a lifelong safety alignment framework
that enables LLMs to continuously adapt to new and evolving jailbreaking
strategies. Our framework introduces a competitive setup between two
components: a Meta-Attacker, trained to actively discover novel jailbreaking
strategies, and a Defender, trained to resist them. To effectively warm up the
Meta-Attacker, we first leverage the GPT-4o API to extract key insights from a
large collection of jailbreak-related research papers. Through iterative
training, the first iteration Meta-Attacker achieves a 73% attack success rate
(ASR) on RR and a 57% transfer ASR on LAT using only single-turn attacks.
Meanwhile, the Defender progressively improves its robustness and ultimately
reduces the Meta-Attacker's success rate to just 7%, enabling safer and more
reliable deployment of LLMs in open-ended environments. The code is available
at https://github.com/sail-sg/LifelongSafetyAlignment.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（GPT和Llama）在焦虑支持中的潜在效用，发现微调能提升语言质量但增加毒性，GPT整体更支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康支持需求增长，但资源短缺，探索LLMs在焦虑支持中的可行性。

Method: 使用r/Anxiety子论坛的真实用户帖子进行提示和微调，结合语言质量、安全性和支持性的混合评估框架。

Result: 微调提升语言质量但增加毒性和偏见，降低情感响应；GPT整体表现更支持。

Conclusion: 未处理的社交媒体内容微调LLMs存在风险，需缓解策略。

Abstract: The growing demand for accessible mental health support, compounded by
workforce shortages and logistical barriers, has led to increased interest in
utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for scalable and real-time assistance.
However, their use in sensitive domains such as anxiety support remains
underexamined. This study presents a systematic evaluation of LLMs (GPT and
Llama) for their potential utility in anxiety support by using real
user-generated posts from the r/Anxiety subreddit for both prompting and
fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes a mixed-method evaluation framework
incorporating three main categories of criteria: (i) linguistic quality, (ii)
safety and trustworthiness, and (iii) supportiveness. Results show that
fine-tuning LLMs with naturalistic anxiety-related data enhanced linguistic
quality but increased toxicity and bias, and diminished emotional
responsiveness. While LLMs exhibited limited empathy, GPT was evaluated as more
supportive overall. Our findings highlight the risks of fine-tuning LLMs on
unprocessed social media content without mitigation strategies.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 多模态Transformer模型在预测视觉大脑活动方面表现优异，但多模态刺激下的预测准确性仍需研究。本文通过对比单模态和多模态模型，发现多模态模型在语言和视觉区域对齐更优，并揭示了模态间的信息整合机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态模型如何预测大脑活动，尤其是在多模态刺激下，以理解大脑如何处理跨模态信息。

Method: 使用单模态和两种多模态模型（跨模态和联合预训练模型）分析fMRI数据，研究其对电影观看时大脑活动的预测能力。

Result: 多模态模型在语言和视觉区域对齐更优，且模态间存在额外信息整合。跨模态模型主要依赖视频模态，而联合预训练模型则依赖视频和音频模态。

Conclusion: 多模态模型为研究大脑多模态信息处理提供了新视角，推动神经科学领域对模型可解释性的进一步探索。

Abstract: Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or
silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models
can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent
modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these
multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in
multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in
studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such
multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates
information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to
higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and
two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine
which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants
are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal
models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This
study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus
multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each
modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one
by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional
information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and
language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for
cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video
modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the
video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the
neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for
deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.

*Alireza Rezazadeh,Zichao Li,Ange Lou,Yuying Zhao,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“协作记忆”的框架，用于多用户、多代理环境中实现动态、非对称权限下的知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多假设单用户、单代理环境，忽视了多用户间动态、非对称权限下的知识共享需求。

Method: 框架包含两层记忆：私有记忆和共享记忆，通过二分图编码用户、代理和资源的权限关系，并支持不可变的来源属性和细粒度读写策略。

Result: 该框架实现了安全、高效且可解释的跨用户知识共享，并确保对动态权限策略的严格遵守和操作的可审计性。

Conclusion: 协作记忆框架为多用户、多代理环境中的知识共享提供了有效的解决方案，支持动态权限管理和审计。

Abstract: Complex tasks are increasingly delegated to ensembles of specialized
LLM-based agents that reason, communicate, and coordinate actions-both among
themselves and through interactions with external tools, APIs, and databases.
While persistent memory has been shown to enhance single-agent performance,
most approaches assume a monolithic, single-user context-overlooking the
benefits and challenges of knowledge transfer across users under dynamic,
asymmetric permissions. We introduce Collaborative Memory, a framework for
multi-user, multi-agent environments with asymmetric, time-evolving access
controls encoded as bipartite graphs linking users, agents, and resources. Our
system maintains two memory tiers: (1) private memory-private fragments visible
only to their originating user; and (2) shared memory-selectively shared
fragments. Each fragment carries immutable provenance attributes (contributing
agents, accessed resources, and timestamps) to support retrospective permission
checks. Granular read policies enforce current user-agent-resource constraints
and project existing memory fragments into filtered transformed views. Write
policies determine fragment retention and sharing, applying context-aware
transformations to update the memory. Both policies may be designed conditioned
on system, agent, and user-level information. Our framework enables safe,
efficient, and interpretable cross-user knowledge sharing, with provable
adherence to asymmetric, time-varying policies and full auditability of memory
operations.

### [628] [News Without Borders: Domain Adaptation of Multilingual Sentence Embeddings for Cross-lingual News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12634)
*Andreea Iana,Fabian David Schmidt,Goran Glavaš,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新闻适配的句子编码器（NaSE），通过预训练的多语言句子编码器（SE）进行领域专门化，解决了多语言新闻推荐系统中的零样本跨语言迁移（ZS-XLT）问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言新闻消费者数量快速增长，现有神经新闻推荐系统在零样本跨语言迁移中表现不佳，且传统微调方法在数据稀缺时计算成本高。

Method: 构建多语言新闻语料库PolyNews和PolyNewsParallel，提出NaSE方法，结合冻结的NaSE嵌入和后期点击行为融合。

Result: NaSE在零样本跨语言迁移和冷启动新闻推荐中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NaSE为多语言新闻推荐提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，减少了对监督微调的依赖。

Abstract: Rapidly growing numbers of multilingual news consumers pose an increasing
challenge to news recommender systems in terms of providing customized
recommendations. First, existing neural news recommenders, even when powered by
multilingual language models (LMs), suffer substantial performance losses in
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Second, the current paradigm of
fine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is
computationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and
cold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this
work, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized
from a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we
construct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual
news-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test
the effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for
news recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i)
frozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion. We show that NaSE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-XLT in true cold-start and few-shot
news recommendation.

### [629] [Walk&Retrieve: Simple Yet Effective Zero-shot Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Knowledge Graph Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16849)
*Martin Böckling,Heiko Paulheim,Andreea Iana*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Walk&Retrieve是一种基于知识图谱的零样本检索增强生成框架，通过图遍历和知识语言化解决LLM的幻觉和知识过时问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有KG-based RAG方法在表示对齐、检索效率与动态更新方面的不足。

Method: 利用walk-based图遍历和知识语言化生成语料，无需领域微调。

Result: 在响应准确性和幻觉减少上优于现有RAG系统，且查询延迟低、可扩展性强。

Conclusion: Walk&Retrieve展示了轻量级检索策略在RAG研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities,
but often suffer from hallucinations or outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph
(KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remedies these shortcomings by
grounding LLM responses in structured external information from a knowledge
base. However, many KG-based RAG approaches struggle with (i) aligning KG and
textual representations, (ii) balancing retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and
(iii) adapting to dynamically updated KGs. In this work, we introduce
Walk&Retrieve, a simple yet effective KG-based framework that leverages
walk-based graph traversal and knowledge verbalization for corpus generation
for zero-shot RAG. Built around efficient KG walks, our method does not require
fine-tuning on domain-specific data, enabling seamless adaptation to KG
updates, reducing computational overhead, and allowing integration with any
off-the-shelf backbone LLM. Despite its simplicity, Walk&Retrieve performs
competitively, often outperforming existing RAG systems in response accuracy
and hallucination reduction. Moreover, it demonstrates lower query latency and
robust scalability to large KGs, highlighting the potential of lightweight
retrieval strategies as strong baselines for future RAG research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对企业领域数据的可扩展硬负样本挖掘框架，通过动态选择语义挑战性但上下文无关的文档来提升重排序模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业搜索系统因语义不匹配和术语重叠问题导致检索准确性下降，影响下游应用（如知识管理、客户支持等）。

Method: 整合多种嵌入模型，进行降维，并独特选择硬负样本，确保计算效率和语义精度。

Result: 在企业专有语料库（云服务领域）上，MRR@3和MRR@10分别提升15%和19%；在公共数据集（FiQA等）上验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升企业搜索性能方面具有显著效果，并适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Enterprise search systems often struggle to retrieve accurate,
domain-specific information due to semantic mismatches and overlapping
terminologies. These issues can degrade the performance of downstream
applications such as knowledge management, customer support, and
retrieval-augmented generation agents. To address this challenge, we propose a
scalable hard-negative mining framework tailored specifically for
domain-specific enterprise data. Our approach dynamically selects semantically
challenging but contextually irrelevant documents to enhance deployed
re-ranking models.
  Our method integrates diverse embedding models, performs dimensionality
reduction, and uniquely selects hard negatives, ensuring computational
efficiency and semantic precision. Evaluation on our proprietary enterprise
corpus (cloud services domain) demonstrates substantial improvements of 15\% in
MRR@3 and 19\% in MRR@10 compared to state-of-the-art baselines and other
negative sampling techniques. Further validation on public domain-specific
datasets (FiQA, Climate Fever, TechQA) confirms our method's generalizability
and readiness for real-world applications.

*Soyoung Yoon,Gyuwan Kim,Gyu-Hwung Cho,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AcuRank是一个自适应重排序框架，通过动态调整计算量和目标，基于文档相关性的不确定性估计，提升检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定计算量的重排序方法忽视查询难度和文档分布，导致效率低下。

Method: 使用贝叶斯TrueSkill模型迭代优化相关性估计，直到达到足够置信水平。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR基准测试中，AcuRank在准确性和效率之间取得更好平衡，且计算扩展性优于固定计算基线。

Conclusion: AcuRank在多样化检索任务和基于LLM的重排序模型中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) enhances top-ranked
results in retrieval-based applications. Due to the limit in context size and
high inference cost of long context, reranking is typically performed over a
fixed size of small subsets, with the final ranking aggregated from these
partial results. This fixed computation disregards query difficulty and
document distribution, leading to inefficiencies. We propose AcuRank, an
adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and
target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance.
Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates
until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of
ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and
avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions. Results on the TREC-DL and
BEIR benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off and scales better with compute than
fixed-computation baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method across diverse retrieval tasks and LLM-based
reranking models.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出针对阿姆哈拉语的密集检索模型，基于预训练的Amharic BERT和RoBERTa，显著提升了低资源语言的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索低资源、形态丰富的语言（如阿姆哈拉语）在神经检索中的表现，解决数据稀缺和分词问题。

Method: 引入基于预训练Amharic BERT和RoBERTa的密集检索模型，包括RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed和更紧凑的变体，以及ColBERT模型。

Result: RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed在MRR@10和Recall@10上分别提升17.6%和9.86%，ColBERT模型达到最高MRR@10（0.843）。

Conclusion: 语言特定适配对低资源检索至关重要，研究公开了数据集、代码和模型以促进未来工作。

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models
have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their
effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic
remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We
address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based
on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed
RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative
improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest
multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact
variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while
being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction
retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all
evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and
dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in
Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and
underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future
research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and
trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

Motivation: 提升信息检索任务中的重排性能和可解释性，同时减少对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 结合强化学习和数据增强技术，基于Qwen2.5-7B模型开发REARANK-7B。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于基线模型，与GPT-4相当，并在BRIGHT推理密集型任务中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效增强LLM在重排任务中的推理能力，REARANK方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present REARANK, a large language model (LLM)-based listwise reasoning
reranking agent. REARANK explicitly reasons before reranking, significantly
improving both performance and interpretability. Leveraging reinforcement
learning and data augmentation, REARANK achieves substantial improvements over
baseline models across popular information retrieval benchmarks, notably
requiring only 179 annotated samples. Built on top of Qwen2.5-7B, our
REARANK-7B demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4 on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks and even surpasses GPT-4 on reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmarks. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach and
highlight how reinforcement learning can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities in
reranking.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEW的自进化框架，用于自动生成和优化多代理工作流，以解决复杂编码任务，相比仅使用基础LLM，性能提升高达33%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工设计的多代理工作流，无法自动适应不同类型的编码问题，限制了其灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出SEW框架，通过自进化机制自动生成和优化多代理工作流，并在三个编码基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench等数据集上，SEW相比基础LLM性能提升高达33%，并能自动优化工作流设计。

Conclusion: SEW框架通过自进化机制有效解决了手工设计工作流的局限性，为复杂编码任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in code
generation tasks. To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges,
existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic
workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned
to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily
rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts
manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to
different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable
automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving
\textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that
automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive
experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging
LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic
workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\%
improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only.
Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we
provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.

*Wasi Uddin Ahmad,Somshubra Majumdar,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究表明，后处理对LLM在FIM代码生成中的自动评估至关重要，尤其是当输出包含多余代码时。监督微调显著提升了生成代码的质量，但在某些情况下仍需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在FIM代码生成中常生成多余代码，缺乏输出边界意识，因此需要研究后处理的必要性及其优化策略。

Method: 通过监督微调优化LLM（如Qwen2.5-Coder），并在HumanEval Infilling和SAFIM基准上评估其性能。

Result: 微调后的模型在生成完整行代码时表现优异，无需后处理；但在生成随机代码片段时仍需后处理。

Conclusion: 监督微调显著提升LLM的FIM代码生成能力，但后处理在某些场景下仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in
fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of
extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of
awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective
evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often
proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming
languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing
instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning
significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that
seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned
\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and
SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing,
especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However,
post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is
a random span of code.

Motivation: 探讨如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件开发中实现更高效的人机协作，并比较两种范式的优劣势。

Method: 提出详细的分类法，涵盖概念基础、执行模型、反馈机制等，并通过20个用例进行对比分析。

Result: vibe coding适合早期原型设计和教育，agentic coding在自动化、重构和CI/CD中表现优异；未来趋势是混合架构。

Conclusion: 成功的AI软件工程需结合两种范式的优势，构建以人为本的统一开发生命周期。

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in
AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both
leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy,
architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes
intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational
workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In
contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through
goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks
with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning
conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms,
debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative
workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems
thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in
enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We
further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language
interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we
articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed
for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest
that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm,
but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development
lifecycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SIDE、MIDQ、STASIS）在代码注释分析方面存在局限性，需要更全面的质量评估标准。

Method: 提出CIDRe标准，包含四个协同方面：相关性、信息量、完整性和描述长度，并在手动标注数据集上验证。

Result: CIDRe在交叉熵评估中优于现有指标，基于其过滤的注释数据微调的模型在GPT-4o-mini评估中表现出显著质量提升。

Conclusion: CIDRe是一种有效的代码注释质量评估标准，能够显著提升注释质量。

Abstract: Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality
metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS)
suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a
language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic
aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness
(functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections),
and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a
manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over
existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When
applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show
statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在软件开发中的重要性增加，评估其生成结构化输出的能力变得至关重要。

Method: StructEval通过生成任务（从自然语言提示生成结构化输出）和转换任务（在结构化格式之间转换）系统评估结构保真度，并引入新指标。

Result: 结果显示性能差距显著，即使是先进模型如o1-mini平均得分仅75.58，开源模型落后约10分。生成任务比转换任务更具挑战性，生成视觉内容比文本结构更困难。

Conclusion: StructEval为评估LLMs的结构化输出能力提供了全面基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是生成视觉内容的挑战。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to software development
workflows, their ability to generate structured outputs has become critically
important. We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and
renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks,
StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats
through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from
natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between
structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task,
with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results
reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini
achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging
approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than
conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than
generating text-only structures.

Motivation: 机器人操作任务中，复杂的身体动力学使得视觉表示学习具有挑战性，研究旨在通过身体相关线索提升策略学习效率。

Method: ICon是一种应用于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的对比学习方法，通过分离特征空间中的代理特定和环境特定标记，生成代理中心的视觉表示。

Conclusion: ICon通过引入对比损失作为辅助目标，能够有效提升机器人操作任务的视觉表示学习效果。

Abstract: Learning effective visual representations for robotic manipulation remains a
fundamental challenge due to the complex body dynamics involved in action
execution. In this paper, we study how visual representations that carry
body-relevant cues can enable efficient policy learning for downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. We present $\textbf{I}$nter-token $\textbf{Con}$trast
($\textbf{ICon}$), a contrastive learning method applied to the token-level
representations of Vision Transformers (ViTs). ICon enforces a separation in
the feature space between agent-specific and environment-specific tokens,
resulting in agent-centric visual representations that embed body-specific
inductive biases. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into end-to-end
policy learning by incorporating the contrastive loss as an auxiliary
objective. Our experiments show that ICon not only improves policy performance
across various manipulation tasks but also facilitates policy transfer across
different robots. The project website: https://github.com/HenryWJL/icon

Abstract: The field of robotics has made significant strides toward developing
generalist robot manipulation policies. However, evaluating these policies in
real-world scenarios remains time-consuming and challenging, particularly as
the number of tasks scales and environmental conditions change. In this work,
we demonstrate that world models can serve as a scalable, reproducible, and
reliable proxy for real-world robot policy evaluation. A key challenge is
generating accurate policy videos from world models that faithfully reflect the
robot actions. We observe that directly inputting robot actions or using
high-dimensional encoding methods often fails to generate action-following
videos. To address this, we propose Policy2Vec, a simple yet effective approach
to turn a video generation model into a world simulator that follows latent
action to generate the robot video. We then introduce WorldEval, an automated
pipeline designed to evaluate real-world robot policies entirely online.
WorldEval effectively ranks various robot policies and individual checkpoints
within a single policy, and functions as a safety detector to prevent dangerous
actions by newly developed robot models. Through comprehensive paired
evaluations of manipulation policies in real-world environments, we demonstrate
a strong correlation between policy performance in WorldEval and real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, our method significantly outperforms popular methods
such as real-to-sim approach.

Conclusion: VGER框架有效解决了单图像环境表示和运动生成的挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their
surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment.
Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free
motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB
image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular
depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large
pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these
models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped
errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation
Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale
video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the
input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then
input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We
then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation
of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies
with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a
diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to
produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all
from a single RGB input image.
