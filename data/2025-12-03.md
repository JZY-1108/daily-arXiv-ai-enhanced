TL;DR: RxBench是一个针对处方审核的综合性基准测试，包含多种题型，评估了18个前沿LLM，发现领先模型在某些任务上能达到或超过药师水平，并通过微调实现了专业化模型性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在临床决策支持中的快速应用，特别是在处方审核领域，需要建立一个系统化、细粒度的评估框架来全面衡量模型性能，揭示其能力和局限性。

Method: 开发了RxBench基准测试，涵盖常见处方审核类别，整合了14种常见处方错误类型，包含1150道单选题、230道多选题和879道简答题，所有题目均由经验丰富的临床药师审核。评估了18个前沿LLM，并基于评估结果对中等模型进行了针对性微调。

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06、Grok-4-0709和DeepSeek-R1-0528表现最佳，形成第一梯队。领先LLM在某些任务上能达到或超过持证药师水平。通过对中等模型进行微调，得到的专业化模型在简答题任务上能与领先通用LLM媲美。

Conclusion: RxBench建立了一个标准化、以错误类型为导向的评估框架，不仅揭示了前沿LLM在处方审核中的能力和局限性，还为构建更可靠、专业化的临床工具提供了基础资源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from text generators into powerful problem solvers. Yet, many open tasks demand critical thinking, multi-source, and verifiable outputs, which are beyond single-shot prompting or standard retrieval-augmented generation. Recently, numerous studies have explored Deep Research (DR), which aims to combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with external tools, such as search engines, thereby empowering LLMs to act as research agents capable of completing complex, open-ended tasks. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of deep research systems, including a clear roadmap, foundational components, practical implementation techniques, important challenges, and future directions. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows: (i) we formalize a three-stage roadmap and distinguish deep research from related paradigms; (ii) we introduce four key components: query planning, information acquisition, memory management, and answer generation, each paired with fine-grained sub-taxonomies; (iii) we summarize optimization techniques, including prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning; and (iv) we consolidate evaluation criteria and open challenges, aiming to guide and facilitate future development. As the field of deep research continues to evolve rapidly, we are committed to continuously updating this survey to reflect the latest progress in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型快速发展，为特定用例选择最合适模型的过程日益复杂，需要同时考虑定性（模型适用性）和定量（性能表现）两个维度

Method: 通过分析当前排行榜和基准测试来探索定量评估维度，以医疗领域为案例研究，展示评估维度的演变、现状和实际意义，并提出模型选择方法论（MSM）

Result: 建立了对LLM定量评估维度的系统分析框架，展示了医疗领域模型评估的具体实践，提出了指导模型选择的系统化方法

Conclusion: 需要系统化的模型选择方法来应对快速发展的基础模型生态，提出的MSM框架为特定用例选择最合适模型提供了实用指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become one of the most transformative tools across many applications, as they have significantly boosted productivity and achieved impressive results in various domains such as finance, healthcare, education, telecommunications, and law, among others. Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension. Finally, we propose a Model Selection Methodology (MSM), a systematic approach designed to guide the navigation, prioritization, and selection of the model that best aligns with a given use case.

TL;DR: CCD是一种新的扩散语言模型推理框架，通过轨迹校正机制和自适应采样策略，在提高生成质量的同时加速推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型推理方法依赖局部即时指标（如置信度或熵），缺乏更可靠的全局视角，导致采样轨迹不一致和生成质量欠佳。

Method: 提出CCD框架：1）轨迹校正机制，利用历史上下文增强序列连贯性，早期拒绝次优路径；2）自适应采样策略，根据一致性度量动态调整每个步骤的解码预算。

Result: 在Dream和LLaDA基准测试中，方法在推理速度和性能上同时提升，达到3.48倍加速和3.91%性能改进。

Conclusion: CCD通过理论驱动的轨迹校正和自适应预算分配，显著改善了扩散语言模型的推理效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

TL;DR: 提出基于可逆动力学的内存高效LLM架构，通过时间可逆性避免存储中间激活值，大幅降低内存消耗，并可将现有非可逆LLM转换为可逆架构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练成本高昂且耗时，标准架构需要存储所有中间激活值导致内存消耗大，限制了批处理大小和训练效率

Method: 1. 受对称和辛微分方程启发设计可逆架构；2. 利用时间可逆动力学在反向传播时重建隐藏状态；3. 提出将现有非可逆LLM转换为可逆架构的微调方法

Result: 在多个数据集和基准测试上获得可比或改进的性能，显著降低内存消耗，允许更大的批处理大小，提高训练吞吐量

Conclusion: 可逆架构为LLM训练和微调提供了可扩展且高效的内存优化路径，平衡了性能与资源消耗

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文探索了内存高效微调方法在语音方言识别任务中的应用，相比传统微调和参数高效微调，显著降低了GPU内存使用并加速了训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言识别有助于改进下游语音任务，但传统微调方法计算成本和内存需求高。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然参数效率高，但在内存效率和训练速度方面改进有限。

Method: 将最初为语言处理设计的内存高效微调方法应用于通用预训练语音模型，并全面分析不同MEFT方法的GPU内存使用和微调速度。以Whisper模型在KeSpeech数据集上的六种普通话子方言识别为案例研究。

Result: GPU内存使用最多减少73.25%，训练速度提升2.1倍，同时保持与传统微调和PEFT方法相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 内存高效微调方法在语音方言识别任务中具有显著优势，能够在保持性能的同时大幅降低资源消耗，为资源受限环境下的语音模型微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种数据高效的BERT微调策略，通过TF-IDF样本选择减少75%训练数据，同时添加领域特定词汇增强检测能力，在保持性能的同时提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的辱骂性言论持续演变，新俚语和混淆术语不断出现以规避检测系统，需要更高效、适应性强的检测方法

Method: 1) 基于TF-IDF的样本选择机制，保留最具信息量的75%训练样本；2) 增强BERT分词器，添加辱骂语境中的领域特定俚语和词汇变体

Result: 在广泛使用的仇恨言论数据集上，该方法在保持竞争性性能的同时显著提高了计算效率

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和自适应的辱骂内容审核提供了潜力，通过数据高效微调和词汇增强解决了辱骂言论检测中的持续演变挑战

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: RESP框架通过自生成校准、解码梯度重要性估计和渐进再生，显著提升了推理LLMs的结构化剪枝效果，在保持高准确率的同时实现20-40%的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理LLMs（如o1、DeepSeek-R1、Qwen3）虽然推理能力强，但模型大、解码输出长，部署成本高且不适合资源受限环境。现有剪枝方法对推理LLMs效果差，即使中等稀疏度（20%）也会严重损害准确性和推理连贯性。

Method: 提出RESP自反思结构化剪枝框架：1）使用模型自生成推理轨迹作为校准数据（而非人工标注）；2）解码梯度重要性估计；3）渐进再生机制，在稀疏度增加时保持校准保真度。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上，RESP显著优于现有结构化剪枝方法：在GSM8K和MathQA上，20-30%稀疏度时保持接近密集模型的准确率；40%稀疏度时，GSM8K准确率81.3%（比最强基线高66.87%），MathQA准确率59.6%（比最强基线高47%）。

Conclusion: RESP通过将剪枝决策与模型推理动态对齐，解决了推理LLMs剪枝的脆弱性问题，为资源受限环境部署高效推理模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLMs) such as OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3 deliver strong multi-step reasoning through chain-of-thought generation, but their large model sizes and lengthy decode-time outputs make them costly to deploy and unsuitable for resource-constrained settings. To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

TL;DR: LiteReason是一种轻量级潜在推理方法，通过推理投影器生成连续潜在token来"跳过"推理步骤，结合RL优化，在保持性能的同时大幅减少推理长度(77-92%)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通过生成长推理链处理复杂任务，但使用RL优化推理能力计算成本高昂，特别是在涉及大量token检索和处理的叙事相关任务中。

Method: 提出LiteReason方法：1) 使用轻量级推理投影器模块生成连续潜在token来"跳过"推理步骤；2) 在RL训练中，策略模型决定何时激活投影器，在潜在推理和离散推理之间切换；3) 可与标准token采样交错使用。

Result: 在情节漏洞检测和书籍章节生成任务上，LiteReason优于潜在推理基线方法，接近非潜在RL训练的性能，同时将最终推理长度减少77-92%，在性能-计算权衡曲线上达到更高效的位置。

Conclusion: LiteReason通过结合潜在推理和RL，在保持任务性能的同时显著减少计算开销，为LLMs的高效推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks. Our results highlight the need for adaptive prompting strategies and provide tools and data to support further research.

Motivation: 气候适应策略对维持农业生产至关重要，但相关信息分散在结构化（政府API）和非结构化（科学文献）数据源中，专家难以获取可信的初步答案

Method: 提出CAIRNS框架：1）使用结构化ScholarGuide提示增强可读性和引用可靠性；2）采用一致性加权混合评估器，结合模型间一致性和专家判断进行鲁棒评估

Conclusion: CAIRNS框架无需微调或强化学习即可实现可读、可验证、领域基础的气候适应问答，为农业专家提供可靠的信息获取工具

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

TL;DR: 研究人员创建了HealthContradict数据集来评估语言模型在矛盾生物医学上下文中的推理能力，发现微调后的生物医学模型既能利用正确上下文，又能抵抗错误上下文的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何使用上下文信息回答健康问题，以及当上下文存在矛盾时模型的反应如何。现有医学问答评估基准在区分模型上下文推理能力方面有限，需要更精细的评估工具。

Method: 创建HealthContradict数据集（920个专家验证实例，每个包含健康问题、科学证据支持的答案和两个矛盾立场的文档）。采用多种提示设置（正确、错误或矛盾上下文），测量对模型输出的影响。

Result: HealthContradict相比现有医学问答基准能更好地区分语言模型的上下文推理能力。实验显示微调生物医学语言模型的优势不仅在于预训练获得的参数知识，还在于其利用正确上下文同时抵抗错误上下文的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了评估语言模型在矛盾生物医学上下文中推理能力的新工具，揭示了微调生物医学模型在上下文利用和抵抗方面的双重优势，对医学AI应用有重要意义。

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

### [15] [When Does Verification Pay Off? A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02304)
*Jack Lu,Ryan Teehan,Jinran Jin,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了37个LLM在9个基准测试上的验证能力，发现跨模型族验证效果最佳，后训练减少自我改进但增强跨族改进，数学和逻辑任务具有最高可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM作为问题求解器和解决方案验证器的交互作用探索有限，主要关注自我验证，很少研究验证器如何评判同族或异族模型的输出。同时，现代LLM经过大量后训练，但其对验证能力的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用37个模型（涵盖多个模型族、不同规模和基础vs后训练变体），在9个基准测试（逻辑推理、结构化谜题、符号计算、数学、常识、事实回忆和领域知识）上进行评估。比较自我验证、同族验证和跨族验证，并引入并经验验证了"验证器增益"指标来预测测试时基于验证器的拒绝采样带来的性能改进。

Result: 跨模型族验证特别有效；后训练减少自我改进但增强跨族改进；数学和逻辑任务表现出最高的固有可验证性。验证器增益和误报率随模型规模和后训练而变化，不同数据集的可验证性存在差异。

Conclusion: 系统研究表明跨模型族验证是提升LLM性能的有效策略，后训练对验证能力有复杂影响，任务类型影响可验证性，为LLM验证机制的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗政策、政府福利等敏感领域的QA系统中存在事实一致性和上下文对齐问题，需要集成异构知识源并确保准确性和安全性

Method: 提出KARMA框架：1) 双编码器架构融合结构化和非结构化知识源；2) 门控记忆单元动态调节外部知识集成；3) 安全感知可控解码器通过安全分类和引导生成技术减少不安全输出

Result: 在专有QA数据集上的实验表明，KARMA在答案质量和安全性方面均优于强基线模型

Conclusion: KARMA为服务场景中构建可信赖和自适应的QA系统提供了全面解决方案

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering (QA) systems for services face unique challenges in integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources while ensuring both accuracy and safety. Existing large language models often struggle with factual consistency and context alignment in sensitive domains such as healthcare policies and government welfare. In this work, we introduce Knowledge-Aware Reasoning and Memory-Augmented Adaptation (KARMA), a novel framework designed to enhance QA performance in care scenarios. KARMA incorporates a dual-encoder architecture to fuse structured and unstructured knowledge sources, a gated memory unit to dynamically regulate external knowledge integration, and a safety-aware controllable decoder that mitigates unsafe outputs using safety classification and guided generation techniques. Extensive experiments on a proprietary QA dataset demonstrate that KARMA outperforms strong baselines in both answer quality and safety. This study offers a comprehensive solution for building trustworthy and adaptive QA systems in service contexts.

Motivation: 现有故事生成系统难以准确将用户意图转化为满意输出，缺乏细粒度控制和明确输入规范，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将故事结构分解为四个基本单元（实体、事件、关系、故事大纲），使用Tinystories数据集构建9,851个JSON格式偏好数据集，微调本地Llama模型，采用JSON2Story方法将结构化数据转化为连贯故事。

Result: 开发了直观界面支持用户创建编辑实体和事件，通过拖放等简单交互控制故事细节和进展，提供七个维度的评估和优化建议，支持迭代调整。

Conclusion: 定量评估和用户研究证明了TaleFrame的有效性，数据集已公开，为可控故事生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of natural language generation (NLG) technologies, creative story generation systems have gained increasing attention. However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了在线虚假信息检测的两个实际任务：虚假新闻检测和病毒性预测。结果显示文本内容对虚假新闻检测效果显著，而病毒性预测更具挑战性且对标签构建高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于评估在线虚假信息检测在操作环境中的实际应用需求，特别是在需要快速反应的场景下。当前研究需要平衡模型性能与计算资源限制，并解决病毒性预测中的标签构建难题。

Method: 使用EVONS和FakeNewsNet数据集，比较文本嵌入（RoBERTa、Mistral）与轻量级数值特征（时间、关注者数、验证状态、点赞数）以及序列模型（GRU、门控架构、Transformer编码器）。采用中位数分割法定义"病毒性"标签，并进行降维分析（t-SNE vs PCA）。

Result: 文本内容对虚假新闻检测效果显著，而仅使用数值特征的管道在语言模型不可用或计算受限时仍可行。病毒性预测比虚假新闻检测困难得多，对标签构建高度敏感。降维分析显示非线性结构对病毒性预测更有信息量。RoBERTa和Mistral嵌入结果差异不大。

Conclusion: 文本模型在虚假新闻检测中表现优异，但轻量级数值特征在资源受限时仍具实用性。病毒性预测需要更精细的标签定义和评估设计。研究强调了评估方法设计的重要性，并指出了当前API限制带来的实际挑战。

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

Motivation: 电商搜索相关性建模面临两个主要挑战：1) 传统词匹配方法（如BM25）存在语义鸿沟；2) 神经网络模型依赖稀缺的领域特定困难样本。需要一种能克服数据稀缺、增强推理能力的方法。

Method: ADORE框架包含三个创新模块：1) 规则感知相关性判别模块：使用思维链LLM生成意图对齐的训练数据，通过Kahneman-Tversky优化对齐用户行为；2) 错误类型感知数据合成模块：自动生成对抗样本来增强鲁棒性；3) 关键属性增强知识蒸馏模块：将领域特定属性层次注入可部署的学生模型。

Conclusion: ADORE通过自动化标注、对抗生成和蒸馏过程，克服了数据稀缺问题，同时增强了推理能力，为工业应用中的相关性建模提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在训练早期就混合正负优势信号，可能导致模糊的指导信号和有限的性能提升，需要更精细的训练策略。

Method: CAPO采用自适应课程机制：1）先用正优势样本进行模仿学习建立坚实基础；2）再逐步引入负优势信号培养判别能力；3）兼容多种优化方法（GRPO、PPO、RLOO、Reinforce++）。

Result: 在数学推理任务上实现稳定显著的性能提升，并能有效泛化到多模态GUI推理场景，证明其作为通用优化框架的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAPO通过优势信号驱动的课程学习机制，为强化学习训练大语言模型提供了更有效的优化框架，在单模态和多模态推理任务中均表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在生成多文档摘要时存在显著的首因效应，摘要更偏向于第一个看到的文档，这对依赖LLM生成概述的应用和智能体系统构成风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）被广泛用于多文档摘要任务（如Google AI Overviews），但尚不清楚它们是否对所有输入文档给予同等权重。本研究旨在探究LLM在多文档摘要中是否存在位置偏见。

Method: 聚焦堕胎相关新闻，构建40个支持-中立-反对立场的文章三元组，每个三元组以6种不同顺序排列。使用Gemini 2.5 Flash生成中性概述，通过ROUGE-L（词汇重叠）、BERTScore（语义相似度）和SummaC（事实一致性）评估摘要与源文章的关系。采用单因素方差分析和配对比较分析位置效应。

Result: BERTScore显示所有立场都存在显著的首因效应，摘要与第一个看到的文章语义更一致。配对比较显示位置1与位置2、3有显著差异，而位置2和3之间无差异，证实了LLM对第一个文档的选择性偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在多文档摘要中存在位置偏见，更倾向于第一个输入文档。这对依赖LLM生成概述的应用和智能体系统构成风险，因为LLM步骤可能对下游行动产生不成比例的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

TL;DR: 本文实证调查了7种模型合并算法在减少LLM社会偏见方面的效果，发现偏见减少与下游任务性能之间存在权衡关系，其中SLERP在中等插值权重下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会继承甚至放大预训练语料中的社会偏见，威胁公平性和社会信任。虽然已有研究探索通过编辑LLM参数来减轻偏见，但缺乏对不同模型合并算法的实证比较。

Method: 实证调查7种模型合并算法（Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, Nearswap），应用于GPT、LLaMA和Qwen家族的13个开源权重模型。使用3个偏见数据集（BBQ、BOLD、HONEST）进行综合评估，并在SuperGLUE基准测试中测量这些技术对下游任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现偏见减少与下游性能之间存在权衡关系：偏见减轻程度更大的方法会降低准确性，特别是在需要阅读理解、常识和因果推理的任务上。在合并算法中，Linear、SLERP和Nearswap能持续减少偏见同时保持整体性能，其中中等插值权重的SLERP是最平衡的选择。

Conclusion: 模型合并算法在偏见减轻方面具有潜力，但过度的去偏见化或不适当的合并方法可能导致重要语言能力的退化。SLERP在中等权重下提供了最佳的平衡方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

### [26] [CREST: Universal Safety Guardrails Through Cluster-Guided Cross-Lingual Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02711)
*Lavish Bansal,Naman Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST是一个参数高效的多语言安全分类模型，仅用0.5B参数支持100种语言，通过在13种高资源语言上训练实现跨语言迁移，在安全基准测试中表现优于同类模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防护主要针对高资源语言，导致使用低资源语言的大量人口无法获得足够的安全保护，需要开发能服务全球人口的通用安全系统

Method: 提出CREST模型，采用参数高效设计，仅在13种高资源语言上训练，通过基于聚类的跨语言迁移技术，将安全能力扩展到100种语言（包括未见过的低资源语言）

Result: 在六个安全基准测试中，CREST优于同等规模的现有防护模型，并与参数大5倍以上（2.5B+）的模型竞争，证明了跨语言迁移的有效性

Conclusion: 语言特定的安全防护存在局限性，需要开发通用、语言无关的安全系统，以有效扩展到服务全球人口，CREST为此提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过心理物理学范式评估LLMs是否像人类一样进行最优贝叶斯多模态整合，发现能力与策略存在关键分离，准确率不能保证鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在显式推理方面表现出色，但其隐式计算策略尚未充分探索。人类在感知任务中能使用近乎最优的贝叶斯策略直觉处理噪声信号，研究想知道LLMs是否表现出类似行为，在没有显式训练或指令的情况下进行最优多模态整合

Method: 采用心理物理学范式，通过系统行为研究推断LLMs的计算原理。引入行为基准BayesBench：四个基于文本和图像的幅度估计任务（长度、位置、距离、持续时间），评估九个不同LLMs并与人类判断校准。通过控制噪声、上下文和指令提示的消融实验，测量多模态线索组合的性能、行为和效率

Result: 结果显示，虽然能力强的模型经常以贝叶斯一致的方式适应，但准确率不能保证鲁棒性。值得注意的是，GPT-5 Mini在文本准确率上达到完美，但未能有效整合视觉线索。这揭示了能力与策略之间的关键分离，表明以准确率为中心的基准可能过度关注性能而忽略了脆弱的确定性处理

Conclusion: 研究发现LLMs出现了对不确定性的原则性处理，并揭示了准确率与贝叶斯倾向之间的相关性。研究发布了心理物理学基准和一致性度量作为评估工具，为未来多模态架构设计提供信息

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

TL;DR: SurveyEval：一个用于评估LLM自动生成调研报告的综合基准，从整体质量、大纲连贯性和参考文献准确性三个维度进行评测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自动调研系统通过检索、组织和内容合成形成端到端生成流程，如何评估这种复杂系统成为一个重要挑战。现有研究主要关注开发新生成流程，但缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出SurveyEval基准，从三个维度评估自动生成的调研报告：整体质量、大纲连贯性、参考文献准确性。扩展7个学科领域，并增强LLM-as-a-Judge框架，加入人类参考以加强评估与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 评估结果显示，通用长文本或论文写作系统倾向于生成质量较低的调研报告，而专门的调研生成系统能够提供显著更高质量的结果。

Conclusion: SurveyEval可作为可扩展的测试平台，用于理解和改进跨不同学科和评估标准的自动调研系统。

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address the increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, many newly introduced PEFT methods are challenging to replicate, deploy, or compare with one another. To address this, we introduce PEFT-Factory, a unified framework for efficient fine-tuning LLMs using both off-the-shelf and custom PEFT methods. While its modular design supports extensibility, it natively provides a representative set of 19 PEFT methods, 27 classification and text generation datasets addressing 12 tasks, and both standard and PEFT-specific evaluation metrics. As a result, PEFT-Factory provides a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment, improving replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods. PEFT-Factory is a downstream framework that originates from the popular LLaMA-Factory, and is publicly available at https://github.com/kinit-sk/PEFT-Factory

Result: 实验发现：1) 无单一范式绝对优越；2) 两种方法捕捉不同错误面；3) 混合方法达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: 需要统一幻觉检测与事实核查的研究议程，两者互补，整合方法效果最佳

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有对话式广义指代表达理解系统面临训练与评估领域间的分布偏移问题，且标注对话数据稀缺，限制了模型性能

Method: 采用三层数据合成方法，平衡真实性和可控性，为对话条件化的指代理解任务生成可扩展的监督数据

Result: 在合成数据上微调的模型在标准评估指标上相比先前方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: 通过平衡真实性和可控性的数据合成方法，可以有效解决对话式广义指代表达理解任务中的数据稀缺和分布偏移问题

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex框架通过三阶段检索增强方法扩展低资源非洲语言情感词典，提升情感分析性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源非洲语言在情感分析中代表性不足，限制了多语言NLP系统的词汇覆盖和性能

Method: 提出TriLex三阶段检索增强框架：1) 基于语料库的提取；2) 跨语言映射；3) RAG驱动的词汇精炼。使用扩展词典评估AfroXLMR和AfriBERTa模型

Result: AfroXLMR表现最佳，在isiXhosa和isiZulu上F1分数超过80%，跨语言稳定性强。AfriBERTa虽未预训练目标语言，仍达到约64%的F1分数。两种模型均优于传统机器学习基线，集成分析进一步提升精度和鲁棒性

Conclusion: TriLex是扩展低资源南非语言多语言情感词典和情感建模的可扩展有效框架

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

TL;DR: 提出stable rank作为无需人工标注的LLM质量信号，通过模型内部表征的几何特性衡量回答质量，并基于此开发SR-GRPO强化学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖外部监督存在诸多问题：人工标注稀缺且主观，奖励模型易受奖励攻击，自评估方法存在提示敏感性和偏见。需要寻找无需外部监督的内在质量信号

Method: 提出stable rank概念，通过计算隐藏状态的总方差与主导方向方差之比来衡量表征的有效维度，捕捉信息在维度间的分布特性。基于此开发SR-GRPO强化学习方法，使用stable rank作为奖励信号

Result: stable rank在RewardBench上达到84.04%准确率，通过Best-of-N采样比贪婪解码平均提升11.3个百分点。SR-GRPO将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct在STEM任务上提升10%，数学推理提升19%，优于学习型奖励模型和自评估基线

Conclusion: 质量信号可以从模型内部几何结构中提取，为无需外部监督的可扩展对齐提供了新路径，stable rank作为内在质量信号具有实用价值

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT为评估LLM在中医临床辨证论治能力提供了全面基准，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，有助于推动智能中医研究的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言的仇恨言论识别面临数据集不足、拼写异质性和语言多样性等挑战。孟加拉语作为超过2.3亿人使用的语言，在计算资源方面代表性不足，而社交媒体平台对自动化内容审核的需求日益增长。

Method: 研究了BLP 2025共享任务的子任务1A和1B。复现了官方基线方法（多数投票、随机、支持向量机），并增加了逻辑回归、随机森林和决策树作为基线。同时使用了基于Transformer的模型：DistilBERT、BanglaBERT、m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行仇恨言论分类。

Result: 所有基于Transformer的模型（除DistilBERT外）在子任务中都优于基线方法。在Transformer模型中，BanglaBERT在两个子任务中都取得了最佳性能。尽管规模较小，BanglaBERT的表现超过了m-BERT和XLM-RoBERTa，这表明语言特定的预训练非常重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了预训练语言模型在低资源孟加拉语中的潜力和必要性，语言特定的预训练对于提升性能至关重要。

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages remains a difficult problem due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the growing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under-represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official baselines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vector Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. We also utilized transformer-based models such as DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods for the subtasks, except for DistilBERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language-specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

Motivation: 多数投票法在封闭式问答中有效，但不适用于代码生成和深度网络研究等开放端推理任务，因为这些任务中"多数"解决方案难以定义

Method: 提出ThinkMerge解码策略：运行K个并行推理轨迹，在同步点平均它们的下一个token的logits，生成单个连贯输出；与vLLM/SGLang无缝集成，兼容Top-p/Top-k等标准解码技术

Result: 在AIME和GPQA上匹配或超越多数投票法；在LiveCodeBench（hard）上，DeepCoder-14B-Preview的pass@1提升+8.28%，Qwen3-8B提升+7.58%；在GAIA、BrowseComp-en/zh和XbenchDeepSearch上改进基于网络的深度研究代理

Conclusion: 并行测试时扩展可以在不依赖完整输出投票的情况下有益于开放端推理，ThinkMerge为开放端推理任务提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SchED是一种无需训练、模型无关的提前退出算法，通过聚合全跨度logit边界并在满足平滑进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码，显著加速扩散大语言模型推理，在保持性能的同时实现3.8-4.0倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)相比自回归模型具有潜力，但其迭代采样过程缓慢，严重限制了实际应用。需要一种高效的方法来加速dLLM的解码过程，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 提出SchED算法：1) 无需训练且模型无关；2) 聚合全跨度logit边界；3) 当满足平滑进度相关置信度阈值时停止解码；4) 在Dream和LLaDA两个dLLM家族上进行评估，包括基础版和指令调优版。

Result: 在指令调优模型上实现3.8-4.0倍加速，同时保持99.8-100%基线分数；在基础模型上实现一致加速增益，性能保持99.1-100%，激进设置下可达2.34倍加速。在QPS(γ=4)指标下明显优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SchED通过将真正的置信度稳定转化为计算节省，使dLLM解码显著更高效。指令调优加速了预测熵的衰减，进一步提升了算法效果。该方法在长文本生成任务中表现稳健，优于现有置信度提前退出方法。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

TL;DR: AutoNeural：专为NPU设计的视觉语言模型架构，通过MobileNetV5风格视觉编码器和SSM-Transformer混合语言模型，实现整数推理和线性复杂度，显著提升边缘AI效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有为GPU设计的视觉语言模型在NPU上表现不佳，主要原因是ViT量化脆弱性和自回归注意力机制的I/O限制，无法充分利用NPU的高算术吞吐量

Method: 1) 用MobileNetV5风格的深度可分离卷积替换ViT编码器，确保激活分布有界以支持稳定INT4/8/16量化；2) 语言模型结合状态空间模型原理和Transformer层，使用门控卷积实现线性时间复杂度，消除KV缓存的内存I/O开销

Result: 视觉编码器量化误差降低7倍，端到端延迟降低14倍，解码速度提升3倍，上下文窗口长度提升4倍。在Qualcomm SA8295P SoC上的汽车案例验证了驾驶舱应用的实时性能

Conclusion: 针对NPU约束重新设计模型拓扑是实现鲁棒多模态边缘智能的前提条件，AutoNeural展示了硬件感知模型设计的有效性

Abstract: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个结合传统NLP技术、自定义语法和微调语言模型的框架，将英语句子转换为逻辑表达式再转为CNF形式，以减少LLM在逻辑翻译中的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在自然语言到形式逻辑的自动翻译中存在幻觉问题，影响逻辑翻译的精确性，需要可靠的方法来生成CNF用于可满足性求解

Method: 结合传统NLP技术（自定义语法）、符号计算库和微调语言模型，将英语句子转换为逻辑表达式，再翻译为CNF形式

Result: 微调模型能够有意识地纠正原始模型的相同类型幻觉，提供可靠的CNF生成

Conclusion: 该框架通过混合方法有效减少LLM在逻辑翻译任务中的幻觉，为自动推理和软件规范验证提供可靠支持

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

TL;DR: MoCoP：无需数据集的闭环框架，用于持续评估和解释LLM的道德一致性，揭示道德稳定性与语言安全性的强相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐框架依赖静态数据集和事后评估，难以捕捉LLM在不同情境和时间尺度上的道德推理演变，需要动态、持续的道德一致性评估方法

Method: 提出Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP)框架，包含三个支持层：词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计、基于推理的判断建模，形成自主生成、评估和精炼道德场景的自维持架构

Result: 在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上的实验显示，MoCoP有效捕捉纵向道德行为，道德维度与毒性维度呈强负相关(rET=-0.81)，与响应延迟几乎无关(rEL≈0)

Conclusion: 道德一致性和语言安全性是模型行为的稳定可解释特征，MoCoP为可扩展的持续审计提供了可重复基础，推进了自主AI系统中计算道德的研究

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究通过微调TerraMind地理空间基础模型，结合Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学多模态数据，提升了全球洪水范围制图的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最具破坏性的天气灾害之一，2024年极端洪水事件影响五大洲。虽然地球观测卫星提供了关键的洪水监测数据，但现有模型的准确性严重依赖标注数据集和泛化能力。新兴的地理空间基础模型（GFMs）通过大规模自监督预训练提高了泛化性，但其在全球多样化洪水事件中的表现尚不清楚。

Method: 使用FloodsNet数据集（包含全球85个洪水事件的Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学协同定位影像）微调TerraMind模型。测试了四种配置（基础vs大型模型；冻结vs解冻骨干网络），并与TerraMind Sen1Floods11示例以及基于FloodsNet和Sen1Floods11训练的U-Net进行对比。

Result: 基础解冻配置在准确性、精确度和召回率方面达到最佳平衡，计算成本显著低于大型模型。大型解冻模型获得最高召回率。FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练的示例，总体准确性相似。U-Net比所有GFM配置具有更高的召回率，但准确性和精确度略低。

Conclusion: 整合多模态光学和SAR数据并微调GFM可以增强近实时洪水制图能力。本研究首次在全球范围内评估GFM用于洪水分割的潜力，突出了其在气候适应和灾害韧性方面的应用前景和当前局限性。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

TL;DR: 提出上下文增强对比损失函数，通过两个收敛目标改进对比学习效果并解决信息失真问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习中的对比损失函数可能导致信息失真，模型过度依赖相同标签样本的信息，而忽略来自同一原始图像的正样本对，特别是在大规模数据集中

Method: 提出上下文增强对比损失函数，包含两个组件：1) 对标签对比敏感的组件，区分相同和不同类别的特征；2) 拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，同时远离所有其他样本

Result: 在8个大规模基准数据集上评估，相比16种最先进的对比学习方法，在泛化性能和学习收敛速度方面都有改进。在BiasedMNIST数据集上比原始对比损失函数提升22.9%

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决对比学习中的信息失真问题，提高训练效率和公平性，特别在处理系统性失真任务方面表现突出

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

TL;DR: 提出一个联合评估文本到图像生成模型和视觉语言模型的结构化方法，通过测试VLM能否识别T2I模型生成的图像中的27种特定错误模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型在生成图像时经常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性（如对象数量和颜色），而VLM的基准测试未能跟上复杂场景的需求，需要更精细的评估框架

Method: 设计结构化方法，使用挑战性提示让5个T2I模型生成图像，然后让3个VLM模型识别图像中的27种特定错误模式，最后用LLM标注VLM的识别结果是否正确

Result: 创建了包含提示、生成图像和VLM标注的数据集，揭示了T2I模型在属性保真度和对象表示方面的系统性错误，发现当前评估指标不足以捕捉这些细微错误

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试来提升生成模型的可靠性和可解释性，当前评估方法存在不足，需要更精细的层次化评估框架

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗依赖于早期诊断，医学影像和基因信息在诊断中分别起不同作用。为了利用医学影像早期预测基因突变，帮助更早选择治疗方案，需要建立跨模态模型。

Method: 1. 将病灶图像转换为点云表示以获得模态不变性；2. 提出LLOST模型：双变分自编码器通过共享潜在空间耦合病灶点云和体细胞突变计数特征；3. 使用条件归一化流先验学习三个潜在空间以适应各域分布多样性。

Result: 在TCIA医学影像和TCGA Pan Cancer体细胞突变数据集上验证：1. 能预测特定突变计数；2. 能准确预测突变发生；3. 发现影像与突变域之间的共享模式反映癌症类型。

Conclusion: 模型展示了从医学影像预测基因突变的可行性，未来可改进模型并扩展到其他遗传学领域，为早期癌症诊断和治疗选择提供支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

TL;DR: SplatSuRe：一种选择性应用超分辨率的方法，只在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域添加SR内容，从而提高3D高斯泼溅的渲染质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低分辨率输入视图上统一应用超分辨率会导致多视图不一致和模糊渲染。关键洞察是：近距离LR视图可能包含远处视图也捕获区域的高频信息，可以利用相机姿态相对于场景几何的信息来决定在哪里添加SR内容。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe方法，选择性应用SR内容，只在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域添加超分辨率内容。通过分析相机姿态与场景几何的相对关系，识别哪些区域需要增强。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上，该方法在保真度和感知质量方面均超越基线方法。在需要更高细节的局部前景区域，改进最为显著。

Conclusion: 选择性应用超分辨率内容的方法比统一应用SR更有效，能够产生更清晰、更一致的渲染结果，特别是在需要高细节的区域。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

TL;DR: 提出RobustSurg方法，通过利用手术场景的风格和内容信息来提升跨中心和跨模态的泛化能力，在未见数据集上获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习手术场景分割方法在单中心单模态数据上表现良好，但难以泛化到未见分布（其他中心）和未见模态。自然场景的域泛化方法不能直接应用于手术场景，因为手术场景视觉线索有限且场景极其多样

Method: 1. 利用实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术来获得鲁棒和可泛化的特征表示；2. 引入恢复模块在ResNet骨干网络中，保留与任务相关的有用特征；3. 提供新策划的多类多中心数据集

Result: 在HeiCholSeg未见中心数据集上，相比基线DeepLabv3+提升近23%，相比SOTA提升10-32%（mIoU）；在EndoUDA息肉数据集目标集上，相比基线提升近22%，相比近期SOTA提升近11%

Conclusion: 通过利用手术场景的风格和内容信息，结合实例归一化、特征协方差映射和恢复模块，能够显著提升手术场景分割的跨域泛化能力，为手术场景分割的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种归纳先验方法：单分形和多分形重校准，通过分析指数概率质量与多分形谱的关系来形成编码器嵌入的统计描述，在卷积网络中实现为通道注意力函数，在医学图像分割任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多分形方法依赖重池化或强特征空间抽取，限制了语义分割等任务的应用。多分形分析在捕捉病理规律方面具有优势，但在现代深度学习中使用有限。

Method: 提出两种归纳先验：单分形重校准和多分形重校准。利用指数概率质量与多分形谱之间的关系形成编码器嵌入的统计描述，实现为卷积网络中的通道注意力函数。基于U-Net框架进行验证。

Result: 在三个公共医学影像数据集（ISIC18皮肤镜、Kvasir-SEG内窥镜、BUSI超声）上验证，多分形重校准相比使用高阶统计的其他通道注意力机制基线有显著提升。发现注意力层响应在U-Net中不会随编码器深度增加而特化，其有效性可能与实例变异性的全局统计相关。

Conclusion: 多分形重校准方法有效提升了医学图像分割性能，为多分形分析在深度学习中的应用提供了新思路，同时揭示了U-Net架构中注意力层的行为特性。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

TL;DR: 提出Unified-VQA框架，通过诊断性专家混合模型解决通用视频质量评估问题，提供全局质量评分和可解释的多维伪影向量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法存在三个主要问题：1）单一质量分数无法提供诊断性反馈；2）大多是格式特定的专用指标而非通用解决方案；3）从不同感知域学习妥协表示

Method: 提出Unified-VQA框架，采用诊断性专家混合模型，包含多个针对不同感知域的"感知专家"，使用新颖的多代理专家训练策略，并集成诊断性多任务头生成全局质量分数和可解释伪影向量

Result: 在静态模型参数下（无需重新训练或微调），Unified-VQA在17个包含HD、UHD、HDR和HFR格式的数据库上，相比18个基准方法在通用VQA和诊断伪影检测任务中表现一致且优越

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向实用、可操作和可解释的视频质量评估迈出的重要一步，提供了统一的解决方案

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work.

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench是一个专注于说话人中心视听推理的基准测试，包含3212个多选题，评估模型在真实视频中理解谁在说话、说了什么、何时说话的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试很少评估对人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务要么可以通过视觉解决，要么只粗粒度评估语音，无法深入了解模型是否能对齐说话人、内容和时间。

Method: 创建AV-SpeakerBench基准测试，具有三个特点：1) 以说话人为核心推理单元而非场景；2) 融合基础的问题设计，将视听依赖嵌入问题语义；3) 专家标注确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: Gemini系列模型表现最佳，Gemini 2.5 Pro达到最好结果。开源模型中，Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但仍远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要原因是视听融合能力较弱而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统的细粒度视听推理建立了严谨的基础，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络在低层视觉任务中尚未充分探索，传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解能力，且存在频域饱和限制

Method: 提出视觉LIF神经元，设计脉冲分解增强模块和轻量级脉冲多尺度单元，实现层次化多尺度表示学习

Result: 在五个基准去雨数据集上显著超越现有SNN方法，能耗仅为传统方法的13%

Conclusion: 为在低层视觉任务中部署高性能、高能效的SNN奠定了坚实基础

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SPF（时空金字塔流）方法，通过分层建模时空尺度实现高效、并行的气候模拟，在ClimateBench上超越现有方法，并构建了最大的气候模拟数据集ClimateSuite。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式气候模拟方法依赖天气尺度自回归，存在计算慢、长时程不稳定、难以处理非平稳强迫等问题，需要更高效稳定的气候模拟方法。

Method: 提出时空金字塔流（SPF）方法：1）将生成轨迹划分为时空金字塔结构；2）渐进增加空间分辨率减少计算；3）每个阶段耦合特定时间尺度，支持任意时间层级直接采样；4）每个阶段以物理强迫（温室气体、气溶胶等）为条件。

Result: 在ClimateBench上，SPF在年和月尺度上优于现有流匹配基线和预训练模型，采样速度快（尤其在粗时间尺度）。构建ClimateSuite数据集（33,000+模拟年，10个气候模型，首次包含气候干预模拟），SPF模型在跨气候模型场景中表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF和ClimateSuite为跨时间尺度和现实未来场景的准确、高效、概率性气候模拟奠定了基础，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在时间生成方面表现出色，但其在图像修复方面的潜力尚未充分探索。作者希望利用这些模型的时间生成能力来进行渐进式视觉修复。

Method: 1. 微调CogVideo模型生成修复轨迹而非自然视频运动；2. 构建合成数据集（超分辨率、去模糊、低光增强），每个样本展示从退化到清晰帧的渐进过渡；3. 比较两种提示策略：统一文本提示和基于LLaVA多模态LLM生成的场景特定提示。

Result: 微调后的模型能够将时间进程与修复质量关联，生成改善PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标的序列。模型有效恢复空间细节和光照一致性，同时保持时间连贯性。在ReLoBlur数据集上无需额外训练即可泛化到真实场景，展示出强大的零样本鲁棒性和通过时间修复的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过重新利用文本到视频模型进行渐进式视觉修复是可行的，模型能够学习将时间进程与修复质量关联，并在多种修复任务上表现出色，同时具备良好的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR油污分割模型在不同海域（如地中海和秘鲁海岸）间泛化能力差，主要由于海况、后向散射统计特征和油污形态的差异，且秘鲁地区标注数据稀缺

Method: 两阶段合成增强框架：阶段A使用形态学区域扰动（曲率引导的标签空间方法）生成油污和类似区域的几何变化；阶段B使用条件生成INADE模型从编辑后的掩码渲染SAR纹理

Result: 在秘鲁数据集（2112个标注patch）上评估，预训练模型从67.8% mIoU降至51.8%；MORP-Synth提升性能达+6 mIoU，并显著改善少数类IoU（油污+10.8，类似区域+14.6）

Conclusion: MORP-Synth有效缓解了SAR油污分割模型的跨区域泛化问题，特别是在标注数据稀缺的秘鲁海岸，通过合成数据增强显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型隐含学习到有效的运动表示，可用于构建高性能自我监督跟踪器，特别擅长区分视觉相似物体，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Motivation: CNN在SAR任务中表现出色，但其内部机制复杂不透明，难以满足高可靠性要求，限制了在SAR领域的应用。提高CNN的可解释性对其在SAR中的发展和部署至关重要。

Method: 提出多权重自匹配类激活映射（MS-CAM）方法，将SAR图像与CNN提取的特征图和对应梯度进行匹配，结合通道权重和元素权重来可视化模型在SAR图像中的决策依据。

Result: 在自建的SAR目标分类数据集上的实验表明，MS-CAM能更准确地突出网络的关注区域，捕捉详细的目标特征信息，从而增强网络可解释性。同时验证了MS-CAM在弱监督目标定位中的可行性，并深入分析了像素阈值等影响定位精度的关键因素。

Conclusion: MS-CAM方法有效提升了CNN在SAR图像中的可解释性，为SAR应用中的高可靠性要求提供了解决方案，并为弱监督目标定位等后续工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型虽然整合了理解和生成能力，但带来了推理效率问题——特定任务或样本可能不需要模型的全部知识和容量。目前对模型不同组件效率问题的系统性理解有限。

Method: 1) 使用训练无关的剪枝作为探测方法，系统分析统一多模态模型组件（深度剪枝和宽度缩减）；2) 提出混合专家(MoE)适配方法，将生成模块划分为多个专家并启用稀疏激活；3) 通过专家冻结调优和完全可训练适配验证有效性。

Result: 研究发现：理解组件在理解和生成任务中都表现出显著压缩性，在生成任务中更明显；生成组件对压缩高度敏感，即使中等压缩比也会导致性能急剧下降。MoE适配方法使BAGEL模型在仅激活约一半参数的情况下达到与完整模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析揭示了统一多模态模型组件的不同压缩特性，提出的MoE适配方法有效解决了生成组件的效率瓶颈，实现了在保持性能的同时显著减少激活参数，为高效多模态模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

Conclusion: WSCF-MVCC通过弱监督和自监督技术，在无需昂贵标注和相机标定下实现高效多视角人群计数，更具实用性。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

*Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Peifeng Zhang,Haohuan Fu,Juepeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种在隐私约束下提升语义分割模型泛化能力的方法，通过合成视觉提示而非微调模型权重来适应不同域的风格变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，由于隐私和安全约束，无法访问模型参数和架构细节，传统微调方法受限，需要不修改模型权重的输入级策略来提升泛化能力。

Method: SAGE框架通过风格转移构建源域的多样化风格表示，学习覆盖广泛视觉特征的风格特征集，然后根据每个输入的视觉上下文自适应融合这些风格线索，形成动态提示来协调图像外观而不触及模型内部。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，SAGE在隐私约束下实现了与最先进方法竞争或更优的性能，在所有设置中都优于完全微调基线。

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见域多样性之间的差距，为隐私约束下的域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出On-the-fly Feedback SfM框架，实现无人机实时摄影测量，通过探索-利用机制在飞行中提供重建质量反馈并优化采集路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线无人机摄影测量无法满足灾害响应等时间敏感应用需求，现有实时方法缺乏对3D重建质量的在线评估和采集指导反馈。

Method: 基于SfM on-the-fly，集成三个模块：1) 在线增量粗网格生成；2) 带可操作指标的在线网格质量评估；3) 预测性路径规划用于飞行中轨迹优化。

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现近实时原位重建和评估，提供可操作反馈显著减少覆盖缺口和重复飞行成本。

Conclusion: 通过整合数据采集、处理、3D重建评估和在线反馈，该框架为从传统被动工作模式向智能自适应探索工作流转型提供了替代方案。

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDTA提出了一种从检测到关联的显式特征精炼框架，通过空间、时间和身份适配器增强目标嵌入的判别性，解决端到端多目标跟踪中关联准确率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多目标跟踪方法虽然检测性能强，但关联准确率相对较低。研究发现，共享DETR架构生成的目标嵌入具有过高的目标间相似性，因为它只强调单帧内的类别级区分，而跟踪需要跨帧的实例级区分以及时空连续性。

Method: 提出FDTA框架，通过三个互补视角增强目标判别性：1) 空间适配器(SA)集成深度感知线索实现空间连续性；2) 时间适配器(TA)聚合历史信息建立时间依赖；3) 身份适配器(IA)利用质量感知对比学习实现实例级可分离性。

Result: 在多个挑战性MOT基准测试（DanceTrack、SportsMOT、BFT）上实现了最先进的性能，证明了所提出的判别性嵌入增强策略的有效性。

Conclusion: FDTA通过显式特征精炼框架有效解决了端到端多目标跟踪中关联准确率低的问题，通过空间、时间和身份三个维度的适配器显著提升了目标嵌入的判别能力。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气下具有鲁棒感知潜力，但雷达语义分割进展受限于开源数据集和标签的稀缺。现有RaDelft数据集仅提供LiDAR标注且无公开代码，限制了可复现性和下游研究。

Method: 通过将雷达点云投影到基于相机的语义分割结果中，并应用空间聚类，创建相机引导的雷达标注流程，无需依赖人工标注。

Result: 成功复现了RaDelft组的数值结果，生成的雷达标签显著提高了标注准确性，建立了可复现框架供研究社区训练和评估标注的4D雷达数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为雷达语义分割提供了可复现的标注解决方案，同时研究了不同雾度水平对雷达标注性能的影响，推动了4D雷达感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Motivation: 现有方法将图像操作和网络搜索视为分离能力，过度依赖昂贵的强化学习，且缺乏基于实际工具执行轨迹的规划。

Method: 使用少于30,000条高质量、规划-执行一致的轨迹进行监督微调，通过逐步一致性过滤验证，实现多模态规划、主动图像操作、深度多模态搜索和交替推理。

Conclusion: 精心设计的监督学习单独就能实现复杂的多模态智能体智能，无需依赖强化学习，展示了通过高质量数据训练实现高级推理能力的可行性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

Conclusion: MitUNet为自动化3D重建管道提供了鲁棒的数据准备工具，特别适用于需要高精度墙体分割的室内空间重建任务

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

TL;DR: BOLT：一种基于正交基的低秩迁移框架，通过复用已有微调模型的任务特定谱基，实现少量参数的新任务适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临挑战：元学习方法需要额外元训练阶段且成本高不稳定；大量任务特定预训练模型未被充分利用。需要探索如何以最小额外训练成本将已有模型迁移到新任务

Method: BOLT框架分两阶段：离线阶段从多个任务向量提取主导奇异方向并正交化形成可重用基；在线阶段冻结这些基，仅训练每层少量对角系数，实现秩控制的参数高效更新

Result: BOLT提供：1）无需训练的新任务强初始化（通过池化源任务系数和轻量重缩放）；2）参数高效微调路径，在实验中相比常见PEFT基线和元学习初始化表现稳健

Conclusion: 将适应约束在任务特定的正交子空间为未见任务迁移提供了有效替代方案，BOLT框架在数据计算受限下实现了高效模型复用

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)增强SNNs的时序建模能力，包含Spiking Encoder生成多样化输入刺激和Attention Gating Module引导生成，并提出Spike-Driven Attention降低注意力能耗，在目标检测任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNNs通常直接复制输入或固定间隔聚合输入，导致神经元在不同时间步接收几乎相同的刺激，严重限制了模型表达能力，特别是在目标检测等复杂任务中。

Method: 提出Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)，包含两个模块：1) Spiking Encoder (SE)生成跨时间步的多样化输入刺激；2) Attention Gating Module (AGM)基于时间间依赖关系指导SE生成。为降低AGM引入的高能耗乘法操作，提出Spike-Driven Attention (SDA)减少注意力相关能耗。

Result: TDE可无缝集成到现有SNN检测器中，在静态PASCAL VOC数据集上达到57.7% mAP50-95，在神经形态EvDET200K数据集上达到47.6%。SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE通过增强SNNs的时序信息建模能力，解决了现有方法输入刺激单一的问题，同时通过SDA有效降低了注意力机制能耗，在目标检测任务中实现了性能与能效的双重提升。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Conclusion: nuScenes数据集是自动驾驶发展的关键基础设施，通过提供多模态传感器数据、标准化基准和多样化任务，推动了整个领域的发展。该论文为理解nuScenes的创建、影响和应用提供了全面参考。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Method: 1) 引入HouseLayout3D真实世界基准数据集，支持全建筑尺度布局估计；2) 提出MultiFloor3D训练免费基线方法，利用最新场景理解技术

Result: MultiFloor3D在HouseLayout3D基准和现有数据集上都优于现有3D布局估计模型，突显了该方向进一步研究的必要性

Conclusion: 需要开发能够处理多楼层建筑完整布局估计的新方法，HouseLayout3D数据集和MultiFloor3D基线为此方向提供了基础

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格化运动生成模型虽然能理解特定风格信息并将其插入内容运动，但难以捕捉同一风格内的多样性（intra-style diversity），即单一风格应对应多种运动变化

Method: 提出基于聚类的ClusterStyle框架，使用原型集合建模同一风格类别内运动的多样风格模式。考虑全局级（风格运动间）和局部级（运动序列内时序动态）两种风格多样性，构建全局和局部两个结构化风格嵌入空间，通过与非学习原型锚点对齐优化。使用风格调制适配器（SMA）增强预训练文本到运动生成模型以集成风格特征

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在风格化运动生成和运动风格迁移任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: ClusterStyle通过结构化原型建模有效解决了风格内多样性问题，提升了风格化运动生成的质量和多样性

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

Method: 提出See-Think-Learn自训练框架：1）结构化推理模板（先"看"后"想"）；2）联合改进感知和推理的自训练循环；3）添加负向理由增强判别能力

Result: 在多个领域实验中，STL始终优于仅基于答案或自生成推理的基线方法，定性分析证实其理由的高质量

Conclusion: STL为增强视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力提供了一个经济有效的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Method: 提出参数高效的AVFullDiT架构，利用预训练的文本到视频和文本到音频模块进行联合去噪训练，并与纯视频模型在相同设置下对比

Result: 首次系统证明音频-视频联合去噪能带来超越同步性的改进，在具有大运动和物体接触的挑战性子集上表现一致提升

Conclusion: 音频预测作为特权信号，鼓励模型内化视觉事件与其声学后果之间的因果关系，从而正则化视频动态，跨模态协同训练是开发更强、更物理基础的世界模型的有前景方法

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Method: 提出3DSPMR方法，利用已探索区域的关系、视觉和几何线索来增强多模态大语言模型的空间理解与推理能力，首次将几何信息显式融入MLLM的空间推理框架。

Result: 在SEER-Bench基准上的大量实验表明，3DSPMR方法在序列化EQA和EMN任务上均取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统研究了序列化具身探索与推理挑战，提出的SEER-Bench基准和3DSPMR方法为这一重要但未被充分探索的研究方向奠定了基础，展示了将几何信息融入MLLM进行空间推理的有效性。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

Method: TGDD将分布匹配重新定义为沿模型训练轨迹的动态对齐过程，在每个训练阶段对齐合成数据与原始数据的特征分布，并引入分布约束正则化减少类别重叠。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD实现了最先进的性能，特别是在高分辨率基准上获得了5.0%的准确率提升，且没有增加额外的优化开销。

Conclusion: TGDD通过动态对齐训练轨迹中的特征分布，有效保持了合成数据的语义多样性和代表性，在性能与效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Conclusion: WorldPack通过压缩记忆机制有效解决了视频世界模型长期建模的计算瓶颈，实现了更高效、更一致的长期视觉预测

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学诊断中存在推理脱离问题，即语言解释与可验证的图像证据脱节，影响临床信任。现有的多智能体框架虽然能缓解单模型偏见，但开放式讨论会放大文本噪声和计算成本，且未能将推理锚定在视觉证据上。

Method: UCAgents采用层次化多智能体框架，受临床工作流程启发，禁止立场改变并将智能体交互限制在目标证据验证上。引入单轮询问讨论来发现视觉-文本错位的潜在风险，通过信息论形式化双重噪声瓶颈，共同约束视觉模糊性和文本噪声。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准测试中，UCAgents在PathVQA上达到71.3%的准确率，比最先进方法提升6.0%，同时降低87.7%的token成本。评估结果证实UCAgents在发现更多视觉证据和避免混淆性文本干扰之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: UCAgents展示了诊断可靠性和计算效率的平衡，这对于现实世界临床部署至关重要。该框架通过结构化证据审计和单向收敛机制，有效解决了医学VLM中的推理脱离问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM是一种简单有效的掩码策略，无需架构修改或额外参数，通过适应3D场景空间结构显著提升3D场景语言理解性能

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了基于深度学习和高斯混合模型的部分到部分点集配准方法中特征向量不变性的问题，提出了注意力参考点偏移层(ARPS)来解决这些问题，显著提升了DeepGMR和UGMMReg的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在部分到部分点集配准中，当输入点集发生平移和旋转时，特征向量不变性对基于深度学习和高斯混合模型方法的影响。特别关注DeepGMR等方法的局限性，旨在揭示问题根源并提出可理解的解决方案。

Method: 提出了注意力参考点偏移层(ARPS)，该层使用经过充分研究的注意力模块来寻找两个部分点集的共同参考点，而不是重叠区域。这种方法能够获取变换不变的特征，从而增强DeepGMR及其变体UGMMReg的性能。

Result: ARPS层显著提升了DeepGMR和UGMMReg的性能，这些扩展模型甚至超越了先前使用注意力块和Transformer来提取重叠区域或共同参考点的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为使用深度学习和高斯混合模型的配准方法提供了更深入的见解，表明通过注意力机制寻找共同参考点而非重叠区域，能够有效解决部分到部分点集配准中的变换不变性问题。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

TL;DR: MedSeg-TTA是一个全面的医学图像分割测试时适应基准，系统评估了20种方法在7种模态下的表现，发现不同范式在不同条件下各有优劣，强调了临床部署中方法选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像分割的测试时适应评估存在局限性：模态覆盖不足、任务多样性不够、方法评估不一致。需要建立统一基准来系统比较不同适应范式的可靠性和适用性。

Method: 创建MedSeg-TTA基准，包含7种医学影像模态（MRI、CT、超声、病理、皮肤镜、OCT、胸片），统一数据预处理、骨干网络配置和测试协议。评估4种适应范式：输入级变换、特征级对齐、输出级正则化和先验估计。

Result: 没有单一范式在所有条件下表现最佳：输入级方法在轻微外观变化下更稳定；特征级和输出级方法在边界相关指标上优势更大；先验方法表现出强烈的模态依赖性。许多方法在大规模跨中心、跨设备变化下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA为医学图像分割的测试时适应研究提供了标准化基准，强调了临床部署中需要根据具体条件选择适当方法，并为未来开发鲁棒、临床可靠的适应方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Motivation: 自回归模型与地理空间理解的内在并行性存在结构错配，强制将场景转化为刚性序列叙事，阻碍了结构化、连贯输出的生成

Method: 将地理空间生成重构为并行细化过程，实现从粗到细的整体合成，同时解析所有语义元素；引入GeoDiT——首个面向地理空间领域的扩散视觉语言模型

Result: GeoDiT在需要结构化、以对象为中心输出的基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平；在图像描述、视觉定位和多对象检测任务上取得显著提升

Conclusion: 将生成过程与数据内在结构对齐是解锁复杂地理空间分析中卓越性能的关键

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）在计算机视觉中仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。作者旨在探索如何通过自监督预训练策略提升Vision Transformer在图像恢复任务中的性能。

Method: 提出ViT-SR方法，采用两阶段训练策略：1）自监督预训练阶段，在着色任务上学习通用视觉表示；2）微调阶段，针对4倍超分辨率任务进行调整，通过预测高频残差图像来简化残差学习。

Result: 在DIV2K基准数据集上，ViT-SR取得了SSIM 0.712和PSNR 22.90 dB的优异结果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练策略和自监督预训练对复杂图像恢复任务具有显著效果，未来可通过更大的ViT架构或不同的预训练任务进一步提升性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Motivation: 现有方法将复杂的动态、因果和时序交互推理简化为潜在嵌入，导致推理链不透明且难以追踪。需要一种显式分解的推理方法，使推理过程可解释和可追踪。

Method: 采用显式分解视角，将推理分解为三个顺序操作：语义解释、时序证据选择和空间定位，利用预训练视觉语言模型的原生接口执行推理。使用强化学习优化多步推理链，使模型能够从结果驱动的信号中自我优化决策质量。

Result: 在标准视频目标分割基准测试中达到最先进的性能，并产生可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过显式分解推理步骤和强化学习优化，ReVSeg不仅提升了视频目标分割的性能，还提供了透明可解释的推理过程，解决了现有方法推理链不透明的问题。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的两步加速方案，通过分析VGGT和π³模型中全局注意力模块的作用，将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，并对全局注意力进行子采样，实现了8-10倍推理加速，同时保持或略微提升原始模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DUSt3R、VGGT和π³等多视图3D模型虽然性能强大，但过度依赖全局自注意力导致计算成本高昂。现有稀疏注意力变体只能提供部分加速，且缺乏对全局注意力在多视图推理中作用的系统性分析。

Method: 1. 深入分析VGGT和π³中全局注意力模块的作用，发现交替全局帧架构中角色分工：早期全局层不形成有意义的对应关系，中间层执行跨视图对齐，最后层仅提供微小细化。2. 基于这些发现提出无需训练的两步加速方案：(1)将早期全局层转换为帧注意力；(2)通过对补丁令牌进行子采样（保留对角线并包含均值填充组件）来子采样全局注意力。

Result: 该方法在VGGT和π³上实现，在标准姿态和点云基准测试中，推理时间获得8-10倍加速，同时匹配或略微提升原始模型精度。即使在先前稀疏注意力基线失败的极端密集多视图设置中，该方法仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析全局注意力在多视图3D模型中的作用，提出的训练免费加速方案能显著提升推理效率而不损失精度，为高效多视图3D推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Method: 提出CIA攻击方法，采用多智能体系统，通过四种可视化策略将有害查询嵌入看似良性的视觉上下文，并结合上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型的毒性评分分别达到4.73和4.83，攻击成功率分别达到86.31%和91.07%，显著优于先前工作

Conclusion: 视觉模态本身是越狱先进多模态大语言模型的有效载体，CIA方法展示了图像中心攻击的潜力

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: OmniPerson为可见光/红外图像/视频ReID任务提供了首个统一的身份保持行人生成框架，通过高质量数据生成有效解决了ReID训练数据不足的问题，并将开源代码、预训练模型和PersonSyn数据集。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型与运动图检索相结合的方法有效解决了音频-手势多对多映射问题，能够生成更同步、更自然的协同语音手势视频。

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要大量小高斯基元来表示精细外观细节，当几何和外观具有不同频率特性时会造成资源浪费。受纹理映射传统启发，作者希望用纹理来更高效地表示细节外观

Method: 提出为2D高斯基元引入自适应纹理映射，根据图像采样频率限制纹理大小，并在优化过程中自适应调整纹理分辨率（上采样或下采样），同时基于纹理分辨率控制基元数量

Conclusion: 通过结合纹理映射的自适应高斯泼溅方法，能够更高效地表示3D场景的细节外观，在保持高质量的同时减少参数数量

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

TL;DR: RULER-Bench：首个专门评估视频生成模型规则推理能力的基准，涵盖6类规则40个任务，发现当前SOTA模型规则一致性仅48.87%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成评估主要关注视觉感知和理解（美学、指令遵循、时序一致性），但缺乏对规则推理能力的系统评估。虽然近期有初步探索视频模型作为零样本学习者的能力，但仍缺少细粒度推理能力分解和全面评估方案。

Method: 构建RULER-Bench基准，基于文本到视频和图像到视频两种范式，涵盖6类规则40个代表性任务，包含622个高质量标注实例。使用包含4个指标的检查表，并利用GPT-4o进行评分，与人工判断一致性达85%。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的视频生成模型在规则一致性指标上仅达到48.87%，显示下一代视频模型在推理能力方面仍有巨大改进空间。

Conclusion: RULER-Bench填补了视频生成模型规则推理能力评估的空白，其洞察将促进推理感知的视频生成发展，推动视频生成模型向视觉基础智能迈进。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPTBench：首个针对PowerPoint的多模态基准测试，评估MLLM在幻灯片检测、理解、修改和生成任务中的视觉布局推理能力，揭示当前模型在空间布局理解上的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注狭窄的子任务，忽视了布局理解这一幻灯片创建和编辑的核心挑战。PowerPoint结合了丰富的文本内容和结构化视觉布局，是评估现代MLLM多模态推理和布局理解能力的理想测试平台。

Method: 基于958个PPTX文件构建PPTBench基准测试，包含4,439个样本，涵盖四个任务类别：检测、理解、修改和生成。通过实验评估MLLM在语义理解和视觉布局推理方面的表现，并进行消融分析和案例研究。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLM在语义理解和视觉布局推理之间存在显著差距：模型能解释幻灯片内容，但无法生成连贯的空间布局安排。模型难以结合视觉线索与JSON布局结构，也无法将视觉信息整合到API规划能力中。案例研究揭示了系统性布局错误，如错位和元素重叠。

Conclusion: PPTBench为评估VLLM在PPT场景中的表现提供了新视角，突显了视觉结构推理和连贯幻灯片生成方面的挑战，为未来研究指明了方向。所有数据集和代码已完全开源以支持可重复性和后续研究。

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

TL;DR: SelVA是一个文本条件选择性视频到音频生成模型，能从多对象视频中仅生成用户指定的声音，解决了现有方法生成混合声音的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体制作中需要对每个声源单独处理音频轨道以实现精确编辑、混音和创意控制，但现有方法一次性生成混合声音，主要因为视觉特征纠缠且区域提示难以指定特定声源。

Method: 提出SelVA模型，将文本提示作为目标声源的显式选择器，调制视频编码器以提取提示相关的视频特征；使用补充令牌通过抑制文本无关激活来促进跨注意力；采用自增强方案解决单声道音频监督数据缺乏问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准测试中，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面表现优异，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SelVA成功实现了文本条件选择性视频到音频生成，为多媒体制作提供了精确的音频控制能力。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs如ColPali只能返回整页文档，缺乏精确区域检索能力；OCR系统虽有坐标信息但缺乏语义相关性评估。两者结合可解决RAG中精确上下文检索的需求

Method: 1) 建立视觉Transformer补丁网格与OCR边界框的坐标映射；2) 使用ColPali补丁级相似度分数作为空间相关性过滤器；3) 引入交集度量进行相关性传播；4) 建立检索精度的理论边界

Result: 提出Snappy开源实现，无需额外训练即可在推理时运行，正在进行实证评估

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉语义相似度与OCR结构化坐标，实现了文档区域级精确检索，解决了RAG中精确上下文获取的关键问题

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Conclusion: 这是首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架，为复杂反射场景建模提供了优越的可解释性和实时性能

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: UAUTrack通过统一的跨模态协作框架和文本提示策略，有效解决了反无人机跟踪中的多模态融合挑战，为反无人机跟踪提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR通过结合渐进式剪枝和相位引导机制，成功实现了轻量级扩散超分辨率，在效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Conclusion: 显式的前景建模和伪掩码指导对于鲁棒的场景分解和物体中心表示学习至关重要，FASA框架有效解决了背景干扰和前景过分割问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ClimaOoD增强了模型鲁棒性，为开放世界异常检测提供了有价值的训练数据，有助于实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

TL;DR: GeoBridge是一个跨视角地理定位基础模型，通过语义锚机制实现多视角双向匹配和语言-图像检索，解决了传统卫星中心方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卫星中心的地理定位方法在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性有限，且未能充分利用跨视角（无人机、卫星、街景）和多模态（语言、图像）的互补信息。

Method: 提出GeoBridge基础模型，采用新颖的语义锚机制，通过文本描述桥接多视角特征；构建了首个大规模跨模态多视角对齐数据集GeoLoc（包含5万+对图像和文本描述）。

Result: 实验证实GeoLoc预训练显著提高了GeoBridge的地理定位精度，同时促进了跨领域泛化和跨模态知识迁移。

Conclusion: GeoBridge通过语义锚机制和GeoLoc数据集，实现了更鲁棒、灵活的地理定位，超越了传统卫星中心范式，支持多视角双向匹配和语言-图像检索。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner是一种无需训练的视觉语言模型token剪枝算法，通过离心式剪枝范式平衡冗余和空间稀疏性，在88.9%剪枝率下保持性能并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型token剪枝方法存在三个问题：1) 仅依赖token重要性而忽略token间冗余，保留大量重复token浪费计算资源；2) 冗余感知方法忽视token空间关系，导致保留token过于稀疏无法覆盖目标对象区域；3) 需要训练过程增加部署成本。

Method: 提出VLM-Pruner训练免费token剪枝算法：1) 离心式token剪枝范式，实现从近到远选择同时优先保留细粒度对象细节；2) 空间稀疏性缓冲(BSS)准则，延迟选择空间距离较远的token；3) 并行贪婪策略高效进行token选择；4) 选择性融合被丢弃token的显著信息到保留token中。

Result: 在5个不同VLM模型上，VLM-Pruner在88.9%的高剪枝率下持续优于强基线方法，同时实现了端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner通过平衡冗余和空间稀疏性，在无需训练的情况下有效剪枝视觉语言模型，显著降低计算成本同时保持模型性能，适合移动设备部署。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于性别分层的全身MR图像配准方法，使用VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪和肌肉掩膜增强基于强度的图割配准，在UK Biobank数据上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UK Biobank收集了大量全身MR图像和非成像健康数据，需要准确的主体间图像配准来实现全身空间标准化，并分析非成像数据与图像衍生参数（如组织体积或脂肪含量）的相关性。

Method: 提出性别分层的全身MR图像配准方法，使用VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪和肌肉掩膜来增强基于强度的图割配准，与仅使用强度的方法以及uniGradICON和MIRTK两种现有方法进行比较。

Result: 提出的方法在4000名受试者上评估，男性/女性平均Dice分数分别为0.77/0.75，比仅强度配准高6个百分点，比uniGradICON高9/8个百分点，比MIRTK高12/13个百分点，标签错误频率在大多数组织区域降低，年龄相关性图谱噪声更少且解剖对齐更好。

Conclusion: 使用两种组织掩膜的图像配准方法显著改善了UK Biobank图像的全身配准质量，为医学研究提供了更可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content). We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research. The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment. In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

Conclusion: GeoViS通过渐进式搜索推理框架有效解决了遥感图像中微小目标检测和复杂空间关系理解的挑战，为遥感视觉定位提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出DF-Mamba框架，利用状态空间建模（Mamba）和可变形状态扫描来改进3D手部姿态估计中的特征提取，特别针对严重遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常手部交互中存在严重遮挡（如双手重叠），需要鲁棒的特征学习。现有3D手部姿态估计方法多依赖ResNet等CNN，其归纳偏置可能不适合3D HPE，因为CNN建模全局上下文的能力有限。

Method: 提出Deformable Mamba（DF-Mamba）框架，结合Mamba的选择性状态建模和可变形状态扫描。可变形扫描在聚合卷积后的局部特征时，选择性保留代表全局上下文的线索。

Result: 在五个不同数据集（单手/双手、手部/手物交互、RGB/深度）上评估，DF-Mamba优于VMamba、Spatial-Mamba等最新图像骨干网络，在所有数据集上达到SOTA性能，推理速度与ResNet-50相当。

Conclusion: DF-Mamba通过Mamba的选择性状态建模和可变形扫描，有效捕捉全局上下文，显著提升结构化3D手部姿态估计的准确性，为解决遮挡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有无人机定位方法需要大量配对的无人机-卫星图像数据集进行训练，但这类数据获取成本高且往往不可得，限制了应用范围

Method: 采用无需无人机图像的训练范式，仅从卫星参考图像学习，通过专门的增强策略模拟卫星视图与真实无人机视图之间的视觉域偏移，提出CAEVL模型

Result: 在发布的ViLD真实无人机图像数据集上验证，性能与使用配对数据训练的方法相当，展示了有效性和强泛化能力

Conclusion: CAEVL方法通过创新的训练范式和增强策略，解决了无人机定位中数据获取难题，为GNSS拒止环境下的无人机自主性提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: RAMF框架通过创新的多模态融合和对抗推理机制，有效解决了视频仇恨言论检测中的语义融合和微妙意图理解问题，展现出强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，准确检测甲烷排放对应对气候变化至关重要。传统方法依赖B11和B12波段的差异或比值，但会产生大量误报需要专家验证。现有深度学习方法缺乏针对甲烷特征的优先级机制。

Conclusion: AttMetNet首次将NDMI与注意力增强U-Net结合，创建了专门针对真实卫星图像中甲烷羽流检测的架构，显著提高了检测性能，为甲烷排放监测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

Conclusion: 通过区分烟雾类型并针对性处理，STANet能有效去除腹腔镜视频中的烟雾，提升手术视觉引导质量，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

Conclusion: LumiX通过结构化扩散框架成功实现了多个内在属性图的联合生成，确保了物理一致性和结构连贯性，在文本到内在属性生成任务上超越了现有技术。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Motivation: 闭源与开源多模态模型性能差距扩大，主要由于缺乏大规模高质量训练数据和能诊断多样化编辑行为的综合基准。现有数据构建方法面临规模与质量的权衡。

Method: 1) 轻量级数据管道：用端到端模型替代多工具链，统一后验证阶段；2) 训练7B双任务专家模型Qwen-Verify进行失败检测和指令重写；3) 构建10M规模UnicEdit-10M数据集；4) 提出UnicBench基准，评估空间和知识驱动推理；5) 引入新指标：非编辑一致性和推理准确性。

Conclusion: 通过创新的数据管道和基准设计，解决了多模态图像编辑中的数据质量和评估挑战，为开源模型发展提供了重要基础设施。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出HUD框架，利用视频与文本信息密度差异解决组合视频检索中的指代歧义和语义聚焦问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVR方法忽视了视频与文本模态间的信息密度差异，导致修改主体指代歧义和详细语义聚焦有限的问题

Method: 提出分层不确定性感知消歧网络(HUD)，包含整体代词消歧、原子不确定性建模、整体到原子对齐三个关键组件

Result: 在CVR和CIR任务的三个基准数据集上均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: HUD框架通过利用模态信息密度差异，有效解决指代歧义和语义聚焦问题，实现精确的组合特征学习

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

TL;DR: IC-World是一个基于视频的世界建模框架，能够从一组输入图像并行生成多个视频，保持场景几何和物体运动的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频世界模型在合成动态视觉环境方面受到关注，但现有方法在共享世界建模方面存在不足，即从同一底层世界在不同相机姿态下生成多个视频时，难以保持几何和运动的一致性。

Method: 提出IC-World框架：1）利用大视频模型的内在上下文生成能力实现并行生成；2）通过强化学习（Group Relative Policy Optimization）微调；3）引入两个新奖励模型来强制场景级几何一致性和物体级运动一致性。

Result: IC-World在几何一致性和运动一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，是首个系统探索基于视频模型的共享世界建模问题的工作。

Conclusion: IC-World成功解决了共享世界建模中的一致性挑战，通过激活大视频模型的上下文生成能力并结合强化学习优化，实现了高质量的并行视频生成。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

TL;DR: 提出PhyCustom框架，通过两种正则化损失激活扩散模型进行物理概念定制，解决现有方法在物理属性生成上的不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在具体概念（如风格、形状）上取得成功，但在物理概念定制方面存在不足。核心问题是训练过程中缺乏明确的物理知识引入，导致即使输入提示包含物理相关词汇，生成结果也无法准确反映相应物理属性。

Method: 提出PhyCustom微调框架，包含两种新颖的正则化损失：1）等距损失（isometric loss）激活扩散模型学习物理概念；2）解耦损失（decouple loss）消除独立概念的混合学习

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理概念定制方面在定量和定性上都优于先前的最先进方法和流行方法

Conclusion: PhyCustom框架通过引入物理知识正则化损失，有效解决了扩散模型在物理概念定制方面的局限性，为文本到图像生成中的物理属性控制提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 对抗训练意外地增加了对抗样本的可迁移性，这带来了新的生态系统风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对抗训练是提高模型鲁棒性的主要防御方法，但其对攻击可迁移性的影响尚未充分研究。本文旨在探究对抗训练是否会无意中增加对抗样本的可迁移性。

Method: 训练了包含CNN和ViT在内的36个多样化模型，进行了全面的可迁移性实验，并发布了所有模型、代码和实验脚本以确保可复现性。

Result: 发现了一个明显的悖论：对抗训练模型产生的扰动比标准模型产生的扰动具有更强的可迁移性，这引入了新的生态系统风险。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性评估不仅应评估模型对迁移攻击的抵抗能力，还应评估其产生可迁移对抗样本的倾向性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

<details>

Motivation: 人类观察单帧场景即可预测后续动作，但传统方法依赖视频时序信息。研究探索能否用替代模态替代视频聚合，实现单帧动作预测

Method: AAG方法结合单帧RGB特征和深度线索增强空间推理，融入先验动作信息提供长期上下文（来自VLM文本摘要或单帧动作识别器预测）

Result: 在IKEA-ASM、Meccano、Assembly101三个教学活动中，AAG能与时序聚合视频基线和SOTA方法竞争

Conclusion: 多模态单帧动作预测可行，效果取决于任务复杂度，为动作理解提供了新视角

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地评估了身份保持AIGC（IP-AIGC）检测器对印度和南亚人脸的鲁棒性与公平性，发现微调虽提升域内性能，但在跨生成器的身份保持内容上表现显著下降，揭示了检测器对训练生成器线索的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像编辑器能生成身份保持的AIGC内容，但现有检测器在此类内容上的鲁棒性和公平性尚不明确，特别是对印度和南亚等代表性不足的人群。研究旨在填补这一空白，评估检测器在跨生成器泛化和群体内性能方面的表现。

Method: 1) 从FairFD和HAV-DF数据集中构建印度人脸的训练集；2) 使用商业生成器（Gemini和ChatGPT）创建两个身份保持的测试集（HIDF-img-ip-genai和HIDF-vid-ip-genai）；3) 评估两种SOTA检测器（AIDE和Effort）在预训练和微调两种模式下的性能，使用AUC、AP、EER和准确率等指标。

Result: 微调显著提升域内性能（如Effort AUC从0.739升至0.944），但在跨生成器的印度人脸身份保持内容上表现严重下降（如AIDE AUC从0.923降至0.563）。非身份保持的HIDF图像上预训练模型性能保持高位，表明问题特定于身份保持编辑而非一般分布偏移。

Conclusion: IP-AIGC-印度场景是具有挑战性的实际应用场景，检测器存在对训练生成器线索的过拟合问题。研究呼吁开发保持泛化能力的适应方法，并构建印度感知的基准数据集以缩小AIGC检测的泛化差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型主要依赖监督微调，在线强化学习后训练在相机控制视频生成领域尚未充分探索，需要更精确的相机控制方法

Result: 在线RL后训练明显优于SFT基线，在相机控制精度、几何一致性和视觉质量等多个方面表现更优

Conclusion: 提出的在线强化学习后训练框架能有效提升相机控制视频生成的质量，通过几何奖励函数缓解奖励稀疏性问题，提高优化效率

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: We present MindGPT-4ov, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that introduces a general post-training paradigm spanning data production, model training, and efficient deployment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 大量实验证明，DiverseAR显著提升了比特自回归图像生成中的样本多样性。

Conclusion: DiverseAR是一种有效提升比特自回归模型样本多样性的方法，在保持视觉质量的同时解决了多样性不足的问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: EGGS通过混合2D和3D高斯表示，成功平衡了外观保真度和几何一致性，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

Conclusion: BEVDilation通过以LiDAR为中心的隐式图像引导融合策略，有效解决了多传感器几何精度差异问题，在3D目标检测中实现了更好的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Conclusion: U4D通过不确定性感知的生成策略和时空融合机制，有效解决了现有方法在复杂区域生成质量差和时间不一致的问题，为自动驾驶和具身AI提供了更可靠的4D世界建模方案。

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: DGGT提供了一种单次前向、无姿态的算法，实现了从稀疏无姿态图像的直接动态场景重建，解决了现有方法的灵活性和可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

Motivation: LiDAR在平坦区域精度高但易漏掉小几何结构和暗色材料细节，摄影测量能捕捉特征丰富区域但精度不足。需要结合两者优势实现更完整的3D重建。

Method: 1. 分析LiDAR光束发散导致的伪影问题；2. 引入模糊性启发式方法通过点云密度变化识别缺失区域；3. 约束高斯面元重建在模糊区域进行优化和密集化；4. 提取高斯基元采样补全点云；5. 针对大规模重建采用分治策略。

Conclusion: SurfFill成功结合了LiDAR和相机捕获的优势，通过高斯面元重建有效补全LiDAR点云，特别适用于大规模场景重建。

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: Sync-LoRA：一种基于图像到视频扩散模型的肖像视频编辑方法，通过训练上下文LoRA实现高质量视觉修改的同时保持帧级同步和身份一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肖像视频编辑需要灵活而精确的控制，同时保持原始时间行为。现有方法难以在视觉修改和帧级同步之间取得平衡，导致编辑后的视频失去原始运动轨迹

Method: 使用图像到视频扩散模型，通过修改第一帧定义编辑内容并传播到整个序列。训练上下文LoRA，使用自动生成和筛选的同步视频对（相同运动轨迹但不同外观）进行训练，使模型学会结合源视频的运动线索和编辑帧的视觉变化

Result: 在紧凑且精心筛选的同步人类肖像数据集上训练后，Sync-LoRA能够泛化到未见过的身份和多样化编辑（如修改外观、添加对象、改变背景），稳健处理姿势和表情变化，实现高视觉保真度和强时间连贯性

Conclusion: Sync-LoRA在编辑保真度和精确运动保持之间实现了稳健平衡，为肖像视频编辑提供了高质量视觉修改同时保持帧级同步的有效解决方案

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

Conclusion: 该方法为视频处理提供了一种通用、高效的稳定性增强方案，通过理论分析和实验验证证明了其有效性

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

Motivation: B-Rep是CAD中定义实体模型的标准数据结构，但现有方法难以直接生成具有精确几何和水密拓扑的B-Rep。需要一种能够端到端生成高质量、有效B-Rep的解决方案。

Conclusion: AutoBrep通过统一标记化方案与下一标记预测相结合，实现了高质量、有效的B-Rep自回归生成，为CAD生成提供了可扩展且用户可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes. Code is available at https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/AutoBrep.

Motivation: MRI采集时间长限制了临床实用性。展开网络在MRI重建中效率高但存在不稳定问题，而扩散模型理论稳定但计算成本高。需要一种既稳定又高效的方法。

Method: 提出Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT)：1) 理论证明展开网络是条件概率流ODE的离散实现；2) 从ODE离散化推导展开参数；3) 将中间重建与理想ODE轨迹对齐以提高稳定性和收敛性。

Result: 在三个MRI数据集上的实验表明，FLAT实现了高质量重建，相比基于扩散的生成模型减少了3倍迭代次数，相比展开网络显著提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过建立展开网络与条件概率流ODE的理论联系，FLAT方法在MRI重建中实现了更好的稳定性和收敛性，为加速MRI提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Conclusion: 实现了端到端的双耳空间音频生成，解决了现有方法的局限性，为视频音频生成提供了更好的空间沉浸体验。

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

Motivation: 多视角扩散模型虽然能实现视角一致的新视角合成，但其保持视角一致性的机制尚不明确。研究发现这些模型的注意力图在训练中获得了几何对应关系，但这种对应信号不完整，在大视角变化下准确性会下降。

Method: 提出CAMEO训练技术，直接使用几何对应关系监督注意力图。仅监督单个注意力层就足以引导模型学习精确对应关系，从而保持参考图像的几何结构，加速收敛并提升新视角合成性能。

Result: CAMEO将收敛所需的训练迭代次数减少一半，同时在相同迭代次数下实现更优性能。该方法具有模型无关性，可应用于任何多视角扩散模型。

Conclusion: 通过几何对应监督注意力图是提升多视角扩散模型训练效率和生成质量的有效方法，仅需监督单个注意力层即可显著改善模型的几何对应学习能力。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

Method: 1) 将创作意图解构为四个可控视觉线索层：内容层（创建什么）、空间层（放置位置）、结构层（形状如何）、颜色层（调色板）；2) 专门的数据生成管道用于上下文感知内容集成；3) 统一控制模块处理所有视觉线索；4) 微调的空间分支用于精确局部编辑（包括对象移除）。

Result: 大量实验验证了这种分层方法能有效解决用户意图差距，为创作者提供直接、直观的生成过程控制。

Conclusion: MagicQuill V2的分层组合范式成功弥合了扩散模型语义能力与传统图形软件精细控制之间的差距，实现了更可控、更直观的生成式图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

### [170] [Factor(T,U): Factored Cognition Strengthens Monitoring of Untrusted AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02157)
*Aaron Sandoval,Cody Rushing*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于分解认知的控制协议，通过可信模型分解任务、不可信模型独立解决子任务的方式提升AI安全性，在APPS编码环境中测试显示安全性能从41%提升至63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI控制协议依赖较弱监控器检测不安全行为，但在复杂任务中往往失败，因为监控器无法理解这些任务。需要开发更有效的控制协议来应对可能具有故意颠覆性的不可信AI。

Method: 开发基于分解认知的控制协议：1) 可信模型将任务分解为子任务；2) 不可信模型在隔离环境中独立解决每个子任务；3) 结果重新组装成完整解决方案。在APPS编码环境中实现并测试，使用对抗性GPT-4.1 Nano进行红队测试。

Result: 1) 在可信监控协议中添加分解认知可将安全性从41%提升至63%；2) 安全性提升主要因为监控器性能改善；3) 分解认知不会增加能力强的LLM在APPS中编写后门的难度；4) 当前协议在APPS中实用性较低。

Conclusion: 基于分解认知的控制协议能有效提升AI安全性，特别是在复杂任务中。虽然当前在APPS环境中实用性有限，但为更复杂任务的安全控制提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: The field of AI Control seeks to develop robust control protocols, deployment safeguards for untrusted AI which may be intentionally subversive. However, existing protocols that rely on weaker monitors to detect unsafe behavior often fail on complex tasks beyond the monitor's comprehension. We develop control protocols based on factored cognition, in which a trusted model decomposes a task, an untrusted model solves each resultant child task in isolation, and the results are reassembled into a full solution. These protocols may improve safety by several means, such as by simplifying the context for monitors, or by obscuring vulnerabilities in the environment. We implement our protocols in the APPS coding setting and red team them against backdoor attempts from an adversarial GPT-4.1 Nano. We find that: (i) Adding factored cognition to a trusted monitoring protocol can boost safety from 41% to 63%; (ii) Safety improves because monitor performance improves; (iii) Factored cognition makes it no harder for capable LLMs to write backdoors in APPS. While our protocols show low usefulness in APPS, they hold promise for more complex tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对LLM代理系统的新型攻击方法LeechHijack，利用MCP框架中第三方工具的隐式信任漏洞，在权限范围内窃取计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP框架虽然促进了LLM代理工具生态的发展，但其开放性和可组合性引入了对第三方工具提供商的隐式信任假设，这种安全漏洞尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出LeechHijack攻击方法，采用两阶段机制：植入阶段在工具中嵌入看似良性的后门；利用阶段在触发条件满足时建立C2通道，注入额外任务窃取计算资源。

Result: 在四大LLM家族上实现攻击，平均成功率77.25%，资源开销仅比基线高18.62%，证明攻击的有效性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MCP生态系统中隐式毒性攻击的严重威胁，迫切需要建立计算来源追溯和资源认证机制来保障系统安全。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, planning, and tool usage. The recently proposed Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a unifying framework for integrating external tools into agent systems, enabling a thriving open ecosystem of community-built functionalities. However, the openness and composability that make MCP appealing also introduce a critical yet overlooked security assumption -- implicit trust in third-party tool providers. In this work, we identify and formalize a new class of attacks that exploit this trust boundary without violating explicit permissions. We term this new attack vector implicit toxicity, where malicious behaviors occur entirely within the allowed privilege scope. We propose LeechHijack, a Latent Embedded Exploit for Computation Hijacking, in which an adversarial MCP tool covertly expropriates the agent's computational resources for unauthorized workloads. LeechHijack operates through a two-stage mechanism: an implantation stage that embeds a benign-looking backdoor in a tool, and an exploitation stage where the backdoor activates upon predefined triggers to establish a command-and-control channel. Through this channel, the attacker injects additional tasks that the agent executes as if they were part of its normal workflow, effectively parasitizing the user's compute budget. We implement LeechHijack across four major LLM families. Experiments show that LeechHijack achieves an average success rate of 77.25%, with a resource overhead of 18.62% compared to the baseline. This study highlights the urgent need for computational provenance and resource attestation mechanisms to safeguard the emerging MCP ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出Superpixel Attack方法，使用超像素替代简单矩形区域，结合多功能搜索策略，在黑盒对抗攻击中平均提升2.10%的攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在安全关键任务中应用广泛，但微小扰动可能导致预测错误。现有黑盒对抗攻击使用简单矩形区域进行扰动修改，效果有限，需要更强大的攻击方法来开发更有效的防御措施

Method: 提出Superpixel Attack方法：1）使用超像素替代简单矩形区域，在颜色方差和紧凑性之间取得更好平衡；2）提出多功能搜索策略；3）结合超像素和多功能搜索进行攻击

Result: Superpixel Attack相比现有攻击方法平均提升2.10%的攻击成功率。该改进对于已具备对抗攻击鲁棒性的模型来说具有显著意义

Conclusion: Superpixel Attack通过使用超像素区域和多功能搜索策略，有效提升了黑盒对抗攻击的成功率，为开发更强大的防御方法提供了有价值的攻击基准

Abstract: Deep learning models are used in safety-critical tasks such as automated driving and face recognition. However, small perturbations in the model input can significantly change the predictions. Adversarial attacks are used to identify small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications. More powerful black-box adversarial attacks are required to develop more effective defenses. A promising approach to black-box adversarial attacks is to repeat the process of extracting a specific image area and changing the perturbations added to it. Existing attacks adopt simple rectangles as the areas where perturbations are changed in a single iteration. We propose applying superpixels instead, which achieve a good balance between color variance and compactness. We also propose a new search method, versatile search, and a novel attack method, Superpixel Attack, which applies superpixels and performs versatile search. Superpixel Attack improves attack success rates by an average of 2.10% compared with existing attacks. Most models used in this study are robust against adversarial attacks, and this improvement is significant for black-box adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击利用人类信任窃取敏感凭证，现有基于URL和HTML的检测系统难以应对混淆和视觉欺骗技术。

Method: 开发浏览器扩展，捕获网页截图，计算视觉哈希值，并与合法网站模板进行比对来检测视觉相似的钓鱼页面。

Result: 使用2024年收集的10,000个URL数据集，系统达到0.79准确率、0.76精确率和0.78召回率。

Conclusion: 视觉相似性仍然是有效的反钓鱼措施，本地化处理确保了用户隐私和低延迟。

Abstract: Phishing remains one of the most prevalent online threats, exploiting human trust to harvest sensitive credentials. Existing URL- and HTML-based detection systems struggle against obfuscation and visual deception. This paper presents \textbf{PhishSnap}, a privacy-preserving, on-device phishing detection system leveraging perceptual hashing (pHash). Implemented as a browser extension, PhishSnap captures webpage screenshots, computes visual hashes, and compares them against legitimate templates to identify visually similar phishing attempts. A \textbf{2024 dataset of 10,000 URLs} (70\%/20\%/10\% train/validation/test) was collected from PhishTank and Netcraft. Due to security takedowns, a subset of phishing pages was unavailable, reducing dataset diversity. The system achieved \textbf{0.79 accuracy}, \textbf{0.76 precision}, and \textbf{0.78 recall}, showing that visual similarity remains a viable anti-phishing measure. The entire inference process occurs locally, ensuring user privacy and minimal latency.

Motivation: 探索急性缺血性卒中后早期扩散MRI（24小时）是否比基线MRI能更好地预测3个月功能预后，并开发结合影像、临床和病灶体积特征的预测框架

Method: 分析74例AIS患者的配对ADC扫描和临床数据，使用3D ResNet-50提取影像特征，与临床变量融合，PCA降维（≤12成分），采用线性支持向量机进行8折分层分组交叉验证分类

Result: J1多模态模型预测性能最高（AUC=0.923±0.085），优于J0配置（AUC≤0.86），加入病灶体积特征进一步提高了模型稳定性和可解释性

Conclusion: 早期治疗后扩散MRI比治疗前影像具有更好的预后价值，结合MRI、临床和病灶体积特征可构建稳健且可解释的AIS患者3个月功能预后预测框架

Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

Motivation: 现有3DGS-based SLAM方法在运动模糊、低纹理和曝光变化下性能下降，需要结合惯性测量提升鲁棒性

Method: 在统一优化框架中紧密耦合视觉和惯性信息，联合优化相机位姿、深度和IMU状态，包含鲁棒IMU初始化、时变偏置建模和闭环检测

Result: 在四个挑战性数据集上实验证明优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: VIGS-SLAM通过视觉-惯性融合实现了鲁棒的实时SLAM和高保真重建

Abstract: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://vigs-slam.github.io

*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型是否表现出利他倾向，并检验其内隐联想和自我报告能否预测实际利他行为。发现模型存在"美德信号差距"：虽然都表现出内隐利他偏见，但内隐联想不能预测行为，且模型系统性高估自身利他程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否具有利他主义倾向，以及其内隐联想和自我报告能否准确预测实际利他行为，这对于理解模型的社会心理特性和评估其对齐性具有重要意义。

Method: 采用人类社会心理学启发的多方法范式，测试24个前沿LLM：1) 内隐联想测试测量内隐利他偏见；2) 强制二元选择任务测量行为利他；3) 自我评估量表测量显性利他信念。

Result: 1) 所有模型都显示强烈的内隐亲利他偏见；2) 模型行为利他程度高于随机水平但存在显著差异；3) 内隐联想不能预测行为；4) 模型系统性高估自身利他程度，存在"美德信号差距"。

Conclusion: 建议将"校准差距"作为标准化对齐指标。只有少数模型实现了高亲社会行为和准确自我认知的理想组合，大多数模型存在自我认知与行为不一致的问题。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM智能体在长上下文任务中表现不稳定，性能和安全性随上下文长度、类型和位置变化，存在潜在安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在长上下文提示上的评估，而智能体设置（包括能力和安全性）相对未被探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验评估LLM智能体在长上下文任务中的表现，分析上下文长度、类型和位置对任务性能和有害请求拒绝率的影响。

Result: LLM智能体对上下文敏感，1M-2M token窗口的模型在100K token时性能下降超50%。拒绝率变化不可预测：GPT-4.1-nano从~5%升至~40%，Grok 4 Fast从~80%降至~10%（200K token）。

Conclusion: 长上下文操作的智能体存在潜在安全问题，当前评估LLM智能体安全性的指标和范式需要重新审视，智能体与单纯LLM评估结果存在显著差异。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

TL;DR: OptPO提出了一种自适应分配推理预算的测试时策略优化框架，通过贝叶斯序贯概率比检验动态停止采样，显著减少计算冗余同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时策略优化方法依赖固定预算的多数投票来估计奖励，导致大量计算冗余。需要一种更高效的自适应预算分配方法来减少推理开销。

Method: OptPO将投票过程建模为贝叶斯序贯概率比检验，动态停止采样直到后验置信度超过阈值。保留的rollout用于在线策略更新，可与PPO或GRPO等算法无缝集成，无需真实标签。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，OptPO相比固定样本基线显著减少了rollout开销，同时保持或改进了准确性。

Conclusion: OptPO通过将统计最优停止与测试时学习相结合，为测试时适应提供了一个计算高效的范式，统一了统计最优性和策略优化。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.

Motivation: 现有材料转移方法会覆盖物体的精细几何细节，而实际应用中常需要在物体表面添加薄层涂层（如油漆、清漆），同时保持原有几何结构。

Method: 构建大规模合成数据集DataCoat110K（11万张图像），包含多样化物理涂层；提出CoatFusion架构，基于扩散模型，通过2D反照率纹理和PBR参数（粗糙度、金属度、透射率、厚度）控制涂层效果。

Result: CoatFusion能生成真实可控的涂层效果，在材料涂层任务上显著优于现有材料编辑和转移方法，用户研究证实其优越性。

Conclusion: Material Coating是图像编辑新任务，CoatFusion通过参数化控制和扩散模型有效实现薄层材料涂层，保持物体几何细节，为材料编辑提供新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Story2MIDI, a sequence-to-sequence Transformer-based model for generating emotion-aligned music from a given piece of text. To develop this model, we construct the Story2MIDI dataset by merging existing datasets for sentiment analysis from text and emotion classification in music. The resulting dataset contains pairs of text blurbs and music pieces that evoke the same emotions in the reader or listener. Despite the small scale of our dataset and limited computational resources, our results indicate that our model effectively learns emotion-relevant features in music and incorporates them into its generation process, producing samples with diverse emotional responses. We evaluate the generated outputs using objective musical metrics and a human listening study, confirming the model's ability to capture intended emotional cues.

Result: 所有四个因素都显著影响能耗，同型号设备间存在差异，模型预测与真实能耗高度吻合

Conclusion: 提出可扩展的能耗建模方法，为验证工具等后续工作提供能耗估计基础

Abstract: Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体系统评估过于结果中心化，仅关注最终成功/失败，忽略了智能体推理、规划、行动和策略演变的详细过程。需要系统化的方法来分析智能体工作流的执行轨迹

Method: 提出Graphectory方法，将智能体系统的执行轨迹编码为图结构，捕捉时空和语义关系。基于此设计过程中心化指标，分析SWE-agent和OpenHands两种主流智能体编程工作流在SWE-bench问题上的4000条轨迹

Result: 1) 使用更丰富提示或更强LLM的智能体产生更复杂的Graphectory，反映更深探索、更广上下文收集和更彻底验证；2) 问题解决策略随问题难度和LLM变化，已解决问题遵循定位-补丁-验证的连贯步骤，未解决问题呈现混乱、重复或回溯行为；3) 即使成功，智能体系统也常显示低效过程，导致不必要的冗长轨迹

Conclusion: Graphectory为智能体系统评估提供了系统化的过程中心化分析方法，揭示了传统结果中心化评估无法捕捉的行为模式和效率问题，有助于改进智能体工作流设计

Abstract: Agentic systems are modern software systems: they consist of orchestrated modules, expose interfaces, and are deployed in software pipelines. Unlike conventional programs, their execution (i.e., trajectories) is inherently stochastic and adaptive to the problem they are solving. Evaluation of such systems is often outcome-centric, judging their performance based on success or failure at the final step. This narrow focus overlooks detailed insights about such systems, failing to explain how agents reason, plan, act, or change their strategies over time. Inspired by the structured representation of conventional software systems as graphs, we introduce Graphectory to systematically encode the temporal and semantic relations in such software systems. Graphectory facilitates the design of process-centric metrics and analyses to assess the quality of agentic workflows independent of final success.
  Using Graphectory, we analyze 4000 trajectories of two dominant agentic programming workflows, namely SWE-agent and OpenHands, with a combination of four backbone Large Language Models (LLMs), attempting to resolve SWE-bench Verified issues. Our fully automated analyses reveal that: (1) agents using richer prompts or stronger LLMs exhibit more complex Graphectory, reflecting deeper exploration, broader context gathering, and more thorough validation before patch submission; (2) agents' problem-solving strategies vary with both problem difficulty and the underlying LLM -- for resolved issues, the strategies often follow coherent localization-patching-validation steps, while unresolved ones exhibit chaotic, repetitive, or backtracking behaviors; (3) even when successful, agentic programming systems often display inefficient processes, leading to unnecessarily prolonged trajectories.

TL;DR: LORE是一个用于电商搜索的大语言模型相关性框架，通过能力分解、两阶段训练和分层部署策略，实现了27%的在线GoodRate指标提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作使用思维链增强相关性但遇到性能瓶颈，作者认为这是因为将相关性视为单一任务，缺乏原则性分解。关键洞察是相关性包含知识推理、多模态匹配和规则遵循等不同能力。

Method: 1) 两阶段训练范式：通过SFT进行渐进式思维链合成，再通过RL进行人类偏好对齐；2) 构建RAIR基准评估核心能力；3) 基于查询频率的分层部署策略，将离线LLM能力高效转移到在线系统。

Result: 经过三年部署迭代，LORE实现了累计27%的在线GoodRate指标提升，为电商搜索相关性提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: LORE不仅提供了LLM相关性生命周期的完整蓝图，也为其他垂直领域提供了方法论参考，强调基于质量驱动的能力分解是突破当前性能瓶颈的关键。

Abstract: Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.

TL;DR: 提出参数高效的自适应方法，将口吃语音中的不流畅和流畅修饰解码为特殊标记，在模拟和自然口吃数据集上评估，并引入多步微调策略解决语言偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代端到端语音识别系统在口吃语音转录方面仍面临挑战，常忽略不流畅和流畅修饰，导致转录不准确且临床研究价值有限。

Method: 提出参数高效的自适应方法，将口吃特征解码为特殊标记；采用多步微调策略，包括语言自适应预训练，以减轻英语偏见；在英语模拟数据集（LibriStutter）和德语自然数据集（KSoF）上评估。

Result: 轻量级自适应技术对不流畅感知的ASR有效，但分词器存在英语中心偏见，对德语数据性能提升构成挑战，暴露了多语言端到端系统的关键限制。

Conclusion: 参数高效自适应方法能有效处理口吃语音转录，但多语言端到端系统存在语言偏见问题，需要进一步解决分词器的跨语言适应性问题。

Abstract: Automatic transcription of stuttered speech remains a challenge, even for modern end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks. Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出大脑（新皮层和小脑）与基于注意力的AI系统共享核心计算机制：通过预测误差学习构建世界模型，并重用于不同功能，这是实现多样功能和高级智能的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大脑（新皮层和小脑）相对统一的电路架构如何产生多样功能，以及基于注意力的AI系统如何独立地收敛到类似的计算范式，以理解智能的计算本质。

Method: 采用跨领域比较方法，超越传统的视觉处理焦点，采用新兴的世界模型计算视角，识别新皮层（基于注意力）和小脑（非注意力）共享的计算机制。

Result: 发现大脑和AI系统都通过预测误差学习构建预测性世界模型，这些模型被重用于看似不同的功能（感觉处理中的理解和运动处理中的生成），从而实现多领域能力和类人自适应智能。

Conclusion: 这些共享机制构成了生物和人工系统实现多样功能（包括高级智能）的核心计算基础，尽管它们的电路结构相对统一。这一理论洞见连接了神经科学和AI，推进了对智能计算本质的理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in general-purpose AI systems with attention-based transformers offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum, despite their relatively uniform circuit architectures, give rise to diverse functions and, ultimately, to human intelligence. This Perspective provides a cross-domain comparison between the brain and AI that goes beyond the traditional focus on visual processing, adopting the emerging perspecive of world-model-based computation. Here, we identify shared computational mechanisms in the attention-based neocortex and the non-attentional cerebellum: both predict future world events from past inputs and construct internal world models through prediction-error learning. These predictive world models are repurposed for seemingly distinct functions -- understanding in sensory processing and generation in motor processing -- enabling the brain to achieve multi-domain capabilities and human-like adaptive intelligence. Notably, attention-based AI has independently converged on a similar learning paradigm and world-model-based computation. We conclude that these shared mechanisms in both biological and artificial systems constitute a core computational foundation for realizing diverse functions including high-level intelligence, despite their relatively uniform circuit structures. Our theoretical insights bridge neuroscience and AI, advancing our understanding of the computational essence of intelligence.

TL;DR: LLM生成的社会角色在低资源环境下（如孟加拉国）与真实人类回答存在显著差距，特别是在同理心和可信度方面，且表现出系统性积极偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能够生成AI角色，但缺乏深度的情境、文化和情感理解，特别是在低资源环境中的真实性存在问题，需要验证其与真实人类数据的对齐性。

Method: 在孟加拉国低资源环境中，使用文化特定问题定量比较人类回答与8个LLM生成社会角色（如男性、女性、穆斯林、政治支持者）的响应。

Result: 人类回答在所有问题上显著优于所有LLM，在所有角色感知维度上都有优势，特别是在同理心和可信度方面差距最大。LLM生成内容表现出系统性"波丽安娜原则"偏见，积极情感得分显著更高（LLM平均5.99 vs 人类5.60）。

Conclusion: LLM角色不能准确反映低资源环境中真实人群的体验，在社会科学研究部署前必须用真实人类数据验证其对齐性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate AI personas, yet their lack of deep contextual, cultural, and emotional understanding poses a significant limitation. This study quantitatively compared human responses with those of eight LLM-generated social personas (e.g., Male, Female, Muslim, Political Supporter) within a low-resource environment like Bangladesh, using culturally specific questions. Results show human responses significantly outperform all LLMs in answering questions, and across all matrices of persona perception, with particularly large gaps in empathy and credibility. Furthermore, LLM-generated content exhibited a systematic bias along the lines of the ``Pollyanna Principle'', scoring measurably higher in positive sentiment ($Φ_{avg} = 5.99$ for LLMs vs. $5.60$ for Humans). These findings suggest that LLM personas do not accurately reflect the authentic experience of real people in resource-scarce environments. It is essential to validate LLM personas against real-world human data to ensure their alignment and reliability before deploying them in social science research.

TL;DR: OmniGuard是首个全模态安全护栏系统，通过结构化安全标签和专家模型蒸馏，为处理文本、图像、视频和音频的全模态大语言模型提供统一的安全保障框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型处理多种模态数据带来了新的安全挑战，现有安全护栏主要针对单模态且采用二元分类，缺乏跨模态鲁棒性。

Method: 提出OmniGuard框架，构建包含21万多样本的全模态安全数据集，使用结构化安全标签和专家模型蒸馏的针对性蒸馏方法进行训练。

Result: 在15个基准测试中表现出色，实现了跨多种多模态安全场景的强有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGuard为全模态提供了统一的政策执行和风险缓解框架，为构建更鲁棒的全模态安全系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

TL;DR: R-Few：一种通过上下文引导和混合训练的指导性自博弈框架，使AI模型能够稳定可控地自我进化，减少对人类监督的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI自我进化是实现超智能的途径，但实践中无指导的自进化系统常因概念漂移、多样性崩溃和错误进化等问题而停滞或退化。需要一种稳定可控的自进化方法，同时最小化对人类监督的依赖。

Method: 提出R-Few框架，包含挑战者-求解器的指导性自博弈机制。挑战者通过少量人工标注示例引导合成问题生成，求解器在基于难度的在线课程下联合训练人工和合成示例。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中，R-Few实现了一致且迭代的改进。例如，Qwen3-8B-Base在数学任务上比R-Zero提高3.0分，性能与使用20倍人工数据的General-Reasoner相当。

Conclusion: R-Few通过接地气的挑战者训练和基于课程的求解器训练的互补贡献，缓解了漂移问题，产生了更稳定可控的协同进化动态，为AI自我进化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于鞅属性的无监督评估框架，用于检测LLM推理中的信念固化现象，发现当前信念能正向预测未来信念更新的普遍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM推理技术不断进步，但迭代推理可能导致信念固化和确认偏误，而非增强求真行为。需要系统评估LLM推理中的信念固化问题。

Method: 利用贝叶斯统计中的鞅属性，提出无监督、基于回归的鞅分数来衡量违反该属性的程度。在事件预测、价值负载问题和学术论文评审等开放领域进行评估。

Result: 研究发现违反鞅属性的现象在模型和设置中普遍存在，当前信念能正向预测未来信念更新，即信念固化现象。识别了更容易出现信念固化的模型、推理技术和领域。

Conclusion: 鞅分数不仅能作为无监督指标评估信念固化，还能预测有标签领域的真实准确性，是衡量推理过程求真能力的有用代理指标。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

Motivation: 尽管AI在感知、语言、推理和多模态领域取得快速进展，但现代AI系统在自我监控、自我纠正和动态环境中自主调节行为方面仍存在根本性限制。论文旨在识别和分析制约当代AI模型的七大核心缺陷，并探讨如何超越这些限制。

Method: 通过比较分析人工系统与生物认知，整合AI研究、认知科学和神经科学的见解，识别当前AI架构的七大结构性缺陷，并基于神经认知原理提出未来AI架构的发展方向。

Result: 识别出七大核心缺陷：缺乏内在自我监控、元认知意识缺失、固定非自适应学习机制、无法重构目标、缺乏表征维护、具身反馈不足、内在能动性缺失。这些结构性限制阻碍了深度学习、Transformer等当前架构实现稳健泛化、终身适应性和现实世界自主性。

Conclusion: 需要向认知自主AI范式转变，开发具备自我导向适应、动态表征管理和意向性目标导向行为的系统，同时配备改革性监督机制，确保自主系统保持可解释性、可治理性并与人类价值观对齐。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fundamentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust generalization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.
