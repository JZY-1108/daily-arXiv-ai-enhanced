Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedBench-IT是首个针对意大利医学大学入学考试的综合性基准测试，包含17,410道专家编写的选择题，涵盖六个学科和三个难度级别，用于评估大语言模型在意大利医学教育领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在教育领域的应用潜力日益增长，但针对非英语语言在专业领域的基准测试仍然稀缺，特别是意大利语医学教育领域缺乏标准化的评估工具。

Method: 从领先的备考材料出版商Edizioni Simone获取数据，构建包含17,410道选择题的数据集，涵盖生物学、化学、逻辑学、通用文化、数学和物理六个学科。评估包括专有LLM（GPT-4o、Claude系列）和资源高效的开源模型（<30B参数），并进行准确性、可重复性测试、排序偏差分析和推理提示评估。

Result: 模型表现达到88.86%的响应一致性（因学科而异），排序偏差影响最小，发现题目可读性与模型性能之间存在统计显著但较小的负相关关系。

Conclusion: MedBench-IT为意大利NLP社区、教育技术开发者和从业者提供了重要资源，为该关键领域的当前能力和标准化评估方法提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone,
a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410
expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology,
Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty
levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude
series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters)
focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian
NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into
current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical
domain.

### [3] [Toward Purpose-oriented Topic Model Evaluation enabled by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07142)
*Zhiyin Tan,Jennifer D'Souza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用大语言模型自动评估动态演化主题模型的框架，包含9个基于LLM的指标，覆盖主题质量的四个关键维度，相比传统指标能更好地发现语义缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型评估指标（如连贯性和多样性）只能捕捉狭窄的统计模式，无法解释实践中的语义失败，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于LLM的目的导向评估框架，包含9个指标评估四个维度：词汇有效性、主题内语义合理性、主题间结构合理性和文档-主题对齐合理性，通过对抗性和采样协议验证。

Result: LLM-based指标提供了可解释、稳健且任务相关的评估，发现了传统指标经常遗漏的关键弱点，如冗余和语义漂移。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发可扩展的细粒度评估工具，用于维护动态数据集中的主题相关性，所有代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting
this work are accessible at

*Amal Chebbi,Babajide Kolade*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EnergyGPT是基于LLaMA 3.1-8B模型针对能源领域专门开发的领域专用语言模型，通过监督微调在高质量能源文本语料上训练，在能源相关任务上表现优于基础模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在能源等专业领域效果有限，需要深度技术专业知识和精确领域知识

Method: 使用监督微调方法在精心策划的能源相关文本语料上微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，包括完整的数据收集、模型微调、基准设计和评估部署流程

Result: EnergyGPT在大多数能源相关语言理解和生成任务上表现优于基础模型，证明了训练策略能够在不依赖大规模基础设施的情况下提升领域相关性和性能

Conclusion: 通过领域专业化微调可以显著提升语言模型在特定专业领域的表现，为其他垂直领域的大模型应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various domains. However, their general-purpose nature often limits their
effectiveness in specialized fields such as energy, where deep technical
expertise and precise domain knowledge are essential. In this paper, we
introduce EnergyGPT, a domain-specialized language model tailored for the
energy sector, developed by fine-tuning LLaMA 3.1-8B model using Supervised
Fine-Tuning on a high-quality, curated corpus of energy-related texts. We
present a complete development pipeline, including data collection and
curation, model fine-tuning, benchmark design and LLM-judge choice, evaluation
and deployment. Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy
enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for
large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using
domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that
EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language
understanding and generation tasks.

### [5] [DischargeSim: A Simulation Benchmark for Educational Doctor-Patient Communication at Discharge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07188)
*Zonghai Yao,Michael Sun,Won Seok Jang,Sunjae Kwon,Soie Kwon,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DischargeSim是一个评估大语言模型在出院沟通中作为个性化教育者能力的新基准，通过模拟医患对话测试模型在六个临床主题的表现，发现模型能力存在显著差距且模型大小不总是带来更好效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准主要关注诊断推理，但忽视了出院后患者教育这一关键环节。出院沟通是从诊断转向教育的重要阶段，需要评估模型支持患者离院后护理的能力

Method: 创建DischargeSim基准，模拟出院后多轮医患对话，使用LLM驱动的医生代理与具有不同心理社会特征的患者代理互动，涵盖六个临床主题，从对话质量、个性化文档生成和患者理解三个维度进行评估

Result: 在18个大语言模型上的实验显示，出院教育能力存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异。模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果，在策略使用和内容优先级方面存在权衡

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估大语言模型在临床后访教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持，揭示了当前模型在出院沟通方面的局限性

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

### [6] [Rule-Based Moral Principles for Explaining Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07190)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于规则道德原则的框架来处理LLM生成文本中的不确定性，使用Prolog引擎编码道德规则，通过场景模拟评估规则覆盖率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在高风险场景中应用时，概率方法往往不透明且与透明度期望不符，需要更透明的道德推理方法来处理不确定性。

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学定义预防、尊重、责任等道德规则，在Prolog引擎中编码不确定性级别触发相应系统行为，并通过场景模拟进行基准测试。

Result: 在临床和法律领域的用例表明，道德推理可以提高信任度和可解释性，为自然语言生成提供了透明轻量化的替代方案。

Conclusion: 基于道德原则的规则框架为LLM不确定性处理提供了比概率模型更透明和负责任的解决方案，特别适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

### [7] [LLM Analysis of 150+ years of German Parliamentary Debates on Migration Reveals Shift from Post-War Solidarity to Anti-Solidarity in the Last Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07274)
*Aida Kostikova,Ole Pütz,Steffen Eger,Olga Sabelfeld,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动标注德国议会辩论中的（反）团结子类型，评估模型性能并分析二战后至今德国对移民的团结态度趋势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法耗时且样本有限，需要探索LLMs在复杂政治文本标注任务中的自动化潜力，以深入研究德国移民政策辩论中的团结态度变化

Method: 评估多种LLMs模型在标注德国议会辩论（反）团结子类型任务上的表现，包括模型大小、提示工程、微调效果、历史与现代数据对比分析，并与数千个人工标注参考进行对比

Result: LLMs在复杂政治文本标注任务中表现出色，数据揭示战后时期高度移民导向的团结态度，以及2015年以来德国议会中强烈的反团结趋势

Conclusion: LLMs为政治文本分析提供了巨大潜力，德国移民辩论在人口下降和劳动力短缺背景下呈现日益极化的特点，值得进一步研究

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

### [8] [Causal Attention with Lookahead Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07301)
*Zhuoqing Song,Peng Sun,Huizhuo Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的键值来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务中表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只编码前文信息，无法利用后续上下文信息来增强表示能力。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的键值（称为lookahead keys），使其能够整合相对位置之后的token信息，同时保持自回归性质。通过数学等价性实现并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同模型规模下都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE机制通过动态更新键值来有效利用后续上下文信息，显著提升了语言模型的性能，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

### [9] [Basis Vector Metric: A Method for Robust Open-Ended State Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07308)
*David Oprea,Sam Powers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BVM方法在图像状态分类中表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但有改进潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，并与多种现有指标进行比较

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过语言嵌入进行状态判断。第一实验比较BVM与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化等指标的名词状态分类能力；第二实验比较BVM与逻辑回归模型的形容词区分能力

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面未能超越逻辑回归模型

Conclusion: BVM在状态分类方面有效，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进方法

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

### [10] [Instance-level Performance Prediction for Long-form Generation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07309)
*Chi-Yang Hsu,Alexander Braylan,Yiheng Su,Omar Alonso,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的基准测试，用于长文本生成任务的实例级性能预测，能够通过少量样本预测多维度细粒度质量指标，并支持不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长文本生成任务中多维度质量评估的实例级性能预测问题，需要一个任务、模型和指标无关的通用基准来推动该领域发展。

Method: 采用黑盒模型输入输出，预测连续评估指标分数，不仅预测点估计值，还要求推断预测区间来量化不确定性。在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，使用多个LLM、基线方法和指标。

Result: 研究表明，仅使用16个训练样本就能有效预测长文本生成任务的评分，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作引入了一个新颖且实用的任务，提供了有价值的基准来推动进展，并提供了可供实际采用的基线方法。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

### [11] [Does This Look Familiar to You? Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311)
*Sihyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KAMIR是一种基于模型内部表示的数据选择方法，通过分析隐藏状态相似性来评估数据，无需提示工程即可应用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调中数据选择方法依赖提示工程、成本高且适用范围有限的问题。

Method: 通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据。

Result: 实验表明使用不太熟悉的数据进行训练能获得更好的泛化性能，且适用于机器阅读理解、摘要等多种任务。

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效且通用的数据选择方法，能够提升模型性能而不增加额外成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SAOBP框架，通过信念传播注入多跳关系来解决Transformer自注意力机制中的局部化问题，防止注意力熵崩溃并提升模型性能，特别在小型模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力机制存在局部化问题，注意力往往集中在有限token子集上，难以捕获长距离依赖关系，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出Self-Attention One-step Belief Propagation (SAOBP)框架，通过信念传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入Global Token Dependency (GTD)指标来量化和解释这些多跳连接的相对贡献。

Result: SAOBP能够防止深层网络中的注意力熵崩溃，自适应地将GTD维持在任务适当水平，从而支持模型性能提升，在小型模型中表现出竞争优势。

Conclusion: SAOBP框架有效解决了自注意力的局部化问题，特别适合资源受限场景下的推理质量改进，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaFuse是一个新颖的LLM后训练框架，通过混合专家架构和动态路由网络，使大语言模型能够根据不同情境自适应表达不同个性，显著提升社交情感智能而不牺牲通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达，需要开发更具人性化的AI系统。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和五大人格模型，采用混合专家架构结合个性适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化的特质表达。

Result: 实验结果显示PersonaFuse在多维度社交情感智能上显著优于基线模型，在心理健康咨询和客服等下游应用中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示其响应质量与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的大语言模型，标志着向更人性化AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

TL;DR: LLM智能体无法在100次响应内通过模式识别和交互反馈成功学习新语言Tinkatongue进行对话，但表现出类似人类语言学习的策略模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM智能体是否能够像人类一样通过模式识别和交互反馈来获得语言能力，这是人类语言习得的核心特征

Method: 提出新颖的实验框架，让LLM智能体与仅懂新构造语言Tinkatongue的机器人进行对话，评估其语言习得能力

Result: LLM智能体在100次响应内未能成功建立对话，但采用了与人类语言学习相似的策略

Conclusion: 研究结果为评估基准提供了新方向，并为设计能够更有效从交互反馈中学习的模型开辟了途径

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖大型或专有模型进行知识图谱推理，限制了可访问性和可扩展性。研究发现小语言模型在知识图谱问答中性能受限，主要因为其遍历和推理知识图谱的能力有限。

Method: 提出使用简单高效的探索模块来处理知识图谱遍历，替代语言模型自身的图谱遍历功能，从而增强小语言模型的知识图谱推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些轻量级模块有效提升了小语言模型在知识图谱问答任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

TL;DR: LongEmotion是一个专门为长上下文情感智能任务设计的基准测试，包含6类情感任务，平均输入长度8777个token，提出了RAG和CoEM方法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了长上下文场景下的情感智能评估，特别是在真实、实用的设置中，交互冗长、多样且通常嘈杂。

Method: 提出LongEmotion基准测试，包含情感分类、检测、问答、对话、摘要和表达6类任务；开发了两种方法：RAG（利用对话上下文和LLM本身作为检索源）和CoEM（将任务分解为5个阶段，结合检索增强和有限知识注入）。

Result: 实验结果表明RAG和CoEM方法在大多数长上下文任务中持续提升情感智能相关性能；在GPT系列模型上的对比案例研究显示了不同模型在情感智能方面的差异。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了LLMs在更实用和真实世界情感智能应用方面的发展，LongEmotion基准为长上下文情感智能评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional
Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks
tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially
under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse,
and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present
LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It
covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion
Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

Motivation: 在线社交媒体中的积极支持性沟通（糖果语音）能够促进文明交流，但此类语言的自动检测研究不足，限制了对其影响的系统性分析。

Method: 在46k条德语YouTube评论语料库中，使用GBERT、Qwen3 Embedding和XLM-RoBERTa等单语和多语语言模型进行糖果语音检测，特别关注跨度级别的检测方法。

Result: 多语XLM-RoBERTa-Large模型在GermEval 2025糖果语音检测共享任务中表现最优，二元阳性F1得分0.8906，分类跨度检测严格F1得分0.6307。

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 污名化语言导致医疗保健不平等，但目前缺乏普遍接受或标准化的词典来定义医疗保健中的污名化语言词汇、术语或短语。

Method: 进行系统文献检索识别现有污名化语言词典，然后进行对比分析：1）词典间的相似性和差异；2）基于已建立情感数据集的积极、消极或中性术语分布。

Result: 识别出四个词典，分析显示它们具有中等语义相似性，大多数污名化术语与临床医生描述感知负面行为的判断性表达相关，情感分析显示主要为负面分类术语，但不同词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了标准化词典的必要性，并突显了在临床文本中定义污名化语言的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

effects of data augmentation techniques in improving translation systems in
low-resource African languages. We focus on two data augmentation techniques:
sentence concatenation with back translation and switch-out, applying them
across six African languages. Our experiments show significant improvements in
machine translation performance, with a minimum increase of 25\% in BLEU score
across all six languages.We provide a comprehensive analysis and highlight the
potential of these techniques to improve machine translation systems for
low-resource languages, contributing to the development of more robust
translation systems for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Motivation: 当前科学领域实体识别任务中，LLM微调成本高昂，需要寻找性能与成本的最佳平衡点，减少标注开销的同时保持高性能。

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架ALLabel，使用三种不同的主动学习策略依次选择信息量最大的样本，构建真实检索语料库用于LLM的上下文学习。

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下 consistently 优于所有基线方法，仅标注5%-10%的数据就能达到全数据集标注的 comparable 性能。

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效解决了LLM实体识别中的高标注成本问题，通过智能样本选择实现了性能与成本的最佳权衡，具有很好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

Motivation: 现有操作系统代理主要针对理想化环境设计，而现实世界环境往往存在不可信条件，存在过度执行的风险。

Method: 提出查询驱动的人机-GUI交互框架，采用两阶段学习范式训练VeriOS-Agent，使其在正常条件下自主执行动作，在不可信场景下主动查询人类。

Result: 在不可信场景下，VeriOS-Agent相比最先进方法将平均步骤成功率提高了20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现。

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现了合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信赖操作系统代理的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Motivation: 在大语言模型快速发展的背景下，知识更新迅速，重新训练成本高昂。现有基于检索增强生成的知识编辑方法在处理简单知识时表现良好，但在多跳问答中存在编辑跳过问题，导致编辑失败。

Method: 提出IRAKE方法，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行迭代检索增强知识编辑，采用引导分解策略来解决粒度不匹配和自然语言表达多样性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRAKE有效缓解了由编辑跳过引起的编辑失败问题，在多跳问答的知识编辑任务上超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: IRAKE方法通过迭代检索和引导分解策略，成功解决了多跳问答中知识编辑的挑战，为大规模语言模型的知识更新提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床报告通常冗长且包含大量专业术语，这使得领域专家难以高效识别文档中的重要信息，影响了医患之间的有效沟通和共享决策。

Method: 采用迭代自提示技术(ISP)在大语言模型上，通过基于示例的少样本学习生成任务特定提示并进行优化，同时使用ROUGE和BERT-score等词汇和嵌入空间指标来指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份临床病例报告上的官方评估显示，使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法获得了ROUGE分数(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERT分数(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)，高BERT分数表明模型生成的摘要与参考摘要语义等价。

Conclusion: 视角感知ISP(PA-ISP)技术可用于临床报告摘要生成，支持更好的医患沟通，尽管词汇重叠度较低，但语义保持效果良好。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本会丢失多模态信息，而大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)受限于输入尺寸无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成(RAG)方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接。

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级VLM进行图遍历检索相关页面，结合语义和逻辑相关性。提供无需训练的部署方案和微调版本两种变体。

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上，相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线方法检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过逻辑感知的检索框架有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的逻辑连接缺失问题，显著提升了文档问答性能。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从无标注文本中发现高质量的关系抽取训练样本

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLM在关系抽取中的语义捕捉不全面和计算开销大的问题，为关系抽取提供了高效的训练数据自动提取方案

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，其流畅性带来了来源和问责制的安全风险。水印技术虽然可以嵌入可检测模式来缓解这些风险，但在医疗环境中的可靠性尚未经过测试。

Method: 提出了一个医疗重点评估工作流程，联合评估事实准确性和连贯性。使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS)复合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而不仅仅是连贯性。

Result: 评估显示当前水印方法显著损害医学事实准确性，熵偏移会降低医学实体表示的质量。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发领域感知的水印方法，以保护医疗内容的完整性，确保在医疗等敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as

and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

*Michele Joshua Maggini,Dhia Merzougui,Rabiraj Bandyopadhyay,Gaël Dias,Fabrice Maurel,Pablo Gamallo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究全面评估了大语言模型在检测虚假新闻、有害内容和政治偏见方面的性能，比较了微调与上下文学习策略，发现微调方法优于上下文学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息的传播日益严重，但缺乏对不同大语言模型、使用方法和语言在这些任务上的系统性能评估。

Method: 在10个数据集和5种语言上测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、思维链等），比较了不同模型的性能。

Result: 实验发现上下文学习通常表现不如微调方法，即使是较小的微调模型也能超越大型模型的上下文学习性能。

Conclusion: 微调在特定任务设置中比上下文学习更有效，即使是较小的模型经过微调后也能超越大型模型在上下文学习设置中的表现。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Motivation: 解决现有科学文献信息抽取数据集局限于特定章节的问题，由于领域复杂性和标注成本高，缺乏完整的全文本标注数据集。

Method: 构建包含60篇NLP领域完整论文的人工标注数据集，涵盖7,072个实体和1,826个关系，并进行对比实验验证数据集有效性。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在不同长度学术文本上的抽取能力存在差异，SciNLP在部分基线模型上实现显著性能提升，基于该数据集构建的NLP知识图谱平均节点度为3.2。

Conclusion: SciNLP填补了NLP领域全文本实体关系抽取数据集的空白，为构建细粒度知识图谱和增强下游应用提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.

TL;DR: 本文提出DK2R模型，通过整合结构化属性和非结构化评论知识，利用大语言模型提升多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1）忽视非结构化评论知识；2）未充分利用大语言模型。作者希望充分利用双知识（结构化属性和非结构化评论知识）结合LLMs来改进多模态任务导向对话系统的文本响应生成。

Method: 提出DK2R模型：1）从外部知识库提取结构化属性和非结构化评论知识；2）使用LLM评估每种知识类型的效用；3）通过专用推理分别总结意图导向的关键线索；4）将这些线索作为辅助信号增强基于LLM的文本响应生成。

Result: 在公共数据集上的大量实验验证了DK2R的优越性。

Conclusion: DK2R通过双知识增强的两阶段推理器有效解决了动态知识类型选择和意图-响应解耦的挑战，显著提升了多模态任务导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2)，一个用于英语-罗马尼亚语文学翻译的统一框架，包括数据集创建、微调和评估，并发布了12B参数的微调模型和合成平行数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开放模型在文学翻译中的挑战，为低资源语言（如罗马尼亚语）提供高质量文学数据集和高效翻译模型。

Method: 使用高性能LLM生成15k高质量罗马尼亚语参考译文，对12B参数模型进行两阶段微调：指令调优捕捉体裁特定叙事风格，适配器压缩实现高效部署。

Result: 微调模型在流畅性和准确性方面与顶级专有大型模型竞争，同时具有开放性、可访问性和显著的成本效益。

Conclusion: TF2提供了一个端到端、可复现的流程，支持成本效益翻译研究、跨语言叙事生成，以及在低资源环境中广泛采用开放模型处理文化重要文学内容。

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了大型语言模型(LLM)和人类标注者在提示词修改下的敏感性差异，发现两者都对某些类型的提示变化表现出脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM输出不稳定性是否与人类标注行为相似，探讨提示词脆弱性是LLM特有的问题还是反映了人类标注的固有方差。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLMs和人类标注者使用相同的指令修改，系统比较两者对提示词变化的敏感性。

Result: 人类和LLMs都对替代标签集和标签格式的替换表现出增加的脆弱性，但人类判断受拼写错误和反转标签顺序的影响小于LLMs。

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性并非LLM特有，人类标注者也存在类似敏感性，但LLMs对某些类型的提示变化更加敏感。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的LoRA微调方法结合数据平衡、模型集成和采样机制，能够有效处理中文性别偏见检测与缓解任务，为促进NLP公平性提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

Motivation: 父母越来越多使用LLM生成睡前故事，但其中存在的文化和性别刻板印象引发严重担忧，需要系统性分析这些偏见

Method: 创建Biased Tales综合数据集，分析偏见如何影响主角属性和故事元素，比较不同性别和文化背景主角的故事差异

Result: 女孩主角相比男孩主角，外貌相关属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事比西方儿童故事更强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了社会文化偏见在创意AI应用中的影响，为实现更公平和多样化的AI使用提供了重要见解

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

TL;DR: GENUINE是一个基于图结构的LLM不确定性估计框架，通过依赖解析树和分层图池化来改进不确定性量化，在NLP任务中比语义熵方法AUROC提升29%，校准误差降低15%以上。

Motivation: 现有方法忽略语义依赖关系，仅依赖词级概率度量，无法捕捉生成文本中的结构关系，需要更可靠的不确定性估计方法来提高LLM在高风险应用中的可靠性。

Method: 提出GENUINE框架，利用依赖解析树和分层图池化技术，结合监督学习来建模语义和结构关系，改进置信度评估。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的广泛实验表明，GENUINE比基于语义熵的方法AUROC提升高达29%，校准误差降低超过15%。

Conclusion: 基于图结构的不确定性建模方法有效，GENUINE框架显著提升了LLM不确定性估计的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，无法有效激活LLMs的并行推理能力。

Method: 提出Parallel-R1强化学习框架：1）先在简单任务上使用SFT训练并行思维基础能力；2）然后在困难问题上转向RL进行探索和泛化；采用渐进式课程学习解决冷启动问题。

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准测试中，相比直接在挑战性任务上用RL训练的序列思维模型，准确率提升8.4%。并行思维早期作为探索策略，后期用于多视角验证，在AIME25上相比基线提升42.9%。

Conclusion: Parallel-R1成功培养了LLMs的并行思维能力，验证了并行思维可作为训练中的探索支架，临时探索阶段能够解锁更高的性能上限，模型、数据和代码将开源。

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应具有鲁棒性的细胞形态基础表示，能够在无需微调的情况下有效泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集（如JUMP Cell Painting联盟数据），但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型仍是关键障碍。

Method: 提出CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文令牌设计，无需在新数据上重新训练即可实现有效的分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在批次整合和生物信号保留方面表现更佳；在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能，证明了对显著域和特征偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基于图像分析的基础模型的重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路结构元素检测中存在误检问题，当外观相似时会产生过度检测，需要多模态信息融合来提高检测精度

Method: 基于领域规则构建多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19层）提取特征图，并与音频表征融合处理两种缺陷类别（轨道断裂和表面缺陷）

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，学生t检验证实了平均准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，结合视觉和音频信息可以克服单模态方法的局限性

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解构建类已知子空间，利用特征重构误差进行OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理OOD检测方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。为了解决这个问题，需要开发不依赖训练数据的有效方法。

Method: ClaFR方法首先对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间，然后将原始数据特征映射到该子空间获得新表示，最后通过计算子空间内的特征重构误差来确定OOD分数。

Result: 该方法在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据，适用于数据隐私保护场景。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了训练数据不可访问的问题，在保持高性能的同时保护了数据隐私。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可将基础模型适配到新领域，即使只有1000张图像也能显著提升性能，无需标签且超参数少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域数据量小、SSL方法不适用、预训练模型缺乏重要信息的问题，使基础模型能够适应新的数据分布。

Method: 使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，引入与监督微调相同的超参数数量，适用于不同数据模态和骨干网络。

Result: 在仅使用1000张图像的情况下，显著提升了DINOv3等最先进模型的性能，且在不同数据模态和骨干网络中表现稳定。

Conclusion: DIET-CP是一种简单有效的持续预训练策略，能够稳定地将基础模型适配到新领域，即使在小数据集上也能取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法在面对对抗攻击时容易导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同模型层间的提示耦合

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出优异的泛化能力

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个商业关键任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实企业数据上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖选择题和合成数据，无法捕捉真实企业应用的复杂性，如社交媒体内容分析。需要建立更贴近企业实际需求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个商业关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法用于OCR输出比较，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM与专有基线的对比评估中，ViLD提供了首个基于行业实际的任务驱动能力评估，为企业部署提供可行见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功连接了学术研究与企业需求，为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的实际部署提供了可靠的评估标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [46] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著优于基线模型，并提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统传输，其中扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部信息作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行训练。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比异常X线检测（+0.041 AUROC），校准性提升25-37%，且在仅有10-20%标注数据时仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能有效减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏倚审计，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

TL;DR: 研究发现先进视觉语言模型在识别破碎、融合或部分遮挡的文字时表现显著下降，与人类对文字的弹性识别能力形成鲜明对比，揭示了模型在符号组合性方面的结构局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究先进视觉语言模型是否具备人类对文字的弹性识别能力，即在字符破碎、融合或部分遮挡时仍能正确识别文字的能力。

Method: 构建两个心理物理学启发的基准测试，涵盖中文象形文字和英文字母单词，通过拼接、重组和叠加字形来创建对模型"可见但不可读"但对人类仍可读的刺激材料。

Result: 尽管在清晰文本上表现强劲，但当代视觉语言模型在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生不相关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合性先验。

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁开发能够编码符号分割、组合和跨文字绑定的架构和训练策略，为教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全等领域的多模态系统部署指明了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的方法，通过时间融合策略生成k空间数据，用于动态心脏MRI重建，在低数据条件下表现出强大的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，高质量且多样化的k空间数据在实践中很少可用，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的稳健重建。传统方法在图像域使用像素级卷积进行特征学习，而本研究旨在直接在频域进行特征级学习以解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然的全局特征空间。在频域进行特征级建模，并整合跨时间帧的k空间数据，采用多种融合策略来指导和优化生成轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力，能够稳定且丰富地生成数据，即使在超低数据情况下也能有效工作。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在频域进行特征级建模的实用潜力，能够有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题，为心脏MRI重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 研究模型是否能够在语义和感知差异大的类别之间泛化属性知识，例如识别"有四条腿"这一属性同时适用于"狗"和"椅子"。

Method: 引入基于LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类别分区的训练-测试分割策略，逐步减少训练集和测试集之间的相关性。

Result: 结果显示随着训练和测试类别相关性降低，模型性能急剧下降，其中聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性之间提供了最佳权衡。

Conclusion: 当前模型表示存在局限性，对分割设计敏感，这些发现为属性推理的未来基准构建提供了新见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM生成3D模型几何和结构保真度的稳健方法，需要开发定量评估框架来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型等应用。

Method: 提出了一套全面的相似性和复杂性度量标准（体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度、拓扑复杂性），使用L形支架组件作为案例研究，系统比较四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树、基于代码的校正提示）下的LLM性能。

Result: 研究发现语义丰富度增加能提高生成保真度，代码级提示在所有度量标准上实现了完美重建。定量评估方法相比传统定性方法能显著加快向真实值的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论，适用于各种CAD应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然在新视角合成中表现出色，但其高内存消耗严重限制了在边缘设备上的应用。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存的关键瓶颈问题。

Method: 1. 用轻量级的任意方向球面高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示；2. 提出统一的软剪枝框架，将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为单一约束优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，MEGS²相比现有方法实现了50%的静态VRAM减少和40%的渲染VRAM减少，同时保持了相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过创新的内存优化策略成功解决了3DGS在边缘设备上的内存瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Motivation: 现有高斯性正则化方法存在局限性，需要一种统一框架来确保潜在空间样本严格符合标准高斯分布，以促进文本到图像模型中基于潜在空间优化的下游任务。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准高斯变量，结合空间域的矩正则化和频谱域的功率谱正则化，通过随机排列输入确保排列不变性，构建复合损失函数。

Result: 新正则化方法在生成建模中优于现有高斯性正则化，有效防止奖励黑客攻击并加速收敛，在美学质量和文本对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为高斯性正则化提供了理论基础，空间-频谱双域方法在计算效率和性能上都优于现有方法，在文本到图像模型的奖励对齐任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。研究发现大型多模态模型(LMMs)不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了革命性进展，但存在延续训练数据中有害社会偏见的风险。先前研究虽然发现了性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的LMMs生成刻板印象男性、女性和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 1) LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板印象职业中生成93.0%男性图像，女性刻板印象职业中仅22.5%男性图像；2) 模型存在强烈默认男性偏见，非刻板印象职业中68.3%生成男性；3) 不同模型偏见程度差异显著(46.7%-73.3%)，表现最佳的模型接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 研究提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调了标准化自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发问责制和公平性的必要性，高偏见并非不可避免而是设计选择的结果。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

### [56] [Faster VGGT with Block-Sparse Global Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07120)
*Chung-Shien Brian Wang,Christian Schmidt,Jens Piekenbrinck,Bastian Leibe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍加速且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析注意力矩阵，发现概率质量集中在少数与跨视图几何匹配对应的patch-patch交互上。

Method: 受结构化注意力和大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集的全局注意力操作。该方法无需重新训练主干网络，适用于VGGT和π³模型，并支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了相当的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的扩展性问题，为处理大规模图像集提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究边缘服务器上视觉惯性里程计(VIO)的位姿欺骗威胁，提出了一种无监督、无需标签的检测与恢复机制，通过在无攻击会话中学习运动时序规律来检测运行时偏差并恢复位姿一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，细微的位姿欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时规避启发式检查。需要解决这种安全威胁。

Method: 提出无监督、无需标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话中训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复过程以恢复位姿一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用真实卸载VIO环境进行评估，实验结果显示相比无防御基线，轨迹和位姿误差显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的位姿欺骗攻击，显著降低轨迹和位姿误差，提升系统安全性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

TL;DR: 人脸增强技术虽然能改善面部外观，但会扭曲生物特征，显著降低深度伪造检测器的准确率，最高攻击成功率可达75.12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否具有反取证功能。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的GAN增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对朴素、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 基础增强滤波器可显著降低检测准确率（ASR达64.63%），GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，凸显了开发更具弹性和自适应性的取证方法的必要性。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习需要大量人工标注数据，但在开放世界场景中，新类别可能随时出现。现有方法主要关注半监督学习，本文探索完全无监督的新类发现方法。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成向量嵌入，通过注意力机制估计聚类数量，并整合流形学习技术利用数据内在几何结构来优化嵌入表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet等数据集上，无论聚类数量是否已知，都实现了单模态聚类和新类发现的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的完全无监督方法在开放世界场景中有效发现了新类别，为无监督学习在新类发现任务中的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [60] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种新颖的双提示、双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本，用于精确的乳腺超声分割，在BLU数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量、定量分析和下游分类至关重要，但对于边缘模糊、对比度低的小病灶仍然困难。文本提示可以增加临床背景，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索往往会产生粗糙的边界响应。

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，包含全局路径（基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整体图像语义）和局部路径（U-Net强调精确边界），通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的文本提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动操作。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到平均Dice系数0.8765和IoU 0.8149，优于六个强基线。小病灶改善最明显，减少了漏检区域和虚假激活。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补作用。

Conclusion: 双提示、双分支多模态设计结合全局语义和局部精度，能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，并提高对小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺问题阻碍深度学习应用，需要有效的数据增强方法来提升分类性能

Method: 使用DPM进行数据增强，融合预训练ResNet-50的深度特征和U-Net分割肿瘤提取的手工非线性特征（如分形维度），采用XGBoost分类器

Result: 达到98.0%准确率和98.1%敏感度，DPM增强和非线性特征融合均被证明是关键且统计显著的组成部分

Conclusion: 验证了先进生成模型与可解释特征之间的协同作用，可创建高精度医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: RecA是一种资源高效的后训练方法，通过视觉理解编码器嵌入作为密集文本提示，无需标注即可提供丰富监督，显著提升多模态模型的生成和编辑性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，导致理解与生成能力不匹配

Method: 使用自监督重建损失，让模型基于自身的视觉理解嵌入重建输入图像，从而实现理解与生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也有明显改善

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于多种UMM架构，性能超越更大的开源模型

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机多光谱目标检测面临的三个挑战：低光照图像降低多模态融合互补性、局部小目标建模受冗余信息干扰、基于Transformer的方法计算复杂度高难以在无人机平台应用

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上表现优异，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键问题，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时提升了检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN在骨架动作识别中虽然有效，但在区分模糊动作时存在局限，拓扑和空间特征表示不足

Method: 使用高斯滤波细化骨架拓扑图，集成门控循环单元(GRU)到GCN框架中增强骨架点间信息传播

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试中显著提升动作识别性能，特别是对模糊样本效果明显

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法具有良好的泛化性，能有效解决骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分问题

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会削弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL方法，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。通过自上而下分解和自下而上组合，构建模态特定解析图，使用递归双向交叉注意力并进行GM纯化

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL和相应网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的视觉-语言交互和多层次特征融合，解决了遮挡场景下人体姿态估计的挑战，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Motivation: 传统3D资产创建需要大量人工和经验，现有方法主要关注几何建模而忽略材质合成，需要实现端到端的PBR就绪3D生成

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯溅射，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重光照网格

Result: 在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型上表现出优越性能，模块化设计支持灵活集成多个扩散先验，仅需69k多视角实例即可高效收敛

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质的建模，具有高效收敛和灵活扩展的优点

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心设置中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: 该工作通过GLEAM-C和GLEAM-X推进了地理定位的透明度和可扩展性，使模型能够更好地解释和匹配。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

*Pooya Khosravi,Kun Han,Anthony T. Wu,Arghavan Rezvani,Zexin Feng,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现从OCT到OCTA的层感知血管重建，显著提升视网膜血管细节的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜不同层次的血管差异，难以重建临床诊断所需的精细血管细节。

Method: 提出跨维度监督模块利用分层en-face投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管轮廓提取。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验证明XOCT显著改进en-face投影质量，对临床视网膜病理评估具有重要意义。

Conclusion: XOCT框架有望提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，促进眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

*Sai Siddhartha Chary Aylapuram,Veeraraju Elluru,Shivang Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘技术的偏置缓解方法，通过在训练后选择性地移除偏置样本或特征表示，显著改善视觉模型的公平性，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练数据中容易依赖虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术为事后模型校正提供了有前景的替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏置、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏置、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏置）上进行实证分析。

Result: 事后遗忘方法能显著减少子群差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性改善达94.86%，CIFAR-10上30.28%，CelebA上97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在放射影像分类中表现出色但解释性差，限制了临床接受度。需要开发能够透明归因决策到特定图像区域的自解释模型。

Method: 将图像分割成不重叠的补丁，独立分类每个补丁，然后聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可直观可视化每个补丁的诊断贡献。

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image
regions. MedicalPatchNet splits images into non-overlapping patches,
independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks
associated with shortcut learning, thus improving clinical trust. Our model is

Motivation: 矢量图形动画通常需要大量手动工作，现有方法在灵活性和动画质量方面存在局限，需要自动化解决方案来生成生动自然的矢量动画

Method: 使用分层隐式神经表示重建矢量图形以保持其固有特性，然后通过预训练文本到视频扩散模型的视频分数蒸馏采样优化神经表示，最后将矢量图形变形以匹配表示结果

Result: 实验验证了该方法在生成生动自然矢量图形动画方面的有效性，相比现有技术有显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了矢量图形与扩散模型之间的领域差距问题，能够自动生成高质量的矢量动画

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Motivation: 传统导航系统在室内环境中因缺乏精确定位数据而效果不佳，需要开发能够整合视觉和语言信息的导航方法来帮助视障人士提高独立性和可达性。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）方法在人工标注的室内导航数据集上微调BLIP-2模型，并提出改进的BERT F1评分指标来强调方向和序列变量。

Result: 应用LoRA后，模型在生成方向性指令方面显著改善，克服了原始BLIP-2模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 该视觉-语言驱动的室内导航方法有效提升了导航指令生成的准确性和实用性，为视障人士提供了更好的室内导航支持。

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually
impaired individuals in reaching a target location using images and natural
language guidance. Traditional navigation systems are ineffective indoors due
to the lack of precise location data. Our approach integrates vision and
language models to generate step-by-step navigational instructions, enhancing
accessibility and independence. We fine-tune the BLIP-2 model with Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on a manually annotated indoor navigation dataset. We propose
an evaluation metric that refines the BERT F1 score by emphasizing directional
and sequential variables, providing a more comprehensive measure of
navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

TL;DR: DiGS将符号距离场(SDF)学习嵌入3D高斯泼溅框架，通过几何引导的网格增长策略提升表面重建精度和完整性，同时保持高渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面表现出色，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 为每个高斯分配可学习的SDF值，设计几何引导的网格增长策略，在多尺度层次下自适应分布高斯到几何一致区域。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS一致提高了重建精度和完整性，同时保持高渲染保真度。

Conclusion: DiGS通过将SDF学习与3DGS结合，成功实现了更好的几何一致性和表面重建质量，为3D重建提供了统一且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过局部混合和logits优化来解决现有方法破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失的问题，在遥感图像数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在遥感应用中容易受到对抗攻击，现有混合策略要么全局混合要么直接交换图像区域，这会破坏全局语义特征并误导对抗样本优化，同时交叉熵损失导致梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出局部混合策略生成多样化但语义一致的输入，将目标攻击中的logit损失适应到非目标场景以缓解梯度消失，应用扰动平滑损失抑制高频噪声增强可转移性。

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在6个代理模型上优于12种最先进方法，在MTARSI上使用ResNet作为代理时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提升17.28%。

Conclusion: 所提出的局部混合和logits优化框架有效解决了现有对抗攻击方法的局限性，显著提升了对抗样本的可转移性和攻击成功率，为遥感应用中的模型安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注会引入投影模糊问题，且单视角下部分物体可见性使得准确3D框估计困难

Method: 提出MVAT框架，使用时序多视图聚合物体点云构建完整3D表示，采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，教师网络从单视角学习但目标来自时间聚合的静态物体，学生网络从单视角预测伪标签，并引入多视图2D投影损失确保一致性

Conclusion: MVAT证明了利用时序多视图信息可以有效解决弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊问题，为降低3D标注成本提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够有效泛化到新的空间控制任务，适用于不同的扩散模型架构（UNet和DiT）。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Conclusion: 领域特定的掩码图像建模对医学图像表示学习具有重要意义，为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale

directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，用于3D形状识别任务的可解释深度学习，特别是在牙科CBCT图像的三维磨牙Demirjian分期应用中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在需要信任和问责的高风险应用中的采用，特别是在3D形状识别任务中需要可解释的决策过程。

Method: 使用图注意力卷积和内在注意力机制，通过注意力rollout可视化解释决策过程。评估了局部平均曲率和质心距离节点特征，以及模型深度，发现包含指向全局CLS节点的有向边的模型产生更直观的注意力图。

Result: 局部平均曲率和质心距离的组合作为节点特征产生了0.76加权F1分数的轻微性能提升，并提供更全面的注意力可视化。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策。虽然演示在牙科数据上，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，促进透明且具有竞争力的深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Motivation: 时间图像取证领域需要系统性的综述，特别是要解决现有方法中可能存在的content bias问题，验证已知年龄痕迹的特性，并探讨神经网络方法在时间取证中的可靠性。

Method: 通过分析前人工作、重新实现必要方法、进行实验验证，包括验证传感器缺陷的生长速率和空间分布特性，研究神经网络在掌纹图像年代测定中的特征学习机制。

Result: 发现某些声称利用传感器缺陷的方法实际上利用了其他痕迹（很可能是内容偏差）；验证了传感器缺陷的主要特性；展示了神经网络容易被分散注意力而无法学习真正的年龄痕迹。

Conclusion: 时间图像取证需要更现实的取证设置，可解释AI方法对于验证技术可靠性至关重要，当前某些方法存在对内容偏差的过度依赖问题。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，非性别特征（如物体和背景）的微小扰动会显著影响偏见得分，表明现有评估方法可能反映的是模型对虚假特征而非真实性别偏见的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实世界图像的性别偏见评估基准存在虚假相关性（性别与非性别特征之间的关联），这可能导致性别偏见评估失真，需要系统研究虚假特征对偏见评估的影响。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，通过掩蔽物体、模糊背景等方式，量化这些扰动对各种视觉语言模型偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小扰动（如掩蔽10%物体或弱模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见得分，生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%，表明当前偏见评估更多反映模型对虚假特征的响应而非真实性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于创建无虚假特征的基准具有根本性挑战，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型存在三个主要问题：未充分利用患者元数据、缺乏临床诊断知识整合、在3D医学影像上效果有限且计算资源需求大

Method: 1) 将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2) 添加预测MMSE评分的辅助token提供额外监督；3) 对图像和文本模态进行轻量级提示调优

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个AD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，优于使用10,000张图像微调的现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的数据增强和监督机制，有效解决了医学视觉语言模型在3D医学影像应用中的局限性，为AD诊断提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法对大量标注数据的依赖以及缺乏可解释性的问题，特别是在神经退行性疾病诊断中。

Method: 自监督交叉编码器框架，通过对比学习约束静态表示捕获稳定解剖特征，通过输入梯度正则化指导动态表示反映时间变化，可微调用于下游分类任务。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现优越分类准确性，在OASIS数据集上展示强零样本泛化能力，在PPMI数据集上展示跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经退行性疾病诊断中的数据标注依赖和可解释性问题，具有优秀的泛化性能，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在潜在扩散模型中虽然能抵抗再生攻击，但由于频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法，通过强制Hermitian对称性保持频率完整性；引入中心感知嵌入策略确保裁剪攻击下的信息保留。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，检测准确率最高，同时保持优异的图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)。

Conclusion: SFW是平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的有效框架，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Motivation: 小运动目标检测在国防应用中至关重要，但现有方法依赖目标特定特征或运动线索，在复杂环境中缺乏鲁棒性。背景具有强低秩结构可作为检测的稳定先验

Method: 将任务重新表述为基于张量的低秩稀疏分解问题，提出TenRPCANet网络，使用tokenization策略通过自注意力机制隐式强制执行多阶张量低秩先验，并设计特征细化模块增强目标显著性

Result: 在两个高度不同且具有挑战性的任务上实现最先进性能：多帧红外小目标检测和空间目标检测

Conclusion: 该方法证明了其有效性和泛化能力，无需对目标特征做过多假设，通过建模低秩背景结构实现鲁棒的小目标检测

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 传统单应性、多网格单应性和薄板样条方法在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 1. 指数衰减自由形变网络(EDFFDNet)使用指数衰减基函数实现局部性；2. 自适应稀疏运动聚合器(ASMA)将密集交互转为稀疏交互；3. 渐进式相关度细化策略利用全局-局部相关模式进行粗到细运动估计

Conclusion: 该方法在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上超越先前深度学习方法

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered

across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到对抗样本攻击。标准的对抗训练虽然能增强鲁棒性，但未能显式处理类间特征重叠这一导致对抗脆弱性的重要因素。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中消除对抗样本和干净样本的类间依赖投影来主动减轻类间接近性。具体包括识别每个对抗样本的最邻近类间邻居，然后移除这些邻居上的投影以增强特征可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN等标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在鲁棒准确率和干净准确率方面都取得了显著成就，与领先的对抗训练技术具有竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式处理类间特征接近性对于增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性具有重要意义，理论分析表明所提出的logits校正降低了神经网络的Lipschitz常数和Rademacher复杂度，从而改善了泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，难以处理需要试错探索的困难视觉任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出over-turn masking策略防止强化学习中惩罚超轮次响应。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互训练的情况下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: Mini-o3通过深度多轮推理和多样化探索模式，有效解决了复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了大规模工具交互的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型在短片段感知任务上表现良好，但在需要复杂推理的长视频任务上性能下降。本文旨在利用现有的感知能力来解决更复杂的视频推理问题。

Method: 开发了一个大型语言模型代理，可以访问视频模块作为子代理或工具。代理根据每个模块调用的结果动态决定后续步骤，而不是遵循固定程序。还引入了批评器来区分成功和不成功的执行序列。

Conclusion: 结合代理和批评器的方法能够有效利用现有视频感知能力来处理复杂的视频推理任务，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时仅引入最小的编码和解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，为不同语义区域提供更准确的概率分布估计

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

TL;DR: 使用多模态深度学习模型（XSRD-net）结合3D颅内CTA影像和临床数据，早期预测中风复发风险，在复发检测和复发时间预测方面取得良好效果，发现心脏病和颈动脉状况与中风复发密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高达5-25%，复发死亡率达40%，迫切需要早期识别高风险患者以进行适当治疗规划。

Method: 收集2010-2024年患者的3D颅内CTA影像数据、心脏病史、年龄和性别，训练单模态和多模态深度学习网络，进行二元复发检测（Task 1）和复发自由生存时间预测分类（Task 2）。

Result: 表格数据在复发检测任务中AUC达0.84；多模态模型在复发时间预测中c-index达0.68，AUC为0.71；发现心脏病（表格数据）和颈动脉状况（影像数据）与复发风险密切相关。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习能有效预测中风复发风险，心脏病和颈动脉状况是关键预测因素，需要持续数据收集和模型优化来加强这一发现。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用对头发重建的需求日益增长，现有方法往往忽视发丝的连接性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段流水线：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细头发几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯片段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下优化和生长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能稳健处理各种发型，并在1小时内完成高效重建

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级别的头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、引入尺度正则化减少误报交集、提出新的致密化标准改善远距离区域密度分布

Result: 在真实数据集上实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量提升高达+0.56 dB PSNR

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大场景的实时渲染

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各向异性的低分辨率MR图像，无需高分辨率数据即可重建解剖细节，在超分辨率性能上达到或超越现有方法，并实现了10倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学MR成像中，高分辨率图像采集耗时且影响患者舒适度，通常需要平衡扫描时间和图像质量。传统方法需要放射科医生分别分析低分辨率扫描，既耗时又可能导致解读不准确。

Method: 开发了多视角神经网络，采用自监督训练方式，无需对应的高分辨率数据。引入稀疏坐标基损失函数，支持任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像集成。结合患者无关的离线阶段和患者特定的在线阶段。

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上评估，结果显示在不同上采样尺度下，超分辨率性能达到或超越了最先进的自监督SR方法。患者特定重建速度提升高达10倍，同时保持相似或更好的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了MR成像中分辨率与扫描时间的平衡问题，提供了一种高效、准确的多视角图像融合解决方案，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了处理效率。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯泼溅场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知精炼，实现了最先进的感知质量和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能够从多视角图像创建高度逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复因遮挡或场景编辑导致的缺失区域时仍面临挑战，常常导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致的问题。

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度基和对象基监督，确保修复的高斯点准确放置在3D空间中并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知精炼方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分。

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的NeRF基和3DGS基修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果表明该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影，并在挑战性视角下具有更好的一致性。

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知精炼，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复效果和显著的效率提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型与3D点云之间的表示不对齐问题，现有方法在输入阶段需要繁重的预对齐，输出阶段缺乏显式几何线索导致细粒度精度损失

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习目标语义和场景关系的对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合OcDR token和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理实现了鲁棒的3D理解，有效解决了表示不对齐问题

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法能有效定位和修正MLLM中的幻觉错误，为多模态模型的可靠性提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT

Motivation: 现有方法主要在整个查询图像和支持目标对象之间建立图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合

Method: 设计对象级相关网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级相关性，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文针对消费级硬件上目标检测器的性能瓶颈问题，提出了两阶段自适应推理算法，在RTX 4060笔记本上实现1.85倍加速，仅损失5.51% mAP精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现消费级硬件上目标检测器的性能瓶颈主要来自系统级而非计算限制，需要硬件感知的推理策略来最大化吞吐量

Method: 提出两阶段自适应推理算法：先使用快速低分辨率通道，仅在检测置信度低时升级到高分辨率模型通道，无需架构修改

Result: 在5000张COCO图像上，相比PyTorch Early-Exit基线获得1.85倍加速，mAP损失仅为5.51%

Conclusion: 通过从纯模型优化转向硬件感知推理策略，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了实用可复现的蓝图

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有最先进的动态场景3D重建算法在重建翻滚非合作空间目标方面的性能，使用Isaac Sim模拟环境生成物理精确的2D图像序列，并在静态场景中使用Neuralangelo展示了有前景的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非合作空间目标(RSO)的表征在在轨服务(OOS)和主动碎片清除(ADR)任务中至关重要，需要评估目标的几何和运动特性，但目前重建翻滚非合作目标面临挑战。

Method: 开发了使用Isaac Sim的模拟环境来生成在真实轨道光照条件下翻滚卫星的物理精确2D图像序列，并评估现有最先进的动态场景3D重建算法性能，特别在静态场景中使用Neuralangelo进行重建。

Result: 初步结果显示，在静态场景中使用Neuralangelo的重建质量很有前景，生成的3D网格与原始CAD模型非常匹配，误差和伪影最小，能够捕捉任务规划所需的关键精细细节。

Conclusion: 这为正在进行的动态场景重建评估提供了基准，表明现有算法在重建非合作空间目标方面具有潜力，特别是在静态场景中已经取得了良好的重建效果。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于引导扩散模型的解码器，能够生成与用户指定特征高度匹配的图像，从而分析深度神经网络的特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的特征提取过程具有黑盒特性，难以理解其内部特征编码机制。本文旨在通过生成与特定特征匹配的图像来揭示DNN特征空间中的编码属性。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中，通过最小化生成图像特征与用户指定特征之间的欧几里得距离来指导图像生成。

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器进行，生成的图像特征与用户指定特征高度相似，成功揭示了这些DNN特征空间的有价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，且能在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络的黑盒特性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个用于单次参考图像6D姿态估计的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐和文本引导域随机化技术，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，并成功应用于真实机器人抓取任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D姿态的挑战性问题，特别是在3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像存在域差距的情况下。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）粗到精对齐模块结合多视图特征匹配和渲染-比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，使合成数据能够有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的一次性6D姿态估计，验证了在现实世界操作中的实用性，为机器人处理长尾真实世界实例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种简单的正则化策略，通过将MLLM的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，来增强多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致模型在训练过程中丢弃细粒度视觉细节。

Method: 提出VIRAL方法，通过显式对齐MLLM内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型的表示，使模型既能保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节，又能补充来自VFMs的额外视觉知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLM训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了Kernel VICReg，一种将VICReg自监督学习目标核化到再生核希尔伯特空间的新框架，通过核化方差、不变性和协方差项实现非线性特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要在欧几里得空间操作，限制了捕捉非线性依赖和几何结构的能力，需要将SSL目标扩展到非线性空间。

Method: 将VICReg目标核化到RKHS空间，使用双中心核矩阵和希尔伯特-施密特范数，无需显式映射即可实现非线性特征学习。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10、STL-10、TinyImageNet和ImageNet100上均优于欧几里得VICReg，在非线性结构明显的数据集上改进尤其显著。

Conclusion: 核化SSL目标是连接经典核方法与现代表示学习的有前景方向，能避免表示坍塌并提升复杂或小规模数据任务的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
representation learning by optimizing geometric objectives--such as invariance
to augmentations, variance preservation, and feature decorrelation--without
requiring labels. However, most existing methods operate in Euclidean space,
limiting their ability to capture nonlinear dependencies and geometric
structures. In this work, we propose Kernel VICReg, a novel self-supervised
learning framework that lifts the VICReg objective into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). By kernelizing each term of the loss-variance,
invariance, and covariance--we obtain a general formulation that operates on
double-centered kernel matrices and Hilbert-Schmidt norms, enabling nonlinear
feature learning without explicit mappings.
  We demonstrate that Kernel VICReg not only avoids representational collapse
but also improves performance on tasks with complex or small-scale data.
Empirical evaluations across MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet100 show consistent gains over Euclidean VICReg, with particularly
strong improvements on datasets where nonlinear structures are prominent. UMAP
visualizations further confirm that kernel-based embeddings exhibit better
isometry and class separation. Our results suggest that kernelizing SSL
objectives is a promising direction for bridging classical kernel methods with
modern representation learning.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM与EEG解码结合的潜力，推动了脑机接口技术的发展，为运动障碍患者提供了更易获取和高效的文本生成解决方案

Abstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with
the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography
(EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a
lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that
combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to
incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically
lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance
close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current
methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of
10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective
transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and
functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential
of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and
improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations.
Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for
research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the
strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production
more accessible and efficient.

Conclusion: 自监督学习驱动的表征能够改进冰晶特征描述，从而更好地约束其在地球气候系统中的作用

Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due
to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning
(SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By
pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn
robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various
science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL
approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a
relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent
representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven
representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and
subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.

TL;DR: CARE框架通过实时安全监控、回滚机制和自省干预策略，在解码阶段实现安全对齐，在安全性和响应质量之间取得更好平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，确保解码时输出安全成为关键挑战，现有方法往往在安全性和质量之间做出严重权衡

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)实时安全监控的守卫模型；(2)带令牌缓冲区的回滚机制；(3)基于自省的干预策略，模型生成对先前输出的自我反思来指导后续解码

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率之间实现了优越的平衡，有害响应率低，对用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了解码时安全对齐的优越安全-质量权衡

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的方法来评估Transformer电路中功能子图的连贯行为，需要一种单次前向传播就能量化电路可信度的指标。

Method: 基于层析/上同调和因果涌现理论，结合局部Jacobian和激活计算归一化的层析不一致性，以及基于前向状态的高斯有效信息代理来构建EICS指标。

Result: 提出了EICS这一白盒、单次前向传播的评估方法，使评分无单位化，并提供了实际应用指导、计算开销分析和玩具验证。

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的连贯性和可信度提供了理论框架和实用工具，但实证验证仍需在LLM任务上进行。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Motivation: 密码破解任务具有组合复杂性（26!种可能映射），是研究神经网络在复杂组合领域泛化能力的理想测试平台，同时需要提高模型的可解释性。

Method: 开发ALICE架构：简单的编码器Transformer，使用Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法构建新颖的双射解码头来显式建模排列，支持直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在准确性和速度上都达到最先进水平，仅用约1500个密码样本（占可能密码空间的3.7×10^-24）就能泛化到未见密码。通过早期退出分析发现模型决策过程类似人类策略：早期层使用频率启发式，中间层形成单词结构，最终层修正单个字符。

Conclusion: ALICE的架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment

*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Alexandrovna Studenikina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCond是一种基于PCGrad原理的多任务学习梯度冲突解决方法，通过梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制实现计算效率提升，在保持优化质量的同时获得两倍速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务学习梯度冲突解决方法（如PCGrad、CAGrad、GradNorm）计算成本高昂，限制了它们在现代大型模型和Transformer中的应用。

Method: 结合PCGrad原理与梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，提出Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，包括随机模式和确定性模式。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈CT扫描数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，计算速度提升两倍，且具有良好的可扩展性和优化器兼容性。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于从紧凑模型到大型架构的各种场景。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

TL;DR: 提出结合EfficientNet深度学习模型和数字孪生系统的新框架，用于改进心脏骤停的早期检测和分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏骤停是全球重大健康问题，早期识别和管理对改善患者预后至关重要

Method: 使用EfficientNet深度学习模型学习心血管图像特征，同时通过IoT设备数据构建个体化数字孪生心血管系统模型

Result: 实验表明系统预测准确率高且效率良好

Conclusion: 深度学习与数字孪生技术结合为心脏病预测提供了主动个体化方法的新可能

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection
and analysis of cardiac arrest. We use compound scaling and EfficientNet to
learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Motivation: 解决智能家居中食品管理效率问题，特别是在高密度库存条件下物品重叠、遮挡导致的检测不准确问题，减少食物浪费并优化家庭消费

Method: 系统分为三个核心模块：数据预处理、目标检测与管理、基于Web的可视化。采用改进的focal loss变体，通过温度缩放实现自适应类别误差校准

Result: 鲁棒的功能校准显著提高了在不同光照条件和可扩展性挑战下的检测可靠性，减少了误计数和误分类

Conclusion: 该系统为现代食品管理提供了实用的用户导向解决方案，通过减少浪费和更明智的消费推进可持续生活目标

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless
connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management.
By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM
to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency
through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature
monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and
household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions,
capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as
overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and
counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups
reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or
misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules:
data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based
visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by
overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates
over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This
approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature
scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across
methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration
significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions
and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical,
user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living
goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.

*Anjiang Wei,Tianran Sun,Yogesh Seenichamy,Hang Song,Anne Ouyang,Azalia Mirhoseini,Ke Wang,Alex Aiken*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Astra是首个基于LLM的多智能体系统，专门用于GPU内核优化，通过多个专业LLM智能体协作，从现有CUDA实现出发进行迭代优化，在SGLang内核上实现了1.32倍的平均加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核优化对LLM训练和服务至关重要，但传统方法需要大量人工调优。虽然编译器系统减轻了部分负担，但仍需大量人工设计和工程努力。现有LLM方法主要关注将PyTorch模块转换为CUDA代码，而非优化现有CUDA实现。

Method: Astra采用多智能体LLM系统，从SGLang框架中提取现有CUDA实现作为起点。多个专业LLM智能体通过迭代的代码生成、测试、性能分析和规划进行协作，应用循环变换、优化内存访问模式、利用CUDA内置函数和快速数学运算等技术。

Result: 在SGLang内核上，Astra使用OpenAI o4-mini进行零样本提示，实现了平均1.32倍的加速。案例研究表明LLM能够自主应用各种优化技术获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统为GPU内核优化提供了一个有前景的新范式，能够有效减少人工调优需求，实现自动化的高性能内核生成。

Abstract: GPU kernel optimization has long been a central challenge at the intersection
of high-performance computing and machine learning. Efficient kernels are
crucial for accelerating large language model (LLM) training and serving, yet
attaining high performance typically requires extensive manual tuning.
Compiler-based systems reduce some of this burden, but still demand substantial
manual design and engineering effort. Recently, researchers have explored using
LLMs for GPU kernel generation, though prior work has largely focused on
translating high-level PyTorch modules into CUDA code. In this work, we
introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel
optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA
implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving
LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra,
specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing,
profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and
high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of
1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini. A detailed case study
further demonstrates that LLMs can autonomously apply loop transformations,
optimize memory access patterns, exploit CUDA intrinsics, and leverage fast
math operations to yield substantial performance gains. Our work highlights
multi-agent LLM systems as a promising new paradigm for GPU kernel
optimization.

Motivation: 超越基于偏好的对齐方法，确保LLM能够遵守包含伦理原则、操作安全协议和法规合规标准的复杂可配置规则集。

Method: 结合原则性自动奖励评分、群体相对策略优化(GRPO)和基于开放策略代理(OPA)的治理层，构建可治理的AI系统。

Result: 在基于Dharma伦理的医疗AI助手案例中，实现了70.9%的领域范围遵循度提升，展示了框架对文化特定价值系统的适应性。

Conclusion: ArGen为构建技术上精通、伦理上稳健且可验证合规的'可治理AI'系统提供了技术基础，适用于全球多样化部署场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全谱神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构在谱域进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合符号推理的可解释性和神经网络的扩展性，通过谱方法在知识图谱上实现高效推理，解决传统方法在可扩展性和鲁棒性方面的限制。

Method: 使用图信号处理和频率选择性滤波器，基于知识图谱的拉普拉斯特征结构进行谱嵌入，包含动态图学习、混合谱专家、证明引导训练等多种扩展技术。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中达到最先进准确率，推理速度更快，对抗扰动鲁棒性更强，模型决策与符号证明结构高度一致。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了可扩展、有原则的基础框架，在透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面超越传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要一种能够利用专家演示来解决这类任务的方法。

Method: 给定单个演示，代理提取逐步指令并严格按用户预期轨迹执行；使用验证器和回溯器模块提高鲁棒性，处理意外中断如弹窗。

Result: 在OSWorld任务集上达到60%的成功率，所有顶级代理此前均未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线、办公室或律师转介服务寻求法律帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权等），需要准确的法律问题分类来确保用户获得正确的法律帮助。

Method: 开发FETCH分类器，采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，并自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实世界查询的新数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律帮助资源的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力视为竞争游戏中的表现，让模型与自己对抗来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，仅通过自博弈就能提升指令跟随任务的性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习为语言模型提供了一条不依赖额外数据就能持续改进的有效途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

TL;DR: Falcon3-Audio是一个基于指令调优LLM和Whisper编码器的音频-语言模型家族，仅使用少量公开音频数据（<30K小时）就在MMAU基准上达到最佳开源模型性能，证明了卓越的数据和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频在人类交流中至关重要，但大语言模型与音频的整合仍未被充分探索，需要开发高效的音频-语言模型。

Method: 基于指令调优的大语言模型和Whisper编码器构建Falcon3-Audio模型家族，使用单阶段训练，仅需少量公开音频数据（<30K小时）。

Result: Falcon3-Audio-7B在MMAU基准上获得64.14分，匹配R1-AQA性能，最小的1B模型也能与2B-13B参数的开源模型竞争，且无需复杂的课程学习或多编码器设计。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使与使用50万小时数据训练的模型相比，简单的单阶段训练架构也能实现强大的音频-语言模型性能，挑战了现有复杂设计的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with
audio remains underexplored -- despite audio's centrality to human
communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models
(ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably
small amount of public audio data -- less than 30K hours (5K unique) --
Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models
on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while
distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency,
single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains
competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through
extensive ablations, we find that common complexities -- such as curriculum
learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors --
are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on
over 500K hours of data.

Abstract: The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing
highly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric
applications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio
conferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several
state-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been
proposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and
deepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely
undermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.
These AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical
modifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and
quantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \& W, and
DeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a
comparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake
signatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We
conducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark
datasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This
comparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and
limitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only
highlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more
robust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will
further guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that
can effectively counter evolving AF techniques.

Conclusion: 对于使用深度CNN的音频分类任务，梅尔频谱图和MFCC是最有效的特征选择

Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains
like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various
spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy
normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input
data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm
features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification
is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000
labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning
pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for
multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the
mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then

accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.
The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January

(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists
independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets
using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for
408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity
Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally
acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases
>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to
moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These
findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain
MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image
quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions
such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical
for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and
variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.
This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for
automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural
innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction
from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical
cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced
retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is
integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of
model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework
achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a
Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance
across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM
visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation
with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural
improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers
a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy
and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing
OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in
AI-driven ophthalmic tools.

### [137] [SVGauge: Towards Human-Aligned Evaluation for SVG Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07127)
*Leonardo Zini,Elia Frigieri,Sebastiano Aloscari,Marcello Generali,Lorenzo Dodi,Robert Dosen,Lorenzo Baraldi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SVGauge是第一个针对文本到SVG生成的人类对齐参考指标，通过联合测量视觉保真度和语义一致性来评估SVG图像质量，在SHE基准测试中显示出与人类判断的最高相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像评估指标（如FID、LPIPS、CLIPScore）无法满足SVG图像的符号和矢量特性评估需求，需要专门针对SVG的评估标准。

Method: SVGauge联合测量：(i)视觉保真度：通过提取SigLIP图像嵌入，使用PCA和白化进行域对齐；(ii)语义一致性：通过比较BLIP-2生成的SVG标题与原始提示在SBERT和TF-IDF组合空间中的相似度。

Result: 在SHE基准测试中，SVGauge获得了与人类判断的最高相关性，并比现有指标更忠实地再现了八个零样本LLM生成器的系统级排名。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了矢量特定评估的必要性，并为未来文本到SVG生成模型的基准测试提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generated Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images demand evaluation criteria
tuned to their symbolic and vectorial nature: criteria that existing metrics
such as FID, LPIPS, or CLIPScore fail to satisfy. In this paper, we introduce
SVGauge, the first human-aligned, reference based metric for text-to-SVG
generation. SVGauge jointly measures (i) visual fidelity, obtained by
extracting SigLIP image embeddings and refining them with PCA and whitening for
domain alignment, and (ii) semantic consistency, captured by comparing
BLIP-2-generated captions of the SVGs against the original prompts in the
combined space of SBERT and TF-IDF. Evaluation on the proposed SHE benchmark
shows that SVGauge attains the highest correlation with human judgments and
reproduces system-level rankings of eight zero-shot LLM-based generators more
faithfully than existing metrics. Our results highlight the necessity of
vector-specific evaluation and provide a practical tool for benchmarking future
text-to-SVG generation models.

*Jierui Ren,Haojie Jin,Bo Pang,Yisong Chen,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出神经锥辐射度方法，通过反射感知的射线锥编码来高效建模高频出射辐射分布，特别针对光滑材质的高频视角相关辐射分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经辐射度方法主要依赖位置特征编码，在捕捉高频、强视角相关的辐射分布方面存在明显局限性，特别是对于光滑材质的窄波瓣辐射分布。

Method: 基于神经辐射度框架，采用预滤波多分辨率哈希网格来精确近似光滑BSDF波瓣，通过连续空间聚合将视角相关反射特性直接嵌入编码过程。

Result: 方法显著提升了网络建模高频反射分布的能力，能有效处理从高光到低光等各种光泽度表面，同时保持网络结构紧凑高效，实时生成高质量无噪声渲染。

Conclusion: 相比基线方法，该方法在各种光泽度条件下都能实时产生高质量渲染，提供卓越的保真度和真实感，成功解决了高频视角相关辐射分布的建模难题。

Abstract: Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a
key challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such
distributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly
sensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity
methods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable
limitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance
distributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by
reflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,
named neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered
multi-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,
embedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding
process through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only
significantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection
distributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of
glossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our
method reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,
allowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently
produces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various
glossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to
baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DepthVision是一个多模态场景理解框架，通过GAN从稀疏LiDAR点云生成RGB图像，并结合真实RGB数据，在光照不足条件下提升机器人视觉性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人视觉输入退化或不足时的可靠性问题，特别是在黑暗、运动模糊等传感器退化情况下确保安全关键任务的执行。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络（GAN）从LiDAR点云合成RGB图像，通过Luminance-Aware Modality Adaptation（LAMA）动态融合合成图像和真实RGB数据，无需微调下游视觉语言模型。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上的评估显示，DepthVision在低光照条件下显著优于仅使用RGB的基线方法，同时保持与冻结VLMs的兼容性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了LiDAR引导的RGB合成在实现现实环境中鲁棒机器人操作方面的潜力，为传感器退化情况下的可靠视觉理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable robot operation when visual input is degraded or
insufficient remains a central challenge in robotics. This letter introduces
DepthVision, a framework for multimodal scene understanding designed to address
this problem. Unlike existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which use only
camera-based visual input alongside language, DepthVision synthesizes RGB
images from sparse LiDAR point clouds using a conditional generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an integrated refiner network. These synthetic
views are then combined with real RGB data using a Luminance-Aware Modality
Adaptation (LAMA), which blends the two types of data dynamically based on
ambient lighting conditions. This approach compensates for sensor degradation,
such as darkness or motion blur, without requiring any fine-tuning of
downstream vision-language models. We evaluate DepthVision on real and
simulated datasets across various models and tasks, with particular attention
to safety-critical tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach improves
performance in low-light conditions, achieving substantial gains over RGB-only
baselines while preserving compatibility with frozen VLMs. This work highlights
the potential of LiDAR-guided RGB synthesis for achieving robust robot
operation in real-world environments.

*Gavin Tao,Yinuo Wang,Jinzhao Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于SSD-Mamba2的视觉驱动跨模态强化学习框架，用于运动控制，相比传统方法具有更好的计算效率和性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端强化学习方法在运动控制中存在计算内存权衡不佳、长时程信用分配困难、Transformer二次计算成本高等问题

Method: 使用SSD-Mamba2选择性状态空间骨干网络，融合本体感知状态和外感观察，通过硬件感知流式处理和近线性缩放实现高效特征融合

Result: 在多样化运动控制场景中，该方法在回报率、安全性、样本效率等方面均超越现有最优基线，且在相同计算预算下收敛更快

Conclusion: SSD-Mamba2为可扩展、有前瞻性和高效的端到端运动控制提供了实用的融合骨干网络

Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified
perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most
deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion
backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers
struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion
incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.
We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a
selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable
both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and
near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations
(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked
SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range
dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic
self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable
training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula
that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene
complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy
efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach
consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety
(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the
same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical
fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion
control.

### [141] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 是一种新颖的检索方法，通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档，而非传统顺序重排序，在有限重排序预算下显著提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-重排序流水线存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索质量，以及LLM重排序器计算需求大限制了可处理文档数量。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，且重排序预算仅限100个文档。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序模型对下，策略性地选择重排序文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [142] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个复杂检索任务的多样化基准测试，评估了当前最先进的检索模型在复杂查询场景下的表现，发现即使是最好模型的表现也不理想，LLM增强对弱模型有帮助但对强模型反而降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索模型评估主要针对简单查询，缺乏对复杂检索任务（包含多个部分、约束或自然语言要求的查询）的全面评估资源，无法真实反映检索模型在复杂现实场景中的能力。

Method: 构建了一个多样化和现实的复杂检索任务集，对代表性的最先进检索模型进行基准测试，并探索了基于LLM的查询扩展和重写对检索质量的影响。

Result: 最佳模型的平均nDCG@10仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587。LLM增强可以帮助较弱模型，但对最强模型在所有重写技术下都会降低所有指标的性能。

Conclusion: 当前检索模型在处理复杂检索任务时表现不佳，需要开发新一代检索模型来应对复杂的现实世界检索需求，LLM增强技术需要更精细的设计以避免对强模型产生负面影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.
