Recent works show that when\ntrained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward\nmodels in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained\nweights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.\nCurrent self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training\nlargely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on\nraw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of\nevents. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training\nframework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is\nwell-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long\nevent sequences during pre-training.

Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to\nreason about long-term history of events.

Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.\nSpecifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG\nmodules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and\ngeneration agents.

During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range.

Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing\noverall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point\nimprovement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant\nperformance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding\nconventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish\nthe potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face\nrecognition applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6cd5\u533b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece29.1%\u63d0\u5347\u81f384.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cd5\u533b\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Flux.1 Kontext Dev\u7ba1\u9053\u548cFacezoom LoRA\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5bf97\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b3,000\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c24,000\u6b21\u8bc6\u522b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u534755.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0895% CI: [54.1, 56.7]\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cd5\u533b\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced\ncomputational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering\ndiverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen\ndatasets.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nEgocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks\nthat utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without\nrelying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional\nmotion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored\nfor egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports\negocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person\nvisual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene\nsemantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer\nplausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a\nlarge-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth\n3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in\negocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a\nsingle egocentric image.

Additional experiments and\nablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The\nproposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label\nscarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on\nseveral detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The\nproposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%\n(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)\nmethods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive\nperformance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,\nindicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size\nshowed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without\nevidence of overfitting or additional computational cost.

Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns.

It is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder\nframeworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that\nmodels trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially\nunder challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general\napplicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "TEACH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u8f93\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08STR\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u635f\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4ece\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTEACH\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "TEACH\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite its 96 million speaker\nbase worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine\nLearning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.\nThis work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment\nclassification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only\nprovides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with\nprovisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical\nrequirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts\ncovering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites\nand web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a\ncustom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol\nfor collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated\nrationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:\nwith rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed\nplausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,\nfor six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,\nwe curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate\nfairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a\nfairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models.

However,\nexisting PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)\nevaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,\nmaking it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later\nones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation\nparadigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly\nincorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the\nconventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier\nones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely\nthrough prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,\nwithout any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures\nBiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using\nsamples generated by three different policy models.

Current research shows that using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields\nexcellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled\nmulti-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions\nacross turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual\nconsistency maintenance for annotators (termed \\textbf{``Annotating\nDisaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in\nsequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn\npreference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn\nextraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework\nnamed \\textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes\nthe dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn\ndialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves\nannotation efficiency.

While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level\nannotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To\nreduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a\nnew task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only\nweak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.\nWSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual\nsimilarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and\ndegraded parsing performance.

This alignment process\nis bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers\nand a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In\nthe second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The\nwell-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label\ngenerator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back\nthe efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,\nunlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream\ndatasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by\nsignificant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even\nsurpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger\nViT-L/14.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u805a\u7c7b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u805a\u7c7b\u5934\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cViT-B/32\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927ViT-L/14\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent\nadvancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can\neffectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while\nmaintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution\nand summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion\nmodels are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information\nredundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a\ndistilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided\nCurriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple\ncurricula.

To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks.

We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

However, due to dependencies across the original document,\ncontextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each\nchunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows\nto produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in\nretrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer\nchunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of\ninformation they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still\nrequire returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human\nbandwidth.\n  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short\nchunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance\nretrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.\nWe further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode\nsuch situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm\nand develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we\ncurate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated\nretrieval capabilities.

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL\npipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class\ndescriptions rather than simple class names.

To address these challenges, we\npropose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A\ngrounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated\npathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial\ncontext) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text\nencoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,\ncapturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment\nwith visual features.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents.

A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a\nfine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most\neffectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess.

Recent\nstudies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the\nin-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic\nrelationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To\nthis end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a\ntraining-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window\nfor adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed\nfrequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic\nrelationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric\nscaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across\nvarying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention\nmechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different\nsequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range\ndependencies.

Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show\nthat MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even\nagainst unseen generators like Sora.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiraGe\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5224\u522b\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6cdb\u5316AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7c7b\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7c7b\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u6216\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "MiraGe\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u5316CLIP\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u522b\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MiraGe\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u5982Sora\uff09\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MiraGe\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the\nmodel is prone to \"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of\npreviously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a new CKGE model BAKE.

Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots.

However, existing adaptation methods are\ndesigned by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.\nInspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code\ngeneration, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation\n(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation\nalgorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as\nthe key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage\nLLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential\nmanner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search\nspace through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability\nand efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,\nweb based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective\nautomatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nalgorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous\nmanually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification\nsetting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in\nrecognition accuracy.

Traditional DG\nassumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the\nemergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this\nassumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set\nPivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,\nwhich is more suitable for current research and application requirements.\nUnlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid\ndomain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world\nconditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic\nadaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven\nfeature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)\nVFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone\ntask-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.\nBuilding on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines\na Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate\nVFM performance in targeted scenarios.

Recently,\nreplay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by\nrehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing\nhistorical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,\nexemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without\nstoring raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge\nrepresentations. To this end, we propose to condense information from\nsequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling\nPrivacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the\ntraining characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the\ncondensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the\nprivacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more\nrepresentative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align\nthe current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay\nsamples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy\neffectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused\nby domain shifts.

However, in real clinical scenarios,\ndue to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face\nthe issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the\nfeatures of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with\nresampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or\nunderfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we\npropose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis\n(CLIMD).

Multiple Instance Learning\n(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level\nprediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while\noverlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction\nstage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap\nand suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown\npromise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds\nupon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.\nThis inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and\ninterdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and\ndrastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a\nCascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an\naverage of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust\nslide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling\nstrategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both\nmodel-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a\nLocal-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution\nWSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global\ncontextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR\nis optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity.

We observe that factual information is widely distributed across\nthis map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted\nby most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise\nconsistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention\nProcessing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages\nfactual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve\nfactual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention\nto progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by\naggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a\nGlobal-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after\nglobal attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy.

As Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive\nway that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated\nexperimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk\nof losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of\nKahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,\nincluding today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.\n  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how\nthese models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also\ndemonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk\nappetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded\nwithin the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I\nfind that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do\ncivilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that\nlanguage models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also\nthat these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple\ngains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the\ncontingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios.

This task poses significant challenges due to\ncomplex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly\ndeformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single\nmodel to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse\namodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to\nadopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different\nshape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's\nunderlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and\ninsufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized\nexperts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific\nsparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to\nlearn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a\nlightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,\nShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures\nkey shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to\nthe most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert\nrouting. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting\noccluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well\ninterpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining\nhigh capacity and efficiency.

However, their application to semantic segmentation is\nhindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as\nsegmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM\npre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation\nscenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To\novercome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based\nsegmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited\ndata and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.\nSpecifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a\ndomain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,\ninstance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the\nsegmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of\nthe backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization.

The integrated\nRein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,\ndaytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,\nnighttime scenes) without any target labels.

However, existing automatic database O&M methods,\nincluding commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On\nthe one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,\nmetric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and\ncannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting\nguidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve\nfragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate\ninaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a\nreasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear\ndiagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four\nmainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates\nthat DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher\nin root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "DBAIOps\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406LLM\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fd0\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u6216LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "DBAIOps\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u8bca\u65ad\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1800+\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u8c31\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cDBAIOps\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad834.85%\u548c47.22%\u3002", "conclusion": "DBAIOps\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u63a8\u7406LLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fd0\u7ef4\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The latter, also known as region-based\ncorrespondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to\nenable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at\npixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two\nsteps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.\nIn this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly \"searching for\ncorresponding prompts\", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models\n(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we\nintroduce the \"corresponding prompt problem\", which aims to identify a\ncorresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,\nsuch that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of\ncorresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an \"inverse\nprompt\" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,\ninverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a\nnovel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs\nby marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial\ndimensions.

Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is\ngenerated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting.

Finally, we perform\ntargeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We\nestablish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to\nquantitatively evaluate our method.

To address these challenges, we\npropose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework\nthat integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The\ndetector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic\ndistances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through\na weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained\nanalysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a\nparameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does\nnot require any external clean model.

A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks.

In this study, we developed a unique\nmulti-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian\ndairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,\nincluding instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity\nseamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by\ngeometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The\ndetection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow\ndataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an\nupgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for\ninstance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.\nEven with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman\nfilter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for\nobject tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT\nRealtime.

However, autonomously\nbuilding computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the\ncomplexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the\nneed for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we\nintroduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework\nthat transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly\ninto optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given\nonly raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge\noutputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training\nvirtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:\nTask Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature\nretrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop\noptimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated\ngeneration of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts\nwith differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to\ncollaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.\nWe demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,\nusing six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and\ncytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently\noutperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment\nin an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of\nCAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated\ncritiques.

We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event\nrepresentation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse\ntasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous\nmethods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T\nscaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the\nlocal feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial\nand temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are\napplied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute\nefficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to\nlearn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which\nenables standard vision models to process event data without architecture\nchange. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent\nout-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks\nand 10 datasets (Fig.1).

To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided\nTransformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of\nthe current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and\ndependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns\npredefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using\ntransformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a\nteacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context\nassigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The\nteacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy\nmap to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the\nstudent to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial\ndependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded\ntokens based on high-dependency context.

To close this gap, we, for the\nfirst time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations\nduring free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a\n36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search\nscenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on\ndesktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach\nbased on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art\napproach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related\npotentials.

Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation.

To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal\nintervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant\ninformation to enable proactive and goal-driven responses.

To anchor our research and\nfacilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark\nfeaturing complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from\npeer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nHealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nagent frameworks.

Beyond traditional\nsingle-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various\nobject classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade\nstandard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled\nBackdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured\ndisentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor\nthreats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image\nrepresentations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in\nthe embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By\nleveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes\nthe latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual\nprompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships\nbetween triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and\nobject representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the\ntrigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling\ntrigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with\nfeature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens\nin a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel\ntrigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering\ndeeper insights into adversarial attack patterns.

This limitation has led to efforts to generate images\nconditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work\nmodifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated\nimages by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.\nThis enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,\ngenerally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two\ncommon issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate\nimages that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches\nneglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.\nSpecifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired\nconditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve\nthis, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired\nconditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image\nprompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention\nmodifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image\nand alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and\nvalues from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the\ngenerated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new\nself-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys\nand values from both images rather than selecting between them.

To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified\nhierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive\nassessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by\ndual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation\nenvironments via a dual-system adaptation architecture.

To\nbridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control\nabstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level\nactuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs\non physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM\nintroduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically\nexplores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for\nsafety-critical scenario generation.

Compared to traditional methods based on\nTransformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based\napproaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic\nnature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often\nfail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted\nframes, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in\npredicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes\nStarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates\nhistorical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to\nsignificantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose\npredictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose\nmapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating\npreviously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose\nIntegration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative\nhistorical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring\ntemporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play\nSpatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the\ndenoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial\nanatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and\nrealistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsuperior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Traditional\nfree-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,\ncomplicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology\nreport generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information\ninto standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on\nclassification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require\npredefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based\napproaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence\npatterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important\ndetails. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes\ndataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation\nframework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that\nincludes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical\nlocations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and\nwell-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,\nhigh-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized\nevaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy\nbut also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a\nclinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements\ncritical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with\nhuman assessments.

However, constrained by the context\nlength limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically\nexhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended\ninput frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference\ntechniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.\nDifferently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame\ninputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach\n\\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception\ncapabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef\nreconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as\nmulti-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers\nclues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query\nactivations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is\nderived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from\nparallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that\nare neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token\nsequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing\ncosts in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency\nand effectiveness.

Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are\ninherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired\nintensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting\ntheir scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose\nAttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of\naesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by\nleveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and\nemploy a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to\nlearnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables\nintuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training\noverhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines.

However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this\ndegradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision\ncounterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To\naddress the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an\neffective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.\nUnfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models\nas they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is\nunsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory\nand latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to\nimprove their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a\ncontinual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model\nadaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden\nof existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme\nto store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory\nconsumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and\nfostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation.

However, AT creates an inherent trade-off\nbetween clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed\nto the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning\nof hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact\nfor the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard\nadversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already\nlearned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous\nviews, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard\nadversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the\ntrade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception\nconsistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore\nthe information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a\nsmoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its\nestablishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT\nobjective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change\nsmoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust\nPerception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the\ncurrent accuracy-robustness trade-off.

However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability.

To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a\ncomprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,\nfiltering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a\nprogressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,\nevolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to\nparagraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially\nenhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,\nQwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as\nEnglish, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic\nlanguages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an\nimproved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional\ntext-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also\nimage-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent\nrepresentations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT.

In this work,\nwe introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot\nframework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion\nprocess in rectified flow models.

The method computes optimal transport paths\nbetween image and noise distributions while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS\nscores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating\nsuperior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We\nevaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%\nimprovements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and\nLSUN-Church datasets, respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the\norigins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify\nunder-optimized Gaussians as the primary source.

This methodological contribution lies in\napplying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal\npoints, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for\ndenoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on\nstructured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of\nany data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric\nfidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with\ncomplex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder\nfluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car\nexternal aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for\nreal-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit\nmodels (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps\ncompared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to\n200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our\nproposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion\nmodel: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters\nwhile achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive\ncomparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and\nMeshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all\nthree physical systems.

To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified\n3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.\nThus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate\nsystem defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a\ncollision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further\nrefine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth\nnoting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables\nthe reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our\nexperiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D\nclothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to\ncategory-specific methods.

In addition to maintaining\nsmooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse\nmotion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly\nwhen it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to\ndiffer meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with\nIn-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion\ngeneration. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it\nenhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without\nintroducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling\nprocess of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.\nSpecifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained\ngenerative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an\noptimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple\ncriteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play\nmulti-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative\nmodels, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational\nautoencoders, and generative adversarial networks.

In this work, we address both\nsegmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI\ndataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage\ntraining strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels\nusing the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned\nfeatures to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen\nvalidation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of\n0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR\nclassification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic\nfeatures extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast\nDCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\\%, and up to 75\\% in some\nsubgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive\nfields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on\nadvanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further\nimprove performance and generalization.

The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits\ndistillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph\ndistillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent\nattention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD\nintroduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial\nor noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is\nconducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an\ninternal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose\nlevels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD\nconsistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,\nsupporting its potential in real-world diagnostics.

Essentially, $\\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for\nthe softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the\nloss function. We prove theoretically that $\\epsilon$-softmax can achieve\nnoise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss\nfunction. Recognizing that $\\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly\nreduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one\nsymmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and\neffective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise.

We performed the first\nlarge-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain\nMRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes\nverifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal\nsources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical\nlesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals\nsystematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM\nconsistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest\nincompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate\nthat these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design\nprinciples tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for\nneuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,\nwhich makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently\naccurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this\ndomain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation\nand validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior\nneuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and\nprovide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GradCAM\u548cLRP\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800cSmoothGrad\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u6e90\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u4eba\u4e3a\u4fee\u6539\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "GradCAM\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0cLRP\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u865a\u5047\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800cSmoothGrad\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u505a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u914d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}
