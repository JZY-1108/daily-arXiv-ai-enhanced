### [1] [Are you sure? Measuring models bias in content moderation through uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22699)
*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督方法，使用不确定性作为代理指标来衡量内容审核模型对弱势群体的偏见，发现某些预训练模型对少数群体预测准确率高但置信度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在内容审核中普遍存在种族和社会偏见问题，现有基于性能的指标难以有效衡量模型公平性，需要开发新的偏见评估方法。

Method: 使用保形预测技术计算模型不确定性，基于11个模型对女性和非白人标注者标注消息的分类不确定性来评估模型偏见。

Result: 结果显示某些预训练模型对少数群体预测准确率高但置信度低，不确定性指标与F1分数等性能指标存在差异。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型置信度可以识别哪些标注者群体在预训练模型中代表性更好，为模型去偏过程提供指导。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

### [2] [AccessEval: Benchmarking Disability Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22703)
*Srikant Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实领域和9种残疾类型上的表现，发现针对残疾相关查询的回复比中性查询更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多，反映了模型中存在的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究LLM在处理现实查询时对不同残疾群体的偏见问题，揭示模型行为中存在的歧视性倾向及其对残障用户的实际影响。

Method: 使用AccessEval基准，通过配对的中性查询和残疾相关查询，在6个领域评估21个LLM，分析情感、社会认知和事实准确性等指标。

Result: 残疾相关查询的回复情感更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误率更高，听力、言语和行动障碍群体受影响最严重，不同领域和残疾类型间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM中存在的系统性偏见可能对残障用户造成实际伤害，强调了在日常生活应用中减轻偏见的重要性，需要弥合技术评估与用户影响之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

### [3] [RAR$^2$: Retrieval-Augmented Medical Reasoning via Thought-Driven Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22713)
*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAR²框架，通过联合学习改进推理增强检索和检索增强推理，在医学问答任务中优于传统RAG方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时存在局限，表面级输入无法反映任务真实知识需求，限制了临床相关知识的检索和整合能力

Method: 构建思维过程揭示隐含知识需求，使用混合偏好对数据集和DPO训练模型，设计两种测试时扩展策略探索框架边界

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上实验证明RAR²的有效性，优于有或无微调的RAG基线方法

Conclusion: RAR²框架通过联合优化推理和检索过程，显著提升了处理复杂医学问题的能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

### [4] [TRUEBench: Can LLM Response Meet Real-world Constraints as Productivity Assistant?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22715)
*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，通过多语言支持、隐含约束识别和多轮对话复杂性来更真实地评估指令跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令跟随能力方面存在不足，包括缺乏多语言性、未能捕捉用户请求中的隐含约束，以及忽视多轮对话的复杂性。

Method: 开发了TRUEBench基准测试，包含12种语言的输入提示、多语言指令、严格的评估标准来捕捉显性和隐性约束，以及具有累积约束和上下文切换的复杂多轮对话场景。

Result: 实验表明TRUEBench比现有基准测试更具挑战性，即使是像OpenAI o1这样的强大模型也仅达到69.07%的总体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实际生产力环境中的能力提供了严格而现实的评估，突显了它们的优势和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis with Dynamic Attention Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22729)
*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF)框架，通过动态注意力机制融合文本和语音特征，在无需微调编码器的情况下显著提升多模态情感分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了语音中的语调、韵律等非语言线索，无法准确捕捉真实情感意图。

Method: 使用冻结的预训练语言模型文本嵌入和语音编码器声学特征，通过自适应注意力机制为每个话语动态加权不同模态。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中，DAF模型持续优于静态融合和单模态基线，F1分数显著提升，预测误差降低。消融研究证实动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，该方法为情感预测提供了更稳健的基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

### [6] [Enabling Approximate Joint Sampling in Diffusion LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22738)
*Parikshit Bansal,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单个前向传播中生成多个token，平衡了生成质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型按顺序采样token，确保从正确联合分布中采样，而掩码扩散语言模型并行去掩码token会导致偏离真实联合分布，影响准确性但提高速度。

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM上添加轻量级单层采样器，一次完整模型前向传播后，仅通过采样器层的多次前向传播生成多个去掩码token，采样器训练以模拟完整模型的精确联合采样。

Result: 在预训练和指令调优模型的语言建模及数学编程任务中，当每个去噪步骤去掩码4个token时，采样算法相对于真实联合分布的MAUVE得分达到0.87（边际基线为0.31）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了扩散语言模型中的近似联合采样，显著提高了生成质量，同时保持了并行生成的速度优势。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

### [7] [Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739)
*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了无痛激活引导（PAS），一种完全自动化的激活引导方法，无需手动构建提示对或特征标注，就能利用标记数据集实现语言模型的行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重后训练方法耗时昂贵，提示引导方法不够精确且需要手动试错，而当前激活引导技术需要手工构建提示对或大量特征标注，使用不便。

Method: PAS通过自动化的方式构建激活向量，无需人工干预，包括内省变体（iPAS），可以廉价训练、轻松存储并按需激活。

Result: 在3个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能（偏见任务提升10.1%，道德任务5.2%，对齐任务34.8%），但对智能导向任务无效，且能在上下文学习和监督微调基础上提供额外增益。

Conclusion: PAS为语言模型后训练提供了一个实用、自动化的选择，明确了激活引导的适用场景和部署方式。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

### [8] [MIRAGE: Multi-hop Reasoning with Ambiguity Evaluation for Illusory Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22750)
*Jeonghyun Park,Ingeol Baek,Seunghyun Yoon,Haeun Jang,Aparna Garimella,Akriti Jain,Nedim Lipka,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MIRAGE基准来评估多跳问答中的歧义性挑战，并开发了CLARION框架来显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答往往涉及与推理过程密不可分的歧义性，这带来了独特挑战，因为单一问题可能产生多个推理路径，每个子问题都需要独立解决歧义。

Method: 引入MIRAGE基准，包含1,142个高质量歧义多跳问题示例，分为句法、通用和语义歧义三类，并通过多LLM验证流程进行严格筛选。同时提出CLARION多智能体框架来处理这种挑战。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的模型在MIRAGE基准上也表现不佳，证实了结合歧义解决和多步推理是一个独特且重大的挑战。CLARION框架显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多跳推理中的歧义性是一个重要研究方向，CLARION框架为开发更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

### [9] [ML2B: Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark For AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22768)
*Ekaterina Trofimova,Zosia Shamina,Maria Selifanova,Artem Zaitsev,Remi Savchuk,Maxim Minets,Daria Ozerova,Emil Sataev,Denis Zuenko,Andrey E. Ustyuzhanin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ML2B是首个用于评估多语言机器学习代码生成的基准测试，包含30个Kaggle竞赛任务翻译成13种语言，结果显示非英语任务的性能下降15-45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习代码生成基准主要限于英语，忽视了机器学习的全球性和多语言特性，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建ML2B基准，包含30个Kaggle竞赛翻译成13种语言，涵盖表格、文本和图像数据类型，使用AIDE自动化框架进行端到端评估。

Result: 结果显示在非英语任务上存在显著的15-45%性能下降，揭示了多语言表示学习在代码生成中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: ML2B基准和评估框架为多语言机器学习代码生成研究提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在多语言场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline
construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks
for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global
and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we
present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code
generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural
languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured
metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ
AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science
pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our
results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks,
highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for
code generation. The benchmark, evaluation framework, and comprehensive results
are made available through our GitHub repository to facilitate future research
in multilingual ML code generation: https://github.com/enaix/ml2b.

### [10] [ArFake: A Multi-Dialect Benchmark and Baselines for Arabic Spoof-Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22808)
*Mohamed Maged,Alhassan Ehab,Ali Mekky,Besher Hassan,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个多方言阿拉伯语伪造语音数据集，通过评估多个TTS模型发现FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型可能限制泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式文本转语音模型的发展，区分真实和合成语音变得困难，特别是对于研究较少的阿拉伯语及其多种方言。大多数伪造检测研究集中在英语上，阿拉伯语存在显著研究空白。

Method: 构建评估流程：使用嵌入方法和分类器头、基于MFCC特征的经典机器学习算法以及RawNet2架构训练分类器；计算基于人类评分的平均意见得分；通过自动语音识别模型处理原始和合成数据集以测量词错误率。

Result: FishSpeech在Casablanca语料库的阿拉伯语语音克隆中优于其他TTS模型，产生更真实和具有挑战性的合成语音样本。

Conclusion: FishSpeech在阿拉伯语语音克隆方面表现最佳，但仅使用单一TTS模型构建数据集可能限制泛化能力，建议考虑合并多个模型的音频或选择最佳模型。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

### [11] [EditGRPO: Reinforcement Learning with Post -Rollout Edits for Clinically Accurate Chest X-Ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22812)
*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，专门用于优化放射学报告生成，通过临床动机奖励提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中虽然性能有所提升，但其监督微调目标并未明确与临床效果对齐。

Method: EditGRPO结合了在线策略探索和离线策略指导，通过在训练过程中注入句子级详细修正来解决RL中的探索困境和采样效率问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM上应用EditGRPO，在四个主要胸部X光报告生成数据集上，CheXbert、GREEN、Radgraph和RATEScore指标平均提升3.4%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO不仅超越了SFT和普通GRPO基线，还展现出优越的域外泛化能力，在未见数据集上平均性能提升5.9%。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

### [12] [Critique-Coder: Enhancing Coder Models by Critique Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22824)
*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)方法，通过在标准RL训练中融入20%的CRL数据，训练模型生成对(问题,解决方案)对的批判，仅基于批判的最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致来给予奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要关注生成响应，缺乏显式培养批判或反思能力的机制。受CFT和CGD等研究的启发，需要开发能明确教导LLMs如何进行批判的方法。

Method: 提出CRL方法，模型任务是为给定的(问题,解决方案)对生成批判，奖励仅基于批判的最终判断标签(c ∈ {True, False})是否与真实标签c*一致。在此基础上构建Critique-Coder，在标准RL数据中替换20%为CRL数据进行混合训练。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上持续优于仅使用RL的基线模型。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到60%以上，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1等推理模型。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的有力补充，在编码数据集上应用CRL能增强通用推理和批判能力，这些能力可广泛迁移到各种任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject是一种针对LLM代理的新型攻击方法，通过模拟原生聊天模板格式和多轮对话来实施间接提示注入攻击，相比传统方法显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的代理与外部环境交互的增加，间接提示注入成为新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操纵中的脆弱性尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了ChatInject攻击方法：1）将恶意载荷格式化为原生聊天模板格式；2）开发多轮对话变体，通过多轮对话引导代理接受可疑操作；3）在多个前沿LLM上进行全面实验验证。

Result: 1）ChatInject攻击成功率显著高于传统方法（AgentDojo从5.18%提升至32.05%，InjecAgent从15.13%提升至45.90%）；2）基于聊天模板的载荷具有强跨模型迁移性；3）现有防御方法对此类攻击基本无效。

Conclusion: 当前代理系统存在严重安全漏洞，基于聊天模板的攻击方法能够有效绕过现有防御，多轮对话变体尤其危险，需要开发新的防御机制。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识库中的相关部分来改进多轮对话响应选择性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容用于匹配响应候选，但其中很多无用信息会影响匹配效果，需要识别真正相关的部分

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关上下文和知识，然后让响应候选分别与选中的上下文和知识交互，最后融合表示来更自信地后选相关知识进行匹配

Result: 在两个基准数据集上测试，模型性能优于现有方法，能有效检测相关上下文和知识用于响应选择

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测上下文和知识的相关部分，显著提升了多轮对话响应选择的性能

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了In-Context Routing (ICR)方法，在注意力对数层面内化可泛化的ICL模式，通过可学习的输入条件路由器调节注意力对数，实现一次训练多次使用的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式上下文学习方法主要依赖向残差流中注入偏移向量，这些向量通常从标记演示或任务特定对齐构建，未能充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限。

Method: ICR提取ICL过程中出现的可重用结构方向，并使用可学习的输入条件路由器相应地调节注意力对数，实现train-once-and-reuse框架。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上评估，ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前隐式ICL方法，并在现有方法难以处理的域外任务上展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICR有望推动ICL实际应用价值的边界。

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究对45个大语言模型进行了8种认知偏见的系统性评估，发现LLMs在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出与人类相似的认知偏见行为，模型规模和提示细节对偏见敏感性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，需要评估它们是否表现出人类常见的认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 开发了基于多选题任务的评估框架，与心理学家合作构建了220个决策场景的数据集，通过控制提示变体生成了超过280万个LLM响应。

Result: LLMs在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性等8种偏见中表现出显著的偏见一致性行为。更大的模型规模（>32B参数）在39.5%的情况下减少偏见，更详细的提示使大多数偏见减少高达14.9%。

Conclusion: 大语言模型确实表现出类似人类的认知偏见，模型规模和提示设计是影响偏见敏感性的重要因素，需要在AI系统部署中考虑这些发现。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和transformer的混合方法，结合词典特征来预测阿拉伯语文档可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语文档级可读性预测问题，探索图神经网络与transformer模型的融合优势。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕捉语言关系。使用SAMER词典特征和阿拉伯语transformer嵌入，GNN和transformer作为独立分支训练，通过后期融合结合预测。

Result: 混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或transformer分支。

Conclusion: 融合方法在文档级具有优势，但GNN单独方法在句子级可读性预测上更精确。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

TL;DR: HEART框架通过情感驱动的提示进行迭代自我修正，利用基于六种基本情感的情感反馈来引导语言模型摆脱错误的推理路径，在复杂推理任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自反思策略主要关注逻辑或结构优化，未能利用情感反馈的指导潜力。受心理学研究启发，情绪可以调节认知表现，因此引入情感驱动的迭代修正方法。

Method: HEART使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的简洁情感短语提供反馈，通过系统变化情感语调来引导模型探索更优的推理路径，在多个推理基准上进行评估。

Result: 在有验证器指导的情况下，情感迭代协议能显著解锁更深层推理能力，准确率持续大幅提升；但在无验证器设置下难以稳定利用这些收益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿不仅在于逻辑精炼，还在于理解和利用模型的'情感核心'，无验证器设置下的稳定性是未来工作的关键挑战。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种集成心理理论(ToM)的对话智能体ToMAgent，通过生成心理状态和对话前瞻来提升LLM在社交对话中的目标达成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交智能体通常不整合心理理论，而心理理论是人类社交智能的关键方面，能够显著提升对话效果。

Method: 引入ToMAgent(ToMA)，通过将心理理论与对话前瞻相结合，生成对实现对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 在Sotopia交互式社交评估基准上的实验表明，该方法优于一系列基线模型，展现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为。

Conclusion: 该研究在整合心理理论以构建社交智能LLM智能体方面迈出了重要一步，能够实现长期适应性并维持更好的伙伴关系。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Motivation: 研究旨在证明任务特定优化可以产生超越通用系统的模型，同时大幅减少计算资源需求，解决信息提取任务中的固有模糊性问题。

Method: 采用合成数据生成管道产生28万训练样本，使用LoRA进行参数高效微调（仅修改0.53%权重），并通过GRPO强化学习和基于语义相似度的奖励函数进行优化。

Result: 在1000个文档提取任务基准上获得0.573的平均奖励，优于GPT-4.1（0.457）、o3（0.464）和GPT-4.1-2025（0.459）。

Conclusion: 任务特定优化能够产生超越通用系统的模型，同时显著减少计算资源需求，为高效信息提取提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在药物相关任务中表现不佳：药物剂型匹配错误率高，药物相互作用识别不一致，药物订单句子生成准确率仅65.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在药物相关任务中的一致性，包括药物剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别和药物订单生成，以了解其在医疗诊断中的实际应用价值。

Method: 使用GPT-4o进行三个实验：药物名称到剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别（使用内部知识和网络搜索）、药物订单句子生成。通过余弦相似度、Levenshtein相似度、ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1和临床医生手动评估来量化准确性。

Result: GPT-4o在药物剂型匹配中表现差（仅49%完全正确），经常遗漏现有剂型或虚构不存在的剂型。药物相互作用识别中，网络搜索提高了有相互作用时的准确性（69.2% vs 54.7%），但无相互作用时表现更差。药物订单句子生成准确率为65.8%。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在所有测试中表现整体较差，凸显了需要通过临床医生标注的数据集进行领域特定训练，并建立全面的评估框架来基准化性能。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Conclusion: LLM能够有效表达故事文本隐含的场景知识，这种能力对于生成和评估插图具有重要影响。

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在等量计算条件下，显式训练归纳电路并不能持续改善上下文学习能力。虽然Bi-Induct课程能加速小规模模型中归纳头的出现，但这不总是带来更好的泛化性能。自然文本训练的模型在标准基准测试中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试在预训练期间显式激活归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习能力，还是自然文本在等量计算条件下已经足够。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入前向复制（归纳）、后向复制（反归纳）或平衡混合数据，在等FLOPs条件下训练0.13B到1B参数模型。

Result: Bi-Induct加速了小规模模型中归纳头的出现，但未能持续改善上下文学习泛化能力。自然文本训练的1B模型在函数式上下文学习探测中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 单纯诱导激活不足以保证上下文学习增益，关键在于这些电路是否变得功能必要。需要机制感知的预训练诊断和数据混合来培养负载承载结构。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在噪声环境中识别口语词汇时所使用的语言表征类型，特别是这些模型如何处理语音学和形态学现象。

Method: 研究S3M变体在识别频繁英语名词和动词屈折变化时的表征特性，分析其几何结构如何连接词干与屈折形式。

Result: 发现S3M表征具有全局线性几何结构，能够有效连接英语名词和动词与其规则屈折形式，但这种结构不直接对应语音或形态单位，而是反映词汇间的分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现提出了可能支持人类口语词汇识别的候选表征策略，挑战了语音学和形态学需要独立语言表征的传统假设。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的表格问答需要处理结构化数据库和半结构化表格，但现有基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表示形式本身对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用语言化管道生成配对的结枃化和半结构化表格，保持内容不变而改变结构，并引入包含表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量等维度的诊断基准。

Result: 实验显示SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上性能下降，LLM具有灵活性但精度较低，混合方法在噪声模式条件下表现最佳。这些效应随着表格增大和查询变复杂而加剧。

Conclusion: 表示形式在表格问答性能中起着核心作用，没有单一方法在所有条件下都表现优异。研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了可行见解，为开发适用于多样化现实世界数据格式的更强健混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

TL;DR: ADAM是首个系统评估多模态大语言模型在传记推理能力的框架，包含多语言多模态数据集AdamDB、基于布鲁姆分类法的评估基准AdamBench，以及针对传记上下文优化的检索增强生成系统AdamRAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传记知识是事实知识的关键维度但研究不足，现有模型在传记推理方面存在幻觉问题，特别是对知名度较低的人物。

Method: 构建包含400万人的多语言多模态数据集AdamDB；开发基于布鲁姆分类法的六层推理评估基准AdamBench；提出针对传记上下文的检索增强生成系统AdamRAG。

Result: AdamRAG显著提升开源模型性能，对闭源模型有适度改善；在低阶推理任务上提升最大；人物知名度强烈影响准确性；面部图像的多模态输入改善效果较小且不稳定。

Conclusion: ADAM建立了首个认知、文化和多模态基础的传记评估基准，推动了多语言、准确且抗幻觉的多模态大语言模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Conclusion: 成功创建了多模型生成的英语和捷克语语料库，为LLM生成文本与人类文本的语言学比较提供了宝贵资源，数据在CC BY 4.0许可下开放获取。

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely
available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are
under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search

TL;DR: ReMemR1是一个具有回调增强记忆的内存增强代理，通过选择性检索整个记忆历史来支持非线性推理，结合多级奖励强化学习来改善长上下文问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有'边读边记'方法存在的不可逆前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题，提升长上下文问答中关键证据分散在数百万token中的处理能力。

Method: 提出ReMemR1内存增强代理，支持选择性检索整个记忆历史，允许非线性推理和早期证据重新访问；同时提出多级奖励强化学习(RLMLR)，结合最终答案奖励和密集步骤级信号。

Result: 在长文档问答实验中，相比现有基于内存的方法取得了显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过回调增强记忆和多级奖励强化学习，有效缓解信息退化问题，改善监督机制，支持多跳内存利用，为长上下文推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对多智能体辩论系统中谄媚行为的操作框架，揭示了谄媚是导致辩论失败的核心模式，会引发过早共识和准确性下降，并提出了相应的设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在辩论系统中表现出的谄媚行为会导致辩论过早达成共识，削弱多智能体辩论的优势。现有研究主要关注用户-LLM谄媚，而智能体间谄媚在辩论中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：1) 为多智能体辩论系统定义谄媚行为；2) 开发新指标评估智能体谄媚水平及其对信息交换的影响；3) 系统研究不同角色（辩手和评委）谄媚水平对去中心化和中心化辩论框架结果的影响。

Result: 发现谄媚是核心失败模式：在达成正确结论前放大分歧崩溃；导致准确性低于单智能体基线；源于辩手驱动和评委驱动两种不同的失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了可操作的多智能体辩论系统设计原则，有效平衡智能体互动中的建设性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Motivation: 由于获取监督数据成本上升，大语言模型的自改进需求增加。传统自评估方法在不可验证任务中存在计算开销大和过度自信问题。

Method: 提出语义投票机制，用轻量级句子嵌入模型量化语义相似度，实现软匹配替代硬匹配，避免传统自评估的局限性。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在计算效率和整体性能上优于自评估方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务提供了一种轻量级且有效的自改进方案，解决了传统自评估方法的计算负担和内在偏见问题。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

TL;DR: EviPath是一个为RAG代理开发设计的证据锚定推理路径合成范式，通过任务分解、忠实子问题回答和对话微调，显著提升了语言模型在复杂推理和工具使用方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成代理开发缺乏过程级监督，难以有效指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策等代理能力。强化学习存在稀疏奖励问题，现有数据合成方法只能产生思维链推理而无法建模环境交互。

Method: EviPath包含三个核心组件：1）溯因子任务规划：将问题分解为子问题并基于依赖关系迭代规划最优解路径；2）忠实子问题回答：使用支持证据构建代理环境来生成推理思路和答案；3）对话微调：将完整的代理-环境交互轨迹格式化为适合监督微调的对话格式。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著且一致地优于最先进的基线方法，在开放域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath使语言模型能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂推理和工具使用能力，为RAG代理开发提供了有效的训练数据合成解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信集的几何框架来量化神经文本生成中的不确定性，通过分析5万个故事发现现有模型在捕捉人类创作变异性方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅为0.434。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在创造性任务中的不确定性是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的情况下。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）的几何框架，分析WritingPrompts数据集中500个创意写作提示，每个提示有10个人类续写，评估4个语言模型和5种解码策略，生成10万个故事。

Result: 置信集分析显示在捕捉人类创作变异性方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅为0.434。解码策略选择对总认知不确定性的贡献为39.4%到72.0%。模型规模与校准质量相关性弱，基础模型和指令调优模型在校准质量上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创意对齐提供了可操作的见解，并发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为d²Cache的训练免费近似KV缓存框架，用于加速扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)的推理效率，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略自适应更新KV状态，同时实现推理加速和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLMs)由于依赖双向注意力机制，无法像自回归模型那样直接受益于标准的KV缓存，导致推理效率较低。

Method: d²Cache框架采用两阶段细粒度选择策略：1)识别需要更新的token；2)自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存其余token的KV状态以供重用。该框架还支持准从左到右生成，缓解序列末尾token的过早过度自信问题。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream两个代表性dLLM上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，而且在生成质量方面也获得了持续改进。

Conclusion: d²Cache是一种有效的训练免费解决方案，能够同时提升扩散式大语言模型的推理效率和生成质量，为dLLMs的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Motivation: 分子生成在药物发现和材料科学中至关重要，但LLM在少样本设置下使用SMILES表示生成有效分子具有挑战性。作者探索如何让LLM生成100%有效的分子。

Method: 引入SmiSelf跨化学语言框架，通过语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES，利用SELFIES的机制来纠正无效SMILES。

Result: 实验表明SmiSelf确保100%有效性，同时保持分子特性，在其他指标上保持甚至提升性能。

Conclusion: SmiSelf有助于扩展LLM在生物医学中的实际应用，且兼容所有基于SMILES的生成模型。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用推理方面表现出色，但在个性化推理方面存在困难，无法有效分析用户历史、推断独特偏好并生成定制化响应。

Method: 1. 开发数据驱动管道自动生成和语义标注推理链；2. 提出协同训练策略：先在标记数据上进行监督微调，然后进行多阶段强化学习；3. 强化学习使用复合奖励信号，整合基于标签的约束和带用户嵌入的个性化奖励模型。

Result: 在公开LaMP基准和自建数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的结果，在所有任务上比基础模型平均提升32.65%。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是解锁LLM真正个性化能力的高度有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

TL;DR: TReASURe是一种基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，通过UnmaskBranch分支策略和ResubstituteScore剪枝规则解决掩码扩散语言模型中的分支相关性和奖励评估方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型时面临两个关键挑战：(i)并行解掩码产生高度相关的分支，限制探索；(ii)通过采样完成进行奖励评估产生高方差估计，使剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含：(1)UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中解掩码，通过每个父节点单次模型调用实现令牌内容和揭示顺序的多样化；(2)ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换以低方差代理完成对部分掩码序列进行评分。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面达到最先进结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）机制中表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过改进的分支策略和剪枝规则有效解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的挑战，在多个评估指标上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长对话中性能下降，因为训练数据多为静态单轮对话，无法适应实时用户反馈。

Method: T2PAM范式利用用户反馈作为奖励信号估计最优策略，ROSA算法通过单步高效更新引导模型参数向理论最优策略靠近。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预训练方法：用潜在思维预训练语言模型，通过在生成每个token前先生成一个中间潜在思维（隐藏状态）来提升模型性能，在相同推理成本下比标准模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Chain-of-Thought（CoT）在测试时通过增加生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否能在预训练阶段通过增加计算步骤来改进每个token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（当前位置的最后一个隐藏状态），然后使用该潜在思维作为输入来预测实际的下一个token，允许模型在无约束连续空间中优化预测。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B模型显著优于在相同数据上训练的2.8B标准模型，在语言建模和多种下游任务上都表现更好。增加潜在思维数量能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过预训练时引入额外的计算步骤生成潜在思维，可以有效提升语言模型的性能，这种方法在相同计算成本下比单纯增加模型参数更有效。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段框架来解决LLM多智能体系统中的层次合规性问题，包括诊断、定位和对齐，通过局部微调提升指令冲突下的合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统在复杂任务中发展迅速，但系统级规则与用户指令冲突时的层次合规性失败阻碍了可靠性关键部署，现有宏观指标无法有效识别和解决这些微观违规问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 诊断 - 上下文角色依从性评分；2) 定位 - 注意力漂移分析识别关键层；3) 对齐 - 在定位层上安装LoRA并使用令牌加权DPO风格偏好目标进行优化。

Result: 在标准基准和多智能体框架上，该方法显著提高了指令层次合规性（如在AutoGen上MedQA任务提升5.60%），无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 通过诊断、定位和对齐的三阶段框架，可以有效解决LLM多智能体系统中的层次合规性问题，为可靠性关键部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过结合EEG和眼动追踪数据，发现在自然阅读条件下，短语结构构建先于语法类别检测，且结构深度是影响阅读偏差的最强因素，支持预测性的"树状支架"理解模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理语言学研究中关于语法处理时序的证据主要来自违反范式，这种方法混淆了语法类别检测和短语结构构建两个可分离的过程，并隐含假设短语结构构建在类别检测之后。本研究旨在在自然阅读条件下分离这两个过程并检验它们的时序关系。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库中同时记录的EEG和眼动追踪数据，通过分析注视转移、贝叶斯网络建模和注视相关电位来研究句法处理的时间动态。

Result: 注视转移分析显示读者优先在句法头部之间移动；贝叶斯网络模型表明结构深度是偏离线性阅读的最强驱动因素；注视相关电位显示句法惊奇度在词出现前(-184到-10ms)和早期整合阶段(48到300ms)影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明短语结构构建可以发生在语法类别检测之前，并且主导词汇影响，支持预测性的"树状支架"理解模型，扩展了当前关于句法处理时序的模型。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

Motivation: 解决推理大语言模型在少样本思维链提示下性能下降的悖论，探索演示如何有效转化为有用的推理策略。

Method: 提出Insight-to-Solve方法，将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹，可选地通过自我精炼提高连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，I2S和I2S+方法持续优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线，GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升14.0%，o1-mini在AIME和GPQA上分别提升2.7%和1.7%。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架，可以有效地利用上下文演示来提升推理大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2017-2025年间登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200榜单的K-pop歌曲中的语码转换现象，发现英语在全球成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男女艺人都有高频的语码转换和英语使用，且无显著性别差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究K-pop在全球市场成功背后的语言策略，特别是语码转换和英语歌词使用在全球化营销中的作用。

Method: 收集2017-2025年间登上Billboard Hot 100和Global 200的K-pop歌曲数据集，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等语言特征，并进行统计检验和分类任务。

Result: 英语在全球成功的K-pop歌曲中占主导地位，男女艺人语码转换频率都很高，无显著性别差异；女性独唱歌手更倾向于使用英语；分类任务预测性别准确率达0.76 F1分数；Hot 100榜单对英语使用要求更高。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词中的语言选择受到全球市场压力的影响，反映了艺人身份和榜单背景的风格模式，语码转换是K-pop全球化战略的重要组成部分。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

*Stefan Arnold,René Gröbner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Gemma-2语言模型，揭示了模型在生成介词短语时对工具性补语和属性性补语的偏好机制，并实现了通过调整单个注意力头来控制补语功能角色的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成介词短语时需要决定补语是作为工具性附加语还是属性修饰语，但其内部决策机制尚不明确，本研究旨在揭示并控制这一决策过程。

Method: 构建包含with引导介词短语的提示集，通过将激活投影到词汇空间来识别偏好工具性补语的注意力头，并通过缩放单个注意力头的值向量来调整补语功能分布。

Result: 模型对工具性补语有强烈偏好（3:4比例），通过调整单个注意力头可将工具性补语降至33%，属性性补语提升至36%。

Conclusion: 研究表明语言模型内部存在明确的补语功能角色偏好机制，且可以通过干预特定注意力头来有效控制生成结果，为理解模型内部决策提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

Motivation: 现有方法在多轮对话中无法有效维护进度感知，要么简化为单轮训练忽视任务规划，要么使用端到端强化学习存在冗余问题且缺乏明确的进度感知集成。

Method: PARL-MT框架包含：1）进度感知生成管道，自动构建对话摘要与未来任务规划的数据集；2）进度感知引导的强化学习算法，将进度感知集成到RL训练中减少上下文冗余。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，PARL-MT显著优于现有方法，证明了进度感知在实现稳健高效多轮函数调用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 进度感知是提升LLM多轮函数调用能力的关键因素，PARL-MT框架通过显式集成进度感知机制解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Motivation: 维基百科作为最大的开放知识语料库，其准确性至关重要。现有研究主要关注事实准确性，但对事实间的一致性缺乏系统研究。

Method: 提出语料库级不一致性检测任务，开发CLAIRE系统——结合LLM推理与检索的智能代理，能够发现潜在不一致声明并提供上下文证据。

Result: 用户研究显示87.5%的编辑使用CLAIRE后信心更高，在相同时间内多发现64.7%的不一致性。构建了首个真实维基百科不一致性基准WIKICOLLIDE。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE能够为编辑提供实用工具，帮助大规模改善知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Conclusion: Fin-ExBERT为金融对话挖掘提供了可部署的解决方案，支持批量评估、可视化和校准导出。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

TL;DR: A2D是一种针对扩散大语言模型的令牌级对齐方法，通过在任意位置检测有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，实现对任意解码顺序和预填充攻击的防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，且模板预填充攻击如DIJA能够绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: 采用令牌级对齐方法，在随机掩码条件下直接对齐安全性，使模型在检测到有害内容时发出[EOS]拒绝信号。

Result: 在安全基准测试中，A2D将DIJA攻击成功率从80%以上降至接近零（LLaDA-8B-Instruct为1.3%，Dream-v0-Instruct-7B为0.0%），并实现高达19.3倍的快速安全终止。

Conclusion: A2D方法有效提升了扩散大语言模型的安全性，能够抵御任意解码顺序和任意步骤预填充攻击，同时支持实时监控和早期拒绝。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策合规性评估需要专家级的逐步推理过程，但获取这种黄金标准的专家推理过程成本高昂。

Method: 引入Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT)，这是一种专门的生成推理链，作为推理桥梁来提升LLM的政策合规性评估能力。

Result: 使用PRT在推理时和训练时场景下，显著提升了开源模型和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策评估中达到新的SOTA。PRT还能提高LLM准确引用政策条款的能力，并通过高利用率影响合规决策。

Conclusion: PRT作为一种推理桥梁，能有效提升LLM在政策合规性评估中的表现，不仅提高准确性，还能改善政策条款引用能力。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

TL;DR: C-Evolve是一种基于共识的提示进化算法，通过群体投票聚合多个提示的输出结果来提升AI系统性能，在多个任务上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示进化算法主要关注单个提示的优化，很少探索通过聚合多个提示的输出来达成共识是否能进一步提升系统能力边界。

Method: 采用基于岛屿的进化算法维护种群多样性，从不同岛屿选择提示组成群体进行输出聚合，使用投票分数作为适应度评分来评估每个提示在群体中的贡献。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，HotpotQA达到70.67%，IFBench达到43.88%，分别比GEPA提升4.95%和2.73%；在GPT-4.1-mini上，IFBench达到47.96%，MATH基准达到95.33%。

Conclusion: C-Evolve通过群体共识机制能够产生和维护具有更高潜力的提示，逐步提升群体性能，在各种任务上展现出竞争优势。

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间实施双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性并平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，机器遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。现有SOTA遗忘方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题，且容易受到重新学习和越狱攻击。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：(1)表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练探针防御越狱攻击；(2)参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，平滑参数空间以减轻重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在多种攻击下优于SOTA基线方法，并在关键指标间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

TL;DR: 提出MedCritical框架，通过两阶段自学习机制提升小语言模型在医疗复杂推理任务中的表现，无需依赖大模型作为评判者，降低了成本和时间消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域复杂推理任务中，小语言模型表现不佳的问题，同时避免传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大模型作为评判者带来的高成本、低效率挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从教师模型提取长链思维模板指导学生模型生成复杂推理；第二阶段通过模型自迭代协作的直接偏好优化，让学生模型与微调后的自身修正轨迹对抗学习。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准测试中超越Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%，在7B级别小模型中达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自学习DPO方法能够让学生模型利用自身错误驱动的洞察来巩固技能和知识，以较低成本实现与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的结果。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: MetaAPO是一个动态耦合数据生成与模型训练的新型偏好优化框架，通过元学习器评估在线采样的潜在收益，为优化目标分配样本级元权重，有效平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线偏好数据与演化模型策略之间的分布不匹配问题，现有方法使用静态启发式或解耦的在线采样策略，但无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: 提出MetaAPO框架，使用轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"，评估在线采样相对于离线数据的潜在收益，指导有针对性的在线生成并为优化目标分配样本级元权重。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有的偏好优化方法，同时减少了42%的在线标注成本。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布，有效解决了偏好优化中的分布不匹配问题，显著提升了模型对齐效果并降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

TL;DR: 提出Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD)框架，通过双阶段对比机制减少多模态大语言模型在放射学中的医疗幻觉问题，无需训练即可提升临床准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中经常产生临床无依据的描述（医疗幻觉），这在需要准确性和图像基础输出的医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: CCD是一个无需训练和检索的推理框架，整合了任务特定放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，通过双阶段对比机制在生成过程中细化token级logits。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD在放射学报告生成任务上持续提升性能。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进的RRG模型时，RadGraph-F1指标提升高达17%。

Conclusion: CCD提供了一个轻量级且可泛化的解决方案，有效缓解医疗幻觉问题，成功连接了专家模型和多模态大语言模型在放射学中的应用。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Guard Vector方法，通过计算防护模型与预训练语言模型的参数差异，构建安全任务向量，结合目标语言模型创建目标防护模型，实现多语言扩展和模型可移植性，同时通过流式感知训练提高分类质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有防护模型在多语言扩展、模型可移植性和流式处理效率方面的局限性，需要一种更高效、可扩展的安全防护方法。

Method: 1. 计算Guard Vector作为防护模型与预训练模型的参数差异；2. 将Guard Vector与目标语言模型组合创建TGM；3. 采用流式感知方法，结合前缀训练和单令牌输出分类器；4. 通过前缀SFT对齐前缀输入与全文输入的行为。

Result: TGM在标准安全套件上提高了分类质量，支持中文、日文、韩文扩展，无需额外训练或目标语言标签；在Llama和Gemma骨干网上实现模型可移植性；前缀SFT保持流式处理下的分类质量；单令牌输出设计提高吞吐量并降低延迟。

Conclusion: Guard Vector方法有效减少了数据和计算需求，促进了流式感知评估实践，为构建更负责任的AI生态系统做出了贡献。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出在单次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验的方法，以降低计算成本，并通过1.5B参数模型验证了可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练实验是理解大语言模型学习、推理和记忆机制的重要工具，但计算成本高昂限制了实验规模。

Method: 在单次训练运行中同时进行10个实验，包括数据污染、投毒、记忆化等研究，使用1.5B参数模型在210B tokens上训练。

Result: 成功复现了多个先前工作的结果，并进行了知识获取、数学推理和水印等新研究，实验对模型训练动态和整体性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 单次训练运行中进行多个预训练实验的方法可以在有限计算预算下实现严谨的科学实验，但需要注意实验间可能的交互作用。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法难以稳定生成改进提示，效率低下且容易陷入局部最优。需要一种更高效的提示优化框架来克服这些限制。

Method: GRACE框架包含两个协同策略：门控精炼策略（引入反馈调节门和更新拒绝门来稳定改进提示）和自适应压缩策略（在优化停滞时提炼提示核心概念，重构优化轨迹）。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验显示，GRACE在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别实现了4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的平均相对性能提升，仅需先前方法25%的提示生成预算。

Conclusion: GRACE通过战略性地引入信息损失，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升，证明了其在提示优化中的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了机器翻译中的副文本显化任务，通过构建专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估LLM在文化术语翻译中的表现，发现LLM生成的副文本能提高理解但不如人工翻译，并揭示了文化中介的开放性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译方法在处理文化术语时只关注文本内解决方案，忽视了专业翻译人员在脚注和尾注中使用的副文本装置，这限制了文化内涵的忠实传递。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论构建了560个专家对齐的副文本数据集，评估了带推理追踪和不带推理追踪的LLM在显化选择和内容上的表现，采用了内在提示和代理检索方法。

Result: 实验表明该任务具有挑战性，LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解但效果远不如翻译人员创作；统计分析显示专业翻译人员在副文本使用上存在很大差异。

Conclusion: 副文本显化有潜力推动机器翻译超越语言对等，在单语解释和个性化适应方面具有应用前景，文化中介本质上是开放性的而非规定性的。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather
than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual
explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising
extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，其在自动评分中的应用日益广泛。LLM不仅能给出分数，还能提供评分依据，这为理解人类与AI评分员的推理过程提供了机会，有助于识别评分不一致的原因。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权kappa和归一化互信息评估GPT-4o、Gemini等LLM的评分准确性；使用余弦相似度评估理性依据的相似性；通过基于理性嵌入的主成分分析探索理性依据的聚类模式。

Result: 研究发现揭示了LLM在自动评分中的准确性和"思考"过程，提供了关于人类评分和LLM自动评分背后理性依据的深入理解。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解LLM在自动评分中的表现提供了重要见解，有助于改进对评分理性依据的理解，促进自动评分系统的优化。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估过于严格，许多正确答案因表面形式不同而被误判，导致低估了模型的参数化知识。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为唯一表面形式，并使用YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个常识问题)进行评估。

Result: RCD显著提升模型性能：Llama-3.1-70B从32.3% F1提升到46.0%，Llama-3.1-8B达到33.0%，甚至超过大模型在标准解码下的表现。

Conclusion: 标准解码方法低估了语言模型的知识，RCD方法能更准确地评估模型的真实能力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

Motivation: 当前对齐策略将安全性嵌入模型权重，导致控制隐式、静态且难以修改，需要更灵活的安全机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型家族上的广泛实验证实，CooT持续提升安全性和社交推理性能。

Conclusion: CooT将对齐转变为显式、动态、可审计的推理过程，允许灵活策略更新而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest
the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

*Dania Refai,Alaa Dalaq,Doaa Dalaq,Irfan Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于阿拉伯语情感分析的主动学习框架，通过比较人类标注和LLM辅助标注，证明LLM辅助的主动学习在减少标注成本的同时能实现竞争性或更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏高质量标注数据集而进展有限，主动学习在其他语言中已被证明能减少标注工作量，但在阿拉伯语中研究较少，且LLM在阿拉伯语标注中的性能尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出主动学习框架，评估LSTM、GRU、RNN等深度学习架构在三个基准数据集上的表现，比较人类标注和LLM辅助标注两种策略，评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3 Sonnet等五种LLM作为标注器。

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习取得了竞争性或更优的性能，例如在Hunger Station数据集上，LSTM模型使用GPT-4o生成的标签仅需450个样本就达到93%准确率，在MASAC数据集上DeepSeek Chat使用650个样本达到82%准确率，与人类标注相当。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的主动学习是阿拉伯语情感分析中减少标注成本的有效方法，能够实现与人类标注相当甚至更好的性能。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

*Janvijay Singh,Austin Xu,Yilun Zhou,Yefan Zhou,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了微调LLM作为评判模型在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来适应性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力，发现在数学领域中未来适应性最具挑战性，而向后兼容性相对容易实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调评判模型的标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题，特别是面对不断变化的生成器模型时的长期有效性。

Method: 在数学领域采用统一框架，研究不同训练和测试分布，使用三种基于SFT和DPO的微调算法和三个不同的基础模型。

Result: 实验表明未来适应性对大多数模型都具有挑战性，而向后兼容性相对容易，DPO训练的模型持续提升性能。持续学习在适应新旧响应分布变化方面表现更均衡。

Conclusion: 当前评判模型在问题泛化方面存在局限，这些发现为在不断变化的生成器环境中开发和部署评判模型提供了实践指导。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

The main objective of this paper is to create a domain-specific system for
Greek medical speech transcriptions. The ultimate goal is to assist healthcare
professionals by reducing the overload of manual documentation and improving
workflow efficiency. Towards this goal, we develop a system that combines
automatic speech recognition techniques with text correction model, allowing
better handling of domain-specific terminology and linguistic variations in

such as complex medical terminology and linguistic inconsistencies. Through
domain-specific fine-tuning, our system achieves more accurate and coherent
transcriptions, contributing to the development of practical language
technologies for the Greek healthcare sector.

TL;DR: 提出了MoRSD方法，通过选择高质量推理链进行蒸馏，提升小语言模型的推理能力，相比基线在7个数据集上平均提升4.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法低估了推理链质量的重要性，过度关注数据量，可能将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型。

Method: 提出模型导向的推理链选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，通过Rationale Difficulty(RD)指标衡量学生模型在给定推理链下生成正确答案的能力，选择高质量推理链进行蒸馏。

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上平均提升4.6%，使用更少但质量更高的推理链，通过控制准确性、多样性和难度来优化选择。

Conclusion: 少量高质量推理链比整个数据集更能提升学生模型的推理能力，MoRSD为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jackal是一个新颖的大规模文本到JQL基准测试，包含10万个自然语言请求与已验证的JQL查询配对，在包含20万个问题的实时Jira实例上执行。该基准测试揭示了当前最先进LLM在生成正确且可执行JQL查询方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业团队依赖JQL从Jira检索和过滤问题，但目前缺乏开放、真实世界、基于执行的将自然语言查询映射到JQL的基准测试。

Method: 创建了包含10万个自然语言请求与JQL查询配对的Jackal基准测试，每个JQL查询关联四种用户请求类型：长自然语言、短自然语言、语义相似和语义精确。在包含20万个问题的实时Jira实例上进行基于执行的评估。

Result: 在Jackal-5K子集上，最佳模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)在四种用户请求类型上的平均执行准确率仅为60.3%。性能在不同请求类型间差异显著：长自然语言(86.0%)、短自然语言(35.7%)、语义相似(22.7%)和语义精确(99.3%)。

Conclusion: Jackal暴露了当前最先进LLM的局限性，并为Jira企业数据领域的未来研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在关键应用场景中部署时，幻觉问题成为重要障碍。现有幻觉检测方法受限于知识覆盖范围或难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将LLM推理过程建模为随时间展开的认知旅程，通过隐藏层时域信号模拟人类在欺骗检测场景中的信号感知和辨别过程；2. 应用快速傅里叶变换将时域信号映射到频域构建频谱特征；3. 基于频谱特征设计幻觉检测算法。

Result: 频谱特征分析实验证明了该方法的有效性，HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现出更高的性能。

Conclusion: HSAD方法通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，克服了现有方法在知识覆盖和推理偏差检测方面的限制，为LLM幻觉检测提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: Timber是一种无需训练的方法，通过部分恢复Instruct模型到Base模型的权重来增强探索能力，同时保持利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练通常被认为是表面的，虽然提高了利用能力但限制了探索能力，需要解决这种权衡问题。

Method: 通过微调权重delta来部分恢复Instruct模型到Base模型的状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的实验表明，Timber能持续改进Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 研究从权重层面提供了后训练阶段的新见解，并提供了无需训练优化Instruct模型的实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Codebooks for Fast Thinking框架，通过训练时使用简洁的CoT草图学习离散策略先验，推理时使用少量连续思考向量实现策略级指导，无需生成显式推理token，显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理导向LLM依赖逐步生成显式token，需要大规模监督微调或强化学习，CoT技术虽然提升复杂推理任务性能但效率低下，推理轨迹长导致延迟和token使用量增加。

Method: 1. 训练时使用简洁CoT草图学习离散策略先验代码本；2. 推理时基于代码本蒸馏出的少量连续思考向量进行单次前向传播；3. 引入GainRouter轻量路由机制，自适应切换快速代码本引导推理和慢速显式推理。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，该方法在保持竞争性或更优准确性的同时，显著降低推理成本，抑制过度思考，减少不必要的token生成。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型提供了一条实现高效可控推理的实用路径，通过潜在代码本和自适应路由机制平衡推理性能与效率。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的扩散语言模型难以修正错误的标记，一旦生成就会固定不变。主要挑战在于识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: 提出重掩码机制，联合预测标记分布和每个标记的置信度分数，通过置信度决定哪些标记需要被重掩码以便后续重新采样。设计了包含监督微调和强化学习的训练流程。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了开源扩散语言模型中的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 重掩码机制显著提升了基于掩码的扩散语言模型的文本精炼能力，能够更灵活地识别和修正错误标记。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

Motivation: 虽然强化学习在提升复杂推理能力方面表现出色，但其在跨语言泛化方面与监督微调的比较尚未被探索，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 以Qwen2.5-3B-Base为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准（数学推理、常识推理、科学推理）上进行实验，并进行机制分析。

Result: RL在准确率和跨语言泛化能力上都显著优于SFT；在非英语数据上训练的RL模型整体性能和泛化能力更好，而SFT无此现象。

Conclusion: RL使模型具有更鲁棒的推理策略，为更公平有效的多语言推理提供了关键指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

Motivation: 解决LLM在英语和非英语语言间存在的性能差距问题，这种差距影响了多语言环境下的客户体验和操作可靠性。

Method: 使用批量对齐策略，在每个训练批次中利用语义等效的多语言数据来直接对齐模型在不同语言间的输出。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现、可扩展，并能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成，为行业提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment

TL;DR: TF-Bench是一个基于System F类型推断的基准测试，用于评估LLM的程序语义推理能力，通过去除语义无关的自然语言构建纯语义版本TF-Bench_pure，发现当前最先进LLM在此任务上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义而非仅利用自然语言与代码标记的表面关联。

Method: 引入TF-Bench基准，基于System F类型推断评估LLM推理能力，通过验证转换去除语义无关自然语言构建TF-Bench_pure变体，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理效果。

Result: 最先进LLM（Claude-3.7-sonnet）在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%准确率，显示当前模型在程序语义推理方面存在显著局限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在程序语义推理能力上存在关键限制，为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性；集成方法难以捕捉模态间的语义交互。需要同时解决这两种局限性。

Method: 使用四元数代数，四个正交基表示多个独立模态，通过Hamilton乘积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块。

Result: 在广泛实验中表现出最先进的性能、鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: M-Hyper方法成功实现了融合和独立模态表示的共存与协作，在MMKGC任务中取得了优异效果。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态推理中存在系统性瓶颈，研究发现整合而非感知是主要障碍，冗余或链式推理支持会损害性能，而两步提示方法可以恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理中关于额外模态是否真正提升性能的争议，通过受控评估框架分析模型内部机制，探究模态交互何时支持或破坏推理。

Method: 使用基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实在不同模态间的分布和逻辑组合方式，并研究注意力模式和两步提示方法。

Result: 额外模态仅在提供独立且充分的推理路径时提升性能；推理在三种方式下退化：弱模态拖累整体、冲突导致偏好偏差、联合信号整合失败；注意力模式无法编码事实有用性，但两步提示可恢复性能。

Conclusion: 整合是跨模态推理的主要瓶颈，而非感知能力；建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

Motivation: 语音集成到大型语言模型中虽然扩展了能力，但往往削弱了核心文本能力，限制了模型充分利用预训练文本知识的能力。

Method: 提出基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究编码器-适配器范式，分析语音微调对文本重要性分布的影响，并测试分层学习率调度和低秩适配两种缓解策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游语音问答性能。

Conclusion: 分析为所提缓解策略的有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RLHF框架主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型内部知识边界，加剧了"幻觉税"问题，需要解决长文本生成中的幻觉和事实性缺陷。

Method: 使用知识一致性强化学习框架，构建事实检查表指导在线强化学习，同时训练基于基础模型内部知识的自评估模块，通过双事实对齐机制联合优化事实召回和精确度。

Result: 实验结果表明KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著改善了事实性指标，有效缓解了模型幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KLCF提供了一种高效、轻量且可扩展的方法来提升LLM在长文本生成中的事实可靠性，无需依赖外部检索或繁重验证。

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出LoGo框架解决LLM个性化中的冷启动和偏见问题，通过结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的全局记忆，使用调解器模块协调两者差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM个性化中的两个关键挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史数据不足）和偏见问题（用户历史数据丰富但偏斜），这些问题源于无法建模用户间的集体知识

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的全局记忆，引入调解器模块解决本地与全局信号间的冲突

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo能持续提升个性化质量，既能为冷启动用户预热，又能减轻偏见预测

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了整合集体知识对增强LLM个性化的重要性

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多项选择题上表现不佳，尽管在其他情境下能展示正确知识。本文旨在探究这种知识-预测差距的机制并缓解它。

Method: 通过探测分析发现残差流中存在知识基和预测基两个重要基向量，提出KAPPA方法——一种无参数干预，通过投影变换隐藏状态来对齐预测坐标与知识坐标。

Result: 在Big-Bench-Hard和ARC-Challenge的二选一重构任务上，KAPPA显著提高了准确率并持续优于基线方法。跨数据集实验显示子空间具有一定泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对知识-预测差距的新几何理解，并提出了一种实用方法来更好地对齐模型行为与其潜在知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Method: 使用适配器模块构建Open-DeBias方法，通过少量训练数据微调适配器来缓解现有社会偏见和刻板印象偏见，并能泛化到未见偏见。

Result: 在BBQ数据集上，Open-DeBias相比BMBI方法在模糊子集上QA准确率提升近48%，在消歧子集上提升6%；在零样本迁移到韩语BBQ时达到84%准确率。

Conclusion: Open-DeBias展示了强大的鲁棒性、多语言能力和适用于通用开放领域偏见缓解的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

Motivation: 长文本推理在大型语言模型中的进展滞后，主要由于处理长文本的内在困难以及缺乏可靠的人工标注和可编程验证的奖励信号。

Method: SPELL框架集成三个循环角色：问题生成器从原始文档生成问题并附带参考答案；回答器学习基于文档回答问题；验证器评估回答器输出与参考答案的语义等价性，产生奖励信号指导持续训练。

Result: 在六个长文本基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SPELL在不同LLMs上一致提升性能，优于同等规模模型在大规模标注数据上的微调结果。

Conclusion: SPELL显著提升了强推理模型Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking的性能，展示了向更强大模型扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

TL;DR: Q-Tuning是一个统一的数据剪枝框架，通过在误差-不确定性平面上联合优化样本级和token级剪枝，显著提高监督微调的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法存在设计碎片化问题，要么在样本级别操作，要么在token级别操作，无法同时优化两个维度，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出误差-不确定性平面诊断框架，采用两阶段策略：先进行样本级筛选保留富含信息性误解或校准信号的样本，然后应用非对称token剪枝策略，仅从误解样本中修剪不重要的token。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中达到新的最优水平，在SmolLM2-1.7B上仅使用12.5%原始训练数据就比完整数据SFT基线平均提升38%。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是首个持续优于完整数据训练的动态剪枝方法，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用方案。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

Conclusion: DocPruner为构建存储高效的大规模VDR系统提供了一个稳健、灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

### [92] [Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23924)
*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出EOSER和ASS解码调度器以及CJ-GRPO强化学习算法，解决了掩码扩散语言模型在解码策略和强化学习方面的挑战，实现了更高效的推理和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型具有并行解码、灵活生成顺序等优势，但其解码策略和强化学习算法研究不足。直接迁移自回归模型的技术存在训练-推理不一致等问题。

Method: 提出EOS Early Rejection和Ascending Step-Size解码调度器，以及Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习算法。

Result: 在数学推理和规划基准测试中，使用LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型验证了所提方法的有效性，实现了竞争性性能且减少了解码步骤。

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS机制和CJ-GRPO算法为有效且高效地驯服掩码扩散语言模型提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLM在新信息出现时如何修正预测，发现LLM虽然对信息有响应但更新不一致或过于保守，置信度估计不如人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现预测和置信度应如何演变。

Method: 引入EVOLVECAST框架，评估LLM在训练截止后发布的新信息面前是否适当修正预测，以人类预测者作为参考基准。

Result: LLM对新信息有一定响应，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；语言化和基于logits的置信度估计均不如人类标准；模型普遍存在保守偏差。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的信念更新方法来解决LLM预测修正的问题。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Easy Turn，一个开源的模块化对话轮次检测模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息来预测四种对话状态，并发布了1145小时的训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对自然人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用模型，要么参数过大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量稀缺的全双工数据进行微调。

Method: 开发了开源模块化轮次检测模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息，预测四种对话状态：完成、未完成、反馈和等待。

Result: 在开源测试集上相比现有模型（TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2）实现了最先进的轮次检测准确率。

Conclusion: Easy Turn解决了现有轮次检测模型的局限性，提供了开源解决方案和数据集，将促进全双工人机交互的发展。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉基础口译(VGI)，通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，利用上下文视觉信息来改进机器口译的消歧和充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一的语言信号模态，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧的语境中表现受限。

Method: 开发原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头视觉输入，构建手工诊断语料库评估三种歧义类型。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善词汇消歧，在性别消歧上获得适度但不稳定的提升，对句法歧义无帮助。

Conclusion: 采用多模态方法是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

TL;DR: HiPO框架通过自适应推理控制，让LLM选择性决定何时进行详细推理（Think-on）和直接回答（Think-off），在保持准确性的同时显著减少token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维推理方法总是生成冗长的推理轨迹，导致token使用过多和推理成本过高，需要一种更高效的自适应推理方法。

Method: 结合混合数据管道（提供配对的Think-on和Think-off响应）与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免过度依赖详细推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能够显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了原则性方法，推动了推理导向LLM在资源敏感实际场景中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ByteSized32Refactored，一个重构的、模块化的文本游戏生成实现，通过创建GameBasic.py基础库和7个基类，将代码量从2万行减少到1万行，提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟交互式世界模型仍然是大型语言模型的核心挑战，需要更高效、可扩展的文本游戏生成框架。

Method: 重构ByteSized32代码结构，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象出7个基类作为可复用模块，实现模块化设计。

Result: 使用GPT-4o的实验显示，在未见过的场景中，重构后的文本游戏在4个评估维度中的2个维度上质量有所提升，但在另外2个维度上有所下降。

Conclusion: 基于基础库和模块化优化的可扩展代码结构不仅促进了LLM对环境规范的适应，还建立了一个支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

TL;DR: PaLRS是一种无需训练的大语言模型偏好对齐方法，通过提取残差流中的偏好信号生成轻量级转向向量，在推理时引导模型产生偏好行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法如RLHF和DPO需要精心策划的数据和大量参数优化，导致任务特定的模型且成本高昂。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，生成即插即用的转向向量，在推理时应用这些向量来引导模型行为。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中取得一致提升，同时保持基础通用性能，与DPO对齐模型相比性能更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS提供了一种有效、高效且灵活的偏好对齐替代方案，无需训练，仅需最少数据即可实现即插即用的对齐机制。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，其计算和环境成本日益受到关注，需要研究如何在保持性能的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人工评估，比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型在法语、印地语和卡纳达语翻译中的表现，并分析碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B模型BLEU得分最高但碳排放最大（每轮评估0.007-0.008kg CO2），蒸馏模型推理速度快4.5倍且BLEU下降很小，即使激进量化（INT4）也能保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力翻译质量，但在低资源设置中权衡更明显，建议将效率和可持续性纳入NLP评估框架。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

TL;DR: MCPMark是一个新的基准测试，旨在更全面、真实地评估MCP在复杂工作流中的使用，包含127个高质量任务，要求丰富的CRUD操作交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉真实世界工作流的复杂性。

Method: 创建了127个由领域专家和AI代理协作设计的高质量任务，每个任务包含精心策划的初始状态和自动验证脚本，使用最小化代理框架在工具调用循环中运行。

Result: 最佳模型gpt-5-medium仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型如claude-sonnet-4和o3低于30% pass@1和15% pass^4。LLMs平均需要16.2执行轮次和17.4工具调用。

Conclusion: MCPMark具有压力测试性质，显著超过了先前MCP基准的复杂度，突显了当前LLMs在处理复杂交互任务时的局限性。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了序列扩散语言模型（SDLM），通过下一代序列预测（NSP）统一了下一代标记和下一代块预测，能够自适应确定每个步骤的生成长度，同时保持KV缓存兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）具有理论效率优势，但受到固定长度解码和不兼容KV缓存的限制。块扩散虽然缓解了这些问题，但仍强制固定块大小且需要昂贵的训练。

Method: 基于NSP提出SDLM，可以在固定大小的掩码块内进行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列，从而保持KV缓存兼容性并提高对序列中不同不确定性和语义的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，SDLM仅使用350万个训练样本就能匹配或超越强大的自回归基线，同时实现比Qwen-2.5高2.1倍的吞吐量。SDLM-32B模型显示出更显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: SDLM展示了我们建模范式的强大可扩展性潜力，能够以最小成本改造预训练的自回归语言模型，实现高效的序列生成。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SparseD是一种针对扩散语言模型的新型稀疏注意力方法，通过预计算头部特定稀疏模式并在早期步骤使用全注意力，实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度下比FlashAttention快1.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源扩散语言模型存在高推理延迟问题，主要由于注意力机制的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中已有应用，但扩散模型中的注意力模式具有头部特异性、跨步骤相似性和早期步骤关键性等特点，使得传统稀疏方法不适用。

Method: SparseD方法：1）预计算头部特定的稀疏模式并跨步骤复用；2）在早期去噪步骤使用全注意力以保证生成质量，后期切换到稀疏注意力。

Result: 实验结果表明SparseD实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度和1024去噪步骤下，比FlashAttention快1.5倍。

Conclusion: SparseD为扩散语言模型在长上下文应用中的部署提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

TL;DR: ResFormer是一种新颖的神经网络架构，通过级联方法有效建模不同上下文长度，结合储层计算网络和Transformer，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时显著提升序列分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但存在二次方时间和内存复杂度的限制，难以处理长文本输入。现有方法在减少计算需求方面仍有挑战。

Method: 提出ResFormer架构，采用级联方法：使用带有非线性读出的储层计算网络捕获长期上下文依赖（线性时间复杂度），同时使用传统Transformer处理固定长度的短期句子依赖。

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上准确率比DeepSeek-Qwen和ModernBERT基线模型提升高达+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上也有持续增益，同时内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模广泛上下文信息方面展现出高效性和有效性，解决了Transformer处理长文本的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于transformer集成模型和大型语言模型的多语言情感分析方法，在缺乏标注数据的情况下，对多种语言进行情感分析，准确率达到86%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和互联网的发展，情感分析在营销、政治、客户服务等领域的重要性日益增长。但传统方法在处理外语情感分析时存在缺陷，特别是在缺乏标注数据的情况下。

Method: 使用多语言数据集，采用预训练情感分析模型的集成方法，包括bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment和XLM-R模型，构建transformer集成模型和大型语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在多语言情感分析任务中取得了超过86%的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了外语情感分析中缺乏标注数据的问题，为多语言情感分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

*Matteo Boffa,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出大规模约束生成（LSCG）问题，评估LLMs处理大量细粒度约束的能力，并开发Words Checker实例测试模型特性对性能的影响，同时提出FoCusNet模型来提升约束处理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在少量特定任务约束下的生成能力，而本文旨在探索LLMs能否解析大规模、细粒度的通用约束列表。

Method: 创建Words Checker实例评估模型特性（大小、家族）和引导技术（简单提示、思维链、Best of N）的影响；提出FoCusNet模型将原始约束列表解析为更小子集。

Result: 实验显示现有解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet能带来8-13%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: LLMs处理大规模约束的能力有限，但通过FoCusNet等专用模型可以显著改善约束解析性能。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

TL;DR: 提出了GEAR评估框架，用于评估大语言模型的溯因推理能力，通过一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标自动评分，无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注指令遵循和演绎推理，但大语言模型能否发现新知识以及如何评估这种能力仍是核心问题。

Method: 引入GEAR评估范式，包含三个评分指标：一致性（假设能解释观察）、泛化性（假设能对未见输入做出预测）、多样性（假设集覆盖不同预测模式）。

Result: 在4个溯因推理基准测试的1500个问题上评估了9个大语言模型，生成了超过50,000个候选假设，揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的模型差异。

Conclusion: GEAR提供了一个原则性框架来评估溯因推理，并为大语言模型提供无需标注的训练信号，帮助生成更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，这些偏见在现实应用中可能有害。传统方法构建多样化测试句子成本高昂，需要领域专家和众包。

Method: 使用大型语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，通过最小化规范生成高质量测试用例。

Result: 实验表明，依赖LLM可以提供高语言变异性和多样性的测试句子，相比基础提示方法提供更好的测试覆盖，即使对于先前未见过的偏见也有效。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架能够高效生成高质量偏见测试用例，为情感分析模型的偏见检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究如何让大语言模型实现泛化的道德推理，提出了基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，通过上下文信息连接道德基础与推理目标，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在道德推理方面面临泛化挑战，因为模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德推理需要在语用层面运作，两者存在根本差异。

Method: 提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，利用每一步的上下文信息来弥合语用鸿沟，引导LLMs将道德基础与道德推理目标相连接。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于道德基础理论的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Result: 在Jericho文本游戏基准测试中，GLoW实现了LLM方法的最新最先进性能，与最先进的基于RL的方法相比，在达到相当性能的同时，所需环境交互量减少了100-800倍。

Conclusion: GLoW框架通过双尺度世界模型和多路径优势反射机制，有效解决了LLM智能体在硬探索任务中的挑战，显著减少了所需的环境交互量。

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in
"hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration.
We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models,
maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global
scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a
Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress
signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration,
we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves
a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to
state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance
while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions
from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world
significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点准确率，但忽略了提示的改写不变性和搜索稳定性，导致小的语义保持改写会引起大的性能波动。

Method: 提出TARE框架：包含基于采样的对抗性搜索（内部）和鲁棒选择（外部），以及ATARE变体学习各向异性权重来调整语义邻域半径。

Result: 在多样化任务上评估，TARE方法在保持准确率的同时显著提高了提示的改写鲁棒性，优于仅关注准确率的提示搜索方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本锐度差距，TARE框架能够生成在语义改写下保持性能稳定的提示，同时保持计算实用性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型比较主要关注宏观统计指标，如任务准确率或推理长度，但不同模型是否以不同方式推理仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型比较两个LRM的推理轨迹，用文字描述其区别特征，然后基于这些特征在LRM输出中的经验分布来预测推理轨迹的来源模型。

Result: 在数学、科学和编程任务上比较12个开源LRM，LOT能识别系统性推理差异，在区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的LRM时达到80-100%的准确率。案例研究表明，将较小Qwen3模型的推理风格与最大Qwen3对齐，可在GPQA上提升准确率3.3-5.7%。

Conclusion: LOT提供了一种量化且可解释的方法来比较LRM的推理过程，揭示了模型间的系统性差异，并展示了推理风格对齐对性能的积极影响。

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和上下文学习(ICL)机制分析中的两种主导视角：注意力头的组件级分析和TR-TL分解的整体视角，为LLM如何执行ICL提供统一解释。

Method: 使用TSLA框架识别TR和TL专用注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融实验、输入扰动和几何分析隐藏状态等方法验证其作用。

Result: 发现TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签以促进预测，两者独立且有效捕获ICL的TR和TL组件。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM在不同任务和设置中执行ICL提供了统一且可解释的机制描述，能够调和先前关于ICL机制的研究发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

Motivation: 现有方法从模型输出或隐藏状态提取任务向量存在繁琐不透明的问题，且很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。

Method: 直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，并系统分析任务向量在Transformer中的传播机制，包括注意力头OV电路的作用和线性传播特性。

Result: LTVs在准确性上优于提取的任务向量，具有更好的灵活性，能在任意层、位置甚至ICL提示下有效工作。分析发现任务向量主要通过少量关键注意力头发挥作用，且传播过程基本是线性的。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解ICL的机制基础提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在现实应用中效果有限，主要受限于训练数据稀缺和复杂任务的长尾知识需求。

Method: 首先通过监督微调预热模型，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。RAG-GUI设计为模型无关的通用插件，可增强任何基于VLM的代理。

Result: 在三个不同任务上的评估显示，RAG-GUI始终优于基线代理，在两个模型尺寸上比其他推理基线提升2.6%到13.3%。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI展示了强大的泛化能力和实用的即插即用能力，适用于现实世界场景。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗高风险应用中的使用增加，传统准确率指标无法充分捕捉问题特征和提供主题特定见解，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)框架，收集80个不同LLM在1,100个USMLE对齐问题上的响应，为每个主题建立单维双参数逻辑IRT模型，联合估计模型潜在能力、问题难度和区分度。

Result: 发现LLM具有独特的"尖峰"能力分布，GPT-5在11个领域中的8个表现最佳，但在社会科学和通信领域被Claude-3-opus超越；识别出有缺陷的问题；建立了实用的决策支持框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM在医疗保健中的安全、有效和可信部署建立了稳健的心理测量学基础方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM直接生成偏好列表的方法虽然有效但存在局限性：决策过程不透明、限制个性化、加剧流行度偏见，需要更透明和可解释的用户偏好建模方法

Method: PET框架应用logit-probing和生成式分类技术，在稳定的可解释偏好簇格上推断用户的动态概率分布

Conclusion: PET将用户画像从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明的分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平道路

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Zihan Dong,Jonathan Wang,Yue Yu,Joyce C. Ho,Linjun Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AceSearcher是一个协作自玩框架，通过训练单一LLM在分解者和解决者两个角色间切换，提升复杂推理任务的检索和推理能力，无需中间标注，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM在复杂推理任务中存在多跳检索效率低和推理能力有限的问题，需要改进多步骤推理和检索集成。

Method: 提出协作自玩框架，训练单一LLM交替扮演分解者（分解复杂查询）和解决者（整合检索上下文生成答案），结合监督微调和强化学习微调。

Result: 在10个数据集的3个推理密集型任务上，平均精确匹配提升7.6%；32B模型在文档级金融推理任务中性能媲美DeepSeek-V3，但参数量不到其5%；小规模模型（1.5B/8B）性能优于参数量9倍大的现有模型。

Conclusion: AceSearcher在复杂推理任务中展现出卓越的效率和效果，证明了协作自玩框架的有效性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published
at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言置信度作为轻量级、人类对齐的LLM不确定性估计方法，通过构建首个大规模对冲表达数据集和轻量级映射器，系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现，并提出了改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM应用于高风险场景时，过度自信的回答会误导用户。现有置信度估计方法存在实际障碍：logits通常隐藏、多重采样计算成本高、数值化不确定性表达不符合自然沟通方式。

Method: 1) 发布首个多样化、大规模的对冲表达数据集；2) 提出轻量级映射器将对冲表达转换为置信度分数；3) 系统研究现代LLM在语言置信度方面的表现；4) 引入微调框架提升语言置信度可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示方法能达到竞争性的校准和区分能力。微调框架进一步提高了语言置信度的可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度是一种可扩展、高效且人类对齐的LLM不确定性估计方法，值得进一步探索这一有前景但研究不足的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个避免训练数据污染的评估框架，通过算法问题生成来公平评估语言模型的推理能力，而非记忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试存在训练数据污染问题，无法区分模型是在真正推理还是仅仅回忆答案。

Method: 使用算法问题生成创建数学基础的问题，覆盖44个算法任务共117个变体，分为三个难度级别，每个任务从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间生成问题。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型，发现所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，性能随问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级而急剧下降。在困难套件中，Gemini-2.5-pro、Llama-3.3-70B和Qwen2.5-72B的平均准确率分别为56.38%、26.91%和33.60%。

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现不佳，性能严重依赖工具使用，表明当前模型在真正推理能力方面仍有显著局限。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

### [122] [ScenarioBench: Trace-Grounded Compliance Evaluation for Text-to-SQL and RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24212)
*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成在合规场景下的基准测试工具，包含决策准确性、追踪质量、检索效果等多维度评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL或KILT/RAG基准测试缺乏将决策与条款级证据严格关联的机制，无法有效评估系统在合规场景下的解释质量。

Method: 通过YAML场景文件构建评估框架，包含不可见的黄金标准包、最小见证追踪、管辖条款集和规范SQL，要求系统使用相同政策规范中的条款ID来证明输出。

Result: 提供了端到端的评分系统，能够同时评估系统决策内容和推理过程，并引入标准化场景难度指数来综合考量检索难度和时间因素。

Conclusion: ScenarioBench通过严格的证据基础和不可见规则，将评估重点转向在明确时间预算下的解释质量，为合规场景下的AI系统评估提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Result: MoVa的提示策略在多个领域和框架中优于微调模型，能够促进对人类和机器通信的细粒度解释。

Conclusion: MoVa的数据和方法有助于机器行为对齐，为道德价值观分析提供了有效的工具和资源。

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the
CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an
in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the
game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness
and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of
the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without
tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using
vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the
second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

TL;DR: MetaTuner是一个新颖框架，通过联合集成提示优化和微调来提升大语言模型性能，利用共享编码层实现知识共享，并通过监督正则化损失有效训练离散和连续优化组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地研究提示优化和微调这两种提升LLM性能的方法，而它们之间的协同潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入MetaTuner框架，包含两个神经网络分别生成提示和参数，共享底层编码层以实现知识共享。设计监督正则化损失来有效训练离散提示优化和连续参数微调组件。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MetaTuner成功展示了提示优化和微调的协同效应，为LLM训练提供了更有效的集成方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

Motivation: 当前的多模态检索增强生成系统评估未能系统考虑查询难度和模糊性，导致评估不全面。

Method: 提出MRAG-Suite平台，整合多个多模态基准测试，引入基于难度和模糊性的过滤策略，并开发MM-RAGChecker诊断工具进行声明级分析。

TL;DR: SimuHome是一个基于Matter协议的智能家居模拟环境，用于开发和评估LLM智能体在复杂智能家居任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能家居环境中LLM智能体面临的潜在用户意图理解、时间依赖性、设备约束等挑战，以及缺乏真实模拟环境和评估基准的问题。

Method: 开发基于Matter协议的SimuHome模拟器，提供时间加速的智能设备模拟、API调用支持和环境变量变化反馈，并构建包含600个场景的12类用户查询基准。

Result: 在11个智能体的评估中，即使是表现最好的GPT-4.1模型，在复杂任务上的成功率仅为54%，尤其是在潜在意图推理、状态验证和时间调度方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 智能家居智能体需要能够通过工具可靠验证当前状态并协调时间相关动作的方法，现有模型在复杂智能家居任务中仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的嵌入方法通常采用编码器范式，将LLM视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其核心的生成能力。

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，通过生成软标记序列并在对比目标下优化，捕捉编码器方法常忽略的潜在概念和隐式语义。采用迭代对比优化目标指导优化过程。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中表现优于现有LLM嵌入基线，并展现出测试时扩展特性：推理时生成更多标记能持续提升嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新范式。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型因其迭代和并行生成机制，存在与自回归LLMs根本不同的安全漏洞，特别是在越狱攻击方面需要深入研究。

Method: 提出DiffuGuard防御框架，采用双阶段方法：随机退火重掩码动态引入可控随机性缓解贪婪选择偏差，块级审计修复利用内部模型表示进行自主风险检测和引导校正。

Result: 在四个dLLMs上的实验表明，DiffuGuard对六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持了模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: 当前解码策略构成显著漏洞，但dLLMs具有实质性内在安全潜力，DiffuGuard能够有效解锁这种潜力，提供训练免费的防御解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的两种方式（内在表达与提示引导表达）的底层机制差异，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法进行机制分析：(1) 价值向量 - 从残差流中提取代表价值机制的特征方向；(2) 价值神经元 - 识别MLP中参与价值表达的神经元。

Result: 发现内在和提示引导价值机制部分共享诱导价值表达的关键组件，但也拥有独特元素，导致不同的可操控性（提示引导 > 内在）和响应多样性（内在 > 提示引导）。

Conclusion: 内在机制独特组件促进词汇多样性，而提示引导机制独特组件主要强化指令遵循，甚至在越狱等远程任务中也发挥作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

*Sungkyun Kim,Jaemin Kim,Dogyung Yoon,Jiho Shin,Junyeol Lee,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification(SV)方法，通过动态预测推测准确率并调整验证长度来提升大语言模型推理效率，相比传统推测解码可提升1.4倍性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推测准确率低时，拒绝令牌的开销会抵消其收益，特别是在大批量设置下效率受限。

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的辅助模型来估计草稿模型与目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度以最大化吞吐量。

Result: 在9种模型组合和批量大小4-80的广泛实验中，SV始终优于传统推测解码和目标模型标准解码，在大批量设置下平均加速1.4倍，最高提升2倍。

Conclusion: SV方法具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和实用性，无需修改现有模型即可显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

*Mengyu Bu,Shaolei Zhang,Zhongjun He,Hua Wu,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignX是一个两阶段的表示级框架，通过多语言语义对齐和指令微调来提升预训练大语言模型的多语言性能，缩小不同语言间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主流语言上的性能和跨语言对齐往往较差，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法存在对齐不精确和知识转移不理想的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLM的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提升了LLM的多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力，使多语言表示更加接近并改善了跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: AlignX框架有效解决了多语言LLM在非主流语言上的性能差距问题，通过表示级对齐和指令微调实现了更好的跨语言能力。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

### [136] [Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24356)
*Matthew Theodore Roque,Dan John Velasco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究在数据受限环境下语言模型预训练的数据调度策略，探讨文本简化作为数据增强和复杂度排序对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大数据集预训练，但在数据受限情况下，训练数据顺序和包含同一文本的替代版本的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用平行语料库（人工撰写段落与LLM简化版本），测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、低到高复杂度、高到低、交错排列，通过微调和零样本任务评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复暴露基线能提升微调和零样本性能；小模型受益于低到高复杂度排序，大模型在交错排序下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，文本简化作为数据增强有效，最优数据调度策略取决于模型规模。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

### [137] [Reinforcement Mid-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24375)
*Yijun Tian,Shaoyu Chen,Zhichao Xu,Yawei Wang,Jinhe Bi,Peng Han,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了强化中训练(RMT)作为大语言模型开发的新阶段，通过动态token预算、课程自适应采样和双重训练策略，显著提升模型性能并减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型开发通常分为预训练和后训练两个阶段，但缺乏中间阶段来进一步提升性能。本文指出需要引入强化中训练阶段以获得更强的性能增益。

Method: 提出RMT框架，包含三个创新组件：1) 动态token预算机制限制不必要的推理步骤；2) 课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；3) 结合强化学习和下一token预测的双重训练策略。

Result: 实验表明RMT优于现有方法，在语言建模中性能提升高达+64.91%，同时推理长度减少到仅21%。强化中训练获得的检查点还能使后续后训练在数学领域提升+18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中训练是提升大语言模型性能的有效中间阶段，RMT框架通过解决训练效率、token熵分布不平衡和token信息利用不足等挑战，实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了HarmMetric Eval基准，用于系统评估LLM安全性的度量标准和评判器，发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐研究缺乏系统基准来评估各种有害性度量和评判器的质量与有效性，这影响了越狱攻击效果报告的可信度。

Method: 构建包含代表性有害提示及多样化模型响应的高质量数据集，设计灵活的评分机制，支持对度量和评判器进行整体和细粒度评估。

Result: 实验发现传统指标METEOR和ROUGE-1在评估模型响应有害性方面优于基于LLM的评判器，挑战了LLM在此领域的优越性认知。

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval为LLM安全性评估提供了可靠基准，揭示了传统指标在有害性评估中的意外优势，对LLM安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

TL;DR: LLaDA-MoE是一个基于混合专家架构的大语言扩散模型，在20T token上从头训练，通过仅激活1.4B参数实现高效推理，性能超越之前的扩散语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在掩码扩散语言模型中集成稀疏MoE架构，在保持高效推理的同时发挥MoE优势，为扩散语言模型开辟新的研究方向。

Method: 采用混合专家架构，总参数容量为7B但推理时仅激活1.4B参数，在约20T token上从头训练，并进行指令调优。

Result: 在多个基准测试中超越了LLaDA、LLaDA 1.5和Dream等扩散语言模型，LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct在知识理解、代码生成、数学推理等任务上表现与Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct相当。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE架构与扩散语言模型的结合在高效推理下仍能发挥MoE优势，为扩散语言模型的进一步探索提供了充足空间。

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE
models are available at Huggingface.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Agentar-Scale-SQL是一个新颖的Text-to-SQL框架，通过协调的测试时缩放策略，在BIRD基准测试中达到81.67%的执行准确率，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的Text-to-SQL方法在BIRD等挑战性基准测试中仍显著落后于人类专家，现有方法缺乏协调策略且忽视了模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 采用协调的测试时缩放策略，结合三个不同视角：通过RL增强的内在推理进行内部缩放、通过迭代精化进行顺序缩放、使用多样化合成和锦标赛选择进行并行缩放。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中达到81.67%的执行准确率，在官方排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: Agentar-Scale-SQL为达到人类水平性能提供了有效路径，是一个易于适应新数据库和更强大语言模型的通用框架。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive
experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD
benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking
first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward
human-level performance.

TL;DR: MultiSpider 2.0是一个多语言Text-to-SQL基准测试，扩展了Spider 2.0到8种语言，揭示了当前LLM在多语言SQL生成上的显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数Text-to-SQL基准测试都是英语的，限制了多语言进展，需要评估模型在不同语言和方言下的表现。

Method: 扩展Spider 2.0到8种语言（英、德、法、西、葡、日、中、越），保持结构复杂性同时增加语言变异性。

Result: 最先进的LLM仅达到4%的执行准确率，而协作语言代理方法将准确率提升到15%，相比MultiSpider 1.0的60%仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 存在显著的多语言差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以适应实际企业部署需求。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 提出了CDT框架，从认知、领域、任务三个维度全面评估大语言模型能力，并应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择，实验显示能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往关注孤立能力，缺乏全面评估大语言模型能力的整体框架，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT)框架，结合Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论，从三个维度定义模型能力，应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。

Result: 能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，在数据选择实验中，通用和特定基准测试分别达到44.3和45.4分，比基线提高1.6和2.2分。

Conclusion: CDT框架在模型能力评估和数据选择方面具有有效性和实用性，为全面评估大语言模型提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are

TL;DR: 本文综述了替代Next Token Prediction(NTP)的五大方法家族，旨在解决LLMs在长期规划、错误累积和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP范式虽然推动了LLMs的成功，但也导致了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等持久性问题，因此需要探索替代方案。

Method: 将替代方法分为五类：多标记预测、先规划后生成、潜在推理、连续生成方法、非Transformer架构。

Result: 建立了替代NTP方法的分类体系，为研究超越标记级生成限制的新模型提供了指导框架。

Conclusion: 通过系统分类替代NTP的方法，为开发解决现有LLMs局限性的变革性NLP模型提供了研究路线图。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏见方法评估主要关注与偏见无关的一般语言理解任务，而文化常识与社会偏见都源于社会规范和价值观，但去偏见方法对文化常识的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出SOBACO基准测试，以统一格式评估日语LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，并评估多种去偏见方法对文化常识的影响。

Result: 去偏见方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，最高可达75%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发考虑与文化常识权衡的去偏见方法，以提高LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统语音识别评估指标（如词错误率）受高频词主导，掩盖了在罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇上的重要错误差异，需要更精细的错误分析方法。

Method: 开发了一种结合动态规划和束搜索评分的新型对齐算法，相比传统文本对齐方法能提供更准确的个体错误对齐。

Result: 该方法能够实现更可靠的错误分析，算法已通过PyPI发布。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐算法为语音识别系统提供了更精细的错误分析能力，有助于识别和解决在语义重要词汇上的错误。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRPO-MA通过每个思维过程生成多个答案来改进GRPO算法，解决了梯度耦合、稀疏奖励和优势估计不稳定等问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对GRPO算法存在的三个挑战：思维与答案的梯度耦合、有限并行采样导致的稀疏奖励信号、以及不稳定的优势估计，需要开发更鲁棒高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，利用每个思维过程生成多个答案，理论上证明随着每个思维生成的答案数量增加，思维优势的方差会减小，从而获得更稳定和高效的优化。

Result: 梯度分析证实GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，在数学、代码和多样化多模态任务上的实验表明，GRPO-MA显著提升了性能和训练效率。消融研究显示增加每个思维的答案数量能持续改善模型性能。

Conclusion: GRPO-MA是一个简单但理论上有依据的方法，通过多答案生成机制有效解决了GRPO的关键挑战，为CoT推理训练提供了更鲁棒和高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

TL;DR: SUIT方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，在保持高编辑效率的同时显著改善了知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在修改MLP层时没有对关键向量和值向量施加约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动。

Method: 提出子空间知识编辑(SUIT)方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验结果表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效率的同时显著改善了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑的关键子空间，进一步分析为该方法提供了额外验证。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估缺乏对终端用户现实生活的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域需要超越人工或模拟任务，反映社区日常需求、文化实践和细微背景。

Method: 与民间组织和社区成员共同创建社区驱动评估流程，通过社区反馈指导评估内容、基准构建和输出评分，实现可扩展的自动化基准测试。

Result: 展示了该方法在印度健康领域的应用，分析了当前多语言LLM如何处理细微的社区健康查询。

Conclusion: Samiksha为LLM评估提供了情境基础和包容性的可扩展路径，强调了社区参与在评估过程中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准来增强医学LLMs的自适应思考能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学LLMs无论问题难易都进行冗长推理，导致实际应用中的推理成本增加，需要实现自适应思考能力。

Method: 生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度，对简单问题惩罚长推理路径，对复杂问题鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公共医学QA基准测试中，平均实现6.4倍的推理长度减少，性能仅有最小程度的下降，并自发发展出"不思考"和"思考"两种推理模式。

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med有效提升了医学LLMs的自适应思考能力，在性能和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

<details>

Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在测试因果假设方面存在局限，需要新的计算框架来研究阅读障碍的潜在机制

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并针对性消融这些单元，同时保持随机单元不变

Result: 针对性消融词汇处理单元导致阅读任务选择性受损，而一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，模型复制了阅读障碍者的语音缺陷特征

Conclusion: 该建模结果复制了阅读障碍的关键特征，为研究阅读障碍建立了一个计算框架

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多语言ASR有所进展，但代码转换（混合语言）在日常语音中常见却研究不足，需要专门评估框架。

Method: 构建HiKE基准测试框架，包含高质量韩英代码转换数据、借词标签和分层CS级别标注（词、短语、句子级别）。

Result: 评估显示大多数多语言ASR模型在代码转换ASR上表现不佳，但通过CS数据微调可以显著提升性能。

Conclusion: HiKE为韩英代码转换研究提供了首个可访问的评估框架，证明CS数据微调能有效提升多语言ASR的代码转换处理能力。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

Motivation: 科学文献中宣传性语言日益增多，可能影响证据的客观评估、阻碍研究发展并损害科学信任，因此需要自动检测这种夸张或主观的语言。

Method: 制定正式的标注指南识别夸张语言，在NIH基金申请语料库上进行人工标注，然后评估传统文本分类器和语言模型在此任务上的性能。

Result: 实验表明，正式化标注指南有助于可靠地标注候选夸张形容词，使用标注数据集训练机器学习模型可获得有希望的结果，但任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间意识。

Conclusion: 这是首次将夸张宣传语言检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究，展示了自动检测科学文献中夸张语言的可行性，但需要进一步解决语言复杂性和领域知识需求。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数并破坏预训练-微调流程，导致收敛缓慢和加速困难。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2有效解决了长序列处理的计算瓶颈，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，为研究社区提供了可复现的实现方案。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了unPact框架，通过提示归因和贡献追踪来解释大语言模型中的遗忘机制，发现现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识仍可通过关键词强调恢复，要么因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型遗忘方法的效果存在争议，一方面被'遗忘'的知识可通过微调恢复，另一方面遗忘可能引发灾难性遗忘。由于难以追踪LLMs复杂架构中的知识，对遗忘机制的解释性分析稀缺。

Method: 提出unPact框架，通过量化提示中每个标记对输出的影响，实现遗忘前后的比较分析。在六种主流遗忘方法、三种LLMs和三个基准测试上进行评估。

Result: 发现：(1)遗忘通过破坏对提示关键词的关注而看似有效；(2)大部分知识并未真正擦除，仅通过强调关键词即可恢复；(3)灾难性遗忘源于对所有标记的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么不足（知识可通过关键词强调恢复），要么过于破坏性（因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评分方法存在评分不稳定、校准差、分数压缩到高分区间和频繁平局等系统性问题，需要更可靠的评分方法。

Method: 提出了三种潜在评分方法：(1)基于整数评分的概率加权分数，(2)验证式的是/否概率，(3)在评分位置训练的线性探针模型。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法匹配或超越了标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面有持续提升。概率加权分数在单评分相关性方面表现最强，而探针方法在输出logits校准不佳时能恢复有用信号。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为无参考评估提供了确定性和更具区分度的信号，可以改进Best-of-N选择、多教师蒸馏和路由等选择和训练方法。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数化记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库，但都无法捕捉人类认知中推理与记忆的流畅交织。

Method: MemGen框架包含记忆触发器（监控代理推理状态决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，MemGen超越领先的外部记忆系统ExpeL和AWM达38.22%，超过GRPO达13.44%，并表现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemGen无需显式监督就能自发演化出类人记忆能力（规划记忆、程序记忆和工作记忆），表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹。

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

Result: 仅从100个种子问题开始，Socratic-Solver-8B在7个数学推理基准上平均比先前数据合成方法提升20.2个百分点；Socratic-Generator-32B的合成数据使学生LLM在这些基准上超越其他SOTA商业LLM。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero通过完全自主的闭环系统生成自我改进的课程，显著提升了LLM在推理任务上的性能，证明了数据合成方法的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,

attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

TL;DR: LatentEvolve是一个自进化的潜在测试时缩放框架，受互补学习系统理论启发，通过白天缩放和夜间缩放两个进化组件，让LLM学习如何更有效地进行测试时计算缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法大多是独立的，LLM尚未学会如何逐步更有效地进行缩放。目标是让LLM学习"如何缩放测试时计算"。

Method: 受人类大脑互补学习系统启发，包含两个进化组件：白天缩放（快速检索历史潜在表示来指导当前推理）和夜间缩放（整合过去潜在优化，类似人脑睡眠时的经验巩固）。

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve比最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）性能提升高达13.33%，并展现出卓越的跨领域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: 白天和夜间过程的交替促进了LLM测试时缩放的快速和慢速进化，以完全无监督的方式模拟人类认知动态。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过引入LLM中常见的三种错误类型到偏好优化中，确保负样本比正样本更具错误性，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法使用正负样本对进行偏好优化，但由于模型评分或生成能力有限，训练过程中正负样本质量可能趋于相似，导致偏好学习优化困难。

Method: 引入SeaPO方法，利用LLM中常见的三种错误类型，在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更具错误性，并通过基于偏好的训练来减少这些错误。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提升了整体模型性能，特别是在真实性方面观察到5-10个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型可提升相关任务性能，而混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升，大多数任务显示稳定改进，少数任务有显著增益。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本相似度指标如BLEU和BERT无法有效评估组装指令的时空合理性，需要开发能更好反映构建过程时空特性的评估方法。

Method: 开发了基于树结构的自动评估指标，应用于缝纫指令领域，并与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分进行相关性分析。

Result: 新指标与人工错误计数和人类质量评分的相关性优于传统指标，且在针对文本相似度指标设计的对抗样本上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的树基评估指标在评估缝纫指令的时空合理性方面优于传统文本相似度指标，具有更好的相关性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

TL;DR: KnowGuard提出了一种"调查后再弃权"的新范式，通过系统性的知识图谱探索来改进临床决策中的弃权机制，在诊断准确性和交互效率方面都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医学场景中缺乏有效的弃权机制，经常在信息不足时给出过度自信的回答，这可能导致有害的误诊。传统弃权方法仅依赖模型自评估，缺乏系统性策略来识别知识边界。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1)证据发现阶段通过图谱扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段使用多因素对证据进行排序，根据患者上下文和对话历史调整探索策略。

Result: KnowGuard在开放式多轮临床基准测试中表现优异，诊断准确率提高3.93%，同时平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的"调查后再弃权"范式通过系统性知识图谱探索有效解决了LLMs在医学决策中的弃权问题，显著提升了诊断准确性和交互效率。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiaCDM是首个在对话场景中进行认知诊断的模型，通过教育理论中的IRE框架和基于图的编码方法，解决了传统认知诊断模型在处理非结构化对话时的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型难以处理动态、非结构化的师生对话，且难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义。

Method: 采用教育理论中的IRE（发起-回应-评估）框架设计诊断框架，并开发了基于图的编码方法，整合教师问题和相关知识组件以精确捕捉关键信息。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，并增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: DiaCDM为教师评估学生认知状态提供了强大工具，是对话场景中认知诊断的首个探索。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

### [165] [SemShareKV: Efficient KVCache Sharing for Semantically Similar Prompts via Token-Level LSH Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24832)
*Xinye Zhao,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV是一个基于语义相似性的KV缓存共享和压缩框架，通过模糊令牌匹配和位置信息保留来加速LLM推理，在保持输出质量的同时显著减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，推理过程中KV缓存的内存占用成为显著瓶颈。现有方法主要关注单个提示内的压缩或跨提示的精确匹配，但在语义相似但词汇不同的场景中效果有限。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希(LSH)进行令牌嵌入的模糊匹配，结合旋转位置嵌入(RoPE)更好地保留位置信息，选择性重用参考提示的KV缓存。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上，5k令牌输入时实现最高6.25倍加速和42% GPU内存降低，质量退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 语义感知的缓存共享在高效LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，在医学编码任务中仅达到45.9%准确率，需要专门的方法来提升专业领域性能。

Method: 分析四个专业领域的错误模式，发现错误遵循分层结构：知识层错误（58.4%）、推理层错误（39.6%）和复杂度层错误（2.0%）。基于此开发三阶段纠正框架，按层次重要性处理错误。

Result: 在医学转录（4,921例）、法律文件分类（1,000例）、政治偏见检测（645例）和法律推理（1,000例）任务中均显示一致改进。跨五个LLM架构验证显示平均提升11.2个百分点（p < 0.001）。

Conclusion: 系统性错误分析可以指导专业领域的有效AI增强策略，特别适用于中等基线任务，同时强调理解框架边界对于优化部署的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在心理健康危机检测和响应方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs在处理明确危机披露时表现一致可靠，但在处理间接风险信号时存在系统性弱点，且存在不当或有害响应的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT和Llama等LLMs在情感支持和心理健康等高风险场景中的广泛应用，需要了解它们安全检测和响应急性心理健康危机的能力，但目前缺乏统一的危机分类法、标注基准和基于临床最佳实践的实证评估。

Method: 引入统一的六个临床知情心理健康危机分类法，策划多样化评估数据集，建立专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三种最先进LLMs进行危机类型分类和安全响应生成能力基准测试。

Result: LLMs在处理明确危机披露时高度一致且总体可靠，但相当比例的响应被评为不当或有害，开源模型比商业模型失败率更高。系统弱点包括处理间接风险信号能力不足、依赖公式化默认回复、与用户情境频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要加强LLM部署中的安全防护措施、改进危机检测和情境感知干预。该研究的分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动心理健康支持的持续研究和负责任创新奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语中的普遍特征，但由于其语境敏感性，大规模分析一直受限于需要手动标注。本研究旨在探索大语言模型在完整文本中自动识别隐喻的潜力。

Method: 比较了三种方法：(1)检索增强生成(RAG)，提供代码书让模型基于规则和示例进行标注；(2)提示工程，设计特定任务的文字指令；(3)微调，在人工编码文本上训练模型。在提示工程中还测试了零样本、少样本和思维链策略。

Result: 最先进的闭源大语言模型能达到高准确率，微调方法的中位F1分数为0.79。人类与模型输出的差异大多是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中已知的灰色区域和概念挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，以增强问题解决能力，而无需训练特殊标记。

Method: 通过实验确定有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，分析模型在不同训练阶段如何利用扩展计算空间，并使用注意力图分析空间内的计算动态。

Result: 在1.7B到32B模型上的开放域QA和数学任务实验显示，在最终'Answer:'标记前插入填充标记最有效，小模型受益最大（SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct提升12.372个百分点）。

Conclusion: 填充标记空间确实作为额外计算容量发挥作用，而非冗余输入，注意力图显示这些空间延续原始注意力机制并聚焦于问题或选项，表明其进行有意义的问题解决计算。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 创建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含西班牙官方公报文档的简明摘要；对中等规模LLM进行微调，并与零样本通用模型进行比较。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专业化模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 针对特定领域微调的LLM在法律文档摘要任务上表现优异，证明了领域专业化的重要性。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of

Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但其复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不明确，需要评估方法。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-gram与transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对，无需监督训练或阈值调整。

Result: 在学术论文上达到97.5%准确率，跨域评估94.5%，相比参数基线减少91.8%训练时间和59%内存使用。提示策略比模型大小对风格保真度影响更大，few-shot提示比zero-shot高23.5倍风格匹配准确率。

Conclusion: 风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为未来作者建模、检测和身份条件生成建立了可复现基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

Method: 通过设计指标精心筛选和重采样开源数据集，使用约2T高质量token进行预训练，再通过4.2T token重采样数据训练，结合标准后训练流程开发MobileLLM-R1系列模型。

Result: MobileLLM-R1-950M在AIME测试中获得15.5分，远超OLMo-2-1.48B（0.6分）和SmolLM-2-1.7B（0.3分）。仅使用Qwen3 11.7%的训练数据量，但在多个推理基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3-0.6B。

Conclusion: 推理能力的涌现不依赖于海量训练数据，高质量数据筛选比数据规模更重要。该研究为开发高效推理模型提供了新方向，并开源了完整训练方案和模型。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

TL;DR: MAQuE是最大的医疗多轮问答自动评估基准，包含3000个模拟患者代理，评估AI医生的诊断准确性、沟通能力和患者体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能，但忽视了优秀医生应具备的共情、耐心、清晰沟通等关键品质，需要全面评估医疗问答能力。

Method: 构建包含3000个模拟患者代理的基准，这些代理具有多样化语言模式、认知限制、情绪反应和被动披露倾向，并设计多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的模型在问询能力上仍有很大改进空间，对真实患者行为变化高度敏感，诊断准确性受显著影响。

Conclusion: 医疗AI需要在不同评估维度间取得平衡，在现实临床环境中兼顾性能与实用性是一大挑战。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出SemanticShield框架，通过整合商品侧语义特征和LLM技术来检测推荐系统中的灌水攻击，相比传统方法具有更好的检测效果和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统防御方法主要关注用户行为特征，忽略了商品标题、描述等语义信息可能暴露的恶意意图，存在检测盲区。

Method: 采用两阶段检测框架：第一阶段通过低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段使用LLM进行语义一致性审计。通过强化学习微调轻量级LLM，设计专门的奖励函数来优化检测器。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上的实验证明SemanticShield有效对抗灌水攻击，对未见过的攻击方法也展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合商品侧语义特征和LLM技术，显著提升了推荐系统对灌水攻击的检测能力，具有良好的实用性和泛化性。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了LLM置信度估计的传统方法，提出通过历史正确性信息训练通用正确性模型(GCM)，发现可靠置信度估计是可泛化的技能而非依赖自我反思。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将置信度估计视为LLM的"自我认知"问题，但实验表明LLM预测自身输出正确性的能力并不优于其他LLM，需要新的置信度估计方法。

Method: 提出通用正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入历史正确性信息进行训练；探索了多种方法包括上下文示例和事后校准；在5个模型家族和多个数据集上进行评估。

Result: GCM能够跨数据集和模型学习正确性预测模式；答案措辞是正确性的强预测因子；包含历史上下文示例可改善正确性预测；事后校准可补充减少校准误差。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM置信度估计是通过系统编码正确性历史学习的可泛化、模型无关技能，而非依赖自我反思的模型特定技能。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型底层的计算机制。

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法：匹配师生模型中的功能对应电路组件，引入反映这些组件诱导表示相似性的损失函数。

Result: 在Llama3系列模型的实体跟踪和心智理论任务上，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，仅调整学生模型的小部分参数即可成功转移算法能力。

Conclusion: 证明了转移计算机制的可行性，为通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制高效蒸馏特定教师能力提供了可能。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiDi-Instruct是一种基于训练的快速文本生成方法，通过从预训练的离散扩散语言模型初始化，实现64倍加速，在OpenWebText上优于GPT-2基线和标准dLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI时代，快速生成语言文本是人们追求的目标。当前语言生成模型速度较慢，需要开发高效的加速方法。

Method: 基于积分KL散度最小化框架，从预训练离散扩散语言模型初始化，采用分组奖励归一化、中间状态匹配和奖励引导祖先采样等技术。

Result: 在OpenWebText上，DiDi-Instruct在8-128次函数评估中实现62.2到18.4的困惑度，仅损失1%熵值，训练时间减少20倍，速度提升64倍。

Conclusion: DiDi-Instruct是一种高效有效的蒸馏方法，能够实现眨眼间的语言生成，在蛋白质序列生成等任务中也表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

TL;DR: 提出了GateMABSA模型，一种新颖的门控多模态架构，用于解决多模态方面情感分析中的视觉噪声过滤和跨模态对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方面情感分析模型难以过滤视觉噪声，并且无法有效跨模态对齐方面与意见内容。

Method: GateMABSA集成了句法、语义和融合感知的mLSTM，包括Syn-mLSTM（句法结构）、Sem-mLSTM（方面-语义相关性）和Fuse-mLSTM（选择性多模态融合）。

Result: 在两个基准Twitter数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过门控多模态架构有效解决了多模态方面情感分析中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释性方法（如直接logit归因和稀疏自编码器）对LLM内部表示的理解有限，存在模型输出词汇表限制和特征名称不清晰等问题。

Method: 结合符号表示和神经探针，使用向量符号架构将模型的残差流投影到可解释概念中，克服了SAE和传统探针的关键限制。

Result: 在控制输入补全任务和问答设置中验证了该解码范式，能够可靠地提取有意义的概念，并帮助识别LLM失败。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了LLM向量空间中的信息解码，能够从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型作为语音识别后处理模块的能力，特别关注其在纠正障碍语音识别错误方面的应用，旨在解决传统ASR系统在障碍语音处理中的性能不足问题。

Method: 提出置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入LLM训练中，通过微调LLaMA 3.1模型，与仅使用转录文本的微调和基于置信度的后处理过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音数据集上实现了10%的相对词错误率降低，在TORGO数据集上实现了47%的相对词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 置信度感知的微调方法对于障碍语音识别具有显著效果，能够有效指导模型关注不确定的ASR区域并减少过度纠正问题。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer在程序执行跟踪生成任务上的能力，该任务通过长跟踪序列外部化推理过程，每个步骤都很简单，旨在测试模型在算法推理任务上的泛化性能。

Method: 训练小型Transformer模型，采用多种架构修改：替代位置编码、softmax替代方案、混合模型和短卷积，在程序跟踪生成任务上进行测试。

Result: 模型在分布内数据上获得强准确率，但在泛化到不同因素（如程序长度、跟踪步骤数）时出现系统性失败，某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer在程序跟踪生成任务上表现良好，但在泛化到不同规模的问题时存在系统性限制，某些架构修改能有效提升泛化性能。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

Conclusion: DataMind框架成功构建了高性能的开源数据分析智能体，在多个基准测试中超越了专有模型，为社区提供了可操作的智能体训练见解和开源资源。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

Method: 使用小型LLM构建高效框架，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据、上下文学习作为基线方法，并提出基于输出概率的过滤策略检测和抑制有害简化。

Conclusion: 为小型LLM的高效安全词汇简化建立了基准，揭示了性能、效率和安全之间的关键权衡，展示了安全实际部署的有前景方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures
(P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual
Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current
capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question
answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new
paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource
settings.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中的语言偏见和检索偏见问题，评估了6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，发现模型在高资源语言上表现更好，且检索系统存在偏向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言LLM在跨语言事实核查中表现出语言偏见，在高资源语言上表现优于低资源语言，同时检索系统存在检索偏见，导致信息检索过程不均衡。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，采用完全多语言提示策略，评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，分析模型家族、规模和提示策略的影响，并研究多语言嵌入模型的检索偏见。

Result: 发现LLM行为存在持续偏见，跨语言性能存在显著差异，检索系统对某些声明的检索频率不均衡，导致流行声明的检索性能被夸大而较少见声明被低估。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言事实核查中的偏见问题，为改善多语言事实核查的公平性提供了建议。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PbT是一个两阶段的师生框架，无需人工标注或平行数据即可合成准确的输入-输出对。通过让教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为中间表示，然后训练学生从IR重构输入，从而生成高质量合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源自然语言生成场景中，通常只有原始输入或输出数据，但很少同时拥有两者。这迫使小模型只能从极少示例中学习，或依赖大LLM生成的昂贵、宽泛的合成示例。

Method: 两阶段师生管道：1) 教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为简洁中间表示(IR)；2) 训练学生从IR重构输入，使学生生成的输入能与输出配对。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，仅使用PbT数据训练的8B学生模型优于在70B教师生成语料上训练的模型，接近人类标注对的性能，仅以直接合成三分之一的标注成本填补了82%的oracle差距。

Conclusion: PbT能够生成领域内源数据，避免直接合成中的不匹配问题，在人类评估中证明其能产生简洁、忠实且符合目标风格的摘要。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用NVFP4格式稳定训练大语言模型的新方法，通过随机Hadamard变换、二维量化方案、随机舍入和选择性高精度层等技术，在4位精度下成功训练了120亿参数模型，性能与FP8基线相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练前沿模型需要巨大的计算和能源投入，提高预训练效率对于下一代更强大的LLMs至关重要。虽然8位浮点训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄的4位精度可以进一步改善计算速度和资源利用率，但这一级别的量化对训练稳定性、收敛性和实现提出了挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换来限制块级异常值；采用二维量化方案确保前向和后向传播的一致性表示；使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计；结合选择性高精度层。

Result: 在100万亿tokens上训练了120亿参数模型——这是迄今为止公开记录的最长4位精度训练运行。使用NVFP4预训练技术的模型在训练损失和下游任务准确性方面与FP8基线相当。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合本文的训练方法代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，证明了4位精度训练的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Conclusion: EasySteer成功将引导技术从研究技术转变为生产就绪能力，为可部署、可控的语言模型建立了关键基础设施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready
capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM评估方法推理成本高，而直接评分回归方法受限于尺度不一致问题，需要开发更高效且准确的论文质量评估框架。

Method: 采用领域-年份分组内的成对学习减少评审评分不一致性，引入评审倾向信号作为评审分数和置信度的概率整合，构建大规模数据集NAIDv2进行训练。

Result: 在ICLR数据集上达到78.2% AUC和0.432 Spearman相关系数的SOTA性能，推理时保持线性时间效率，在NeurIPS数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: NAIPv2建立了一个去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，为未来科学智能系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

TL;DR: 提出了Truthful Text Summarization (TTS)框架，通过激励对齐机制提高文本摘要的事实准确性，无需真实标签即可增强事实鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在合成多个文本时缺乏对信息源准确性的激励机制，容易受到对抗性内容的影响。

Method: TTS框架：(i)将草稿摘要分解为原子声明；(ii)获取每个信息源对每个声明的立场；(iii)使用改进的多任务同伴预测机制评分信息源；(iv)在重新摘要前过滤不可靠信息源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了流畅性，使信息暴露与信息佐证对齐，并抑制了操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS通过形式化保证使信息源激励与信息诚实对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化策略，有效提升了文本摘要的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归解码需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有并行解码策略使用固定启发式方法，无法适应输入特性，导致速度-质量权衡不佳。

Method: 训练轻量级过滤器模型预测token位置是否匹配最终输出，近似oracle并行解码策略。引入EoTP检测序列结束，避免填充token的冗余解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中实现22.58倍加速且无性能损失，结合KV-Cache可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: Learn2PD提供了一种灵活高效的并行解码方法，显著提升扩散式LLM的推理速度，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant
decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop,
and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage

behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy

Conclusion: Q2E方法通过分解查询和融合多模态知识，有效提升了零样本多语言文本到视频检索的性能，音频信息的加入进一步增强了检索效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，影响实际应用中的可信度。需要一种方法来测量模型是否能够拒绝视觉上矛盾的陈述。

Method: 引入MATS行为审计框架，通过激活修补技术因果定位失败位置，包括生成式模型的中晚期交叉注意力和对比模型的池化投影组件。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLMs（如LLaVA 1.5、QwenVLchat）表现出极低的空间一致性评分和较高的错误同意率，而对比编码器（如CLIP、SigLIP）则更为稳健。

Conclusion: 通过激活修补技术可以准确定位模型失败的具体位置，为模型修复提供了具体路径，对比编码器在视觉一致性方面表现优于生成式模型。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

Method: 基于对数极坐标傅里叶变换，结合交叉相关最大化策略，采用辅助函数方法，并整合亚像素级交叉相关来实现精确估计。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散交叉相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效且精确地联合估计图像间的尺度和旋转变化，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [201] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法解决Vision Mambas中token随图像分辨率二次增长的问题，通过双向最近邻合并和保护隐藏状态来保持序列依赖性和稳定性，在显著减少token的同时仅带来微小精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas虽然具有次二次复杂度，但效率仍受限于token随图像分辨率的二次增长。现有方法忽略了ViMs内在的有限方向序列依赖性(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: 1) 双向最近邻合并：通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖性；2) 隐藏状态保护：稳定类别token周围的隐藏状态；3) 利用Mamba的层间损失收敛将时间遗忘性转化为稳定性。

Result: ViM-Ti在20% token减少时仅损失1.0%精度，ViM-S在40% token减少时仅损失1.4%精度，实现了最先进的效率。

Conclusion: STM方法以最小复杂度实现了最先进的效率，同时为状态空间模型动力学提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于高光谱图像理解的视觉语言模型优化方法，通过CLIP风格的对比训练框架，将体素级视觉嵌入映射到冻结的大型嵌入模型潜在空间，仅更新0.07%参数即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未得到充分探索，需要优化视觉语言模型以实现更好的高光谱场景理解。

Method: 采用CLIP风格的对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络的体素级嵌入映射到冻结大型嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示。使用精心筛选的困难负样本和半困难负样本进行对比学习，并引入描述性提示作为结构化锚点。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上，相比单模态和多模态基线方法，总体准确率提升0.92%，Kappa系数提升1.60；在Pavia University数据集上，总体准确率提升0.69%，Kappa系数提升0.90。参数量比DCTN小50倍，比SS-TMNet小90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法仅更新0.07%的总参数即可实现最先进的性能，证明了在高光谱图像理解任务中，通过精心设计的跨模态对齐策略可以显著提升模型效率与性能。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨设备协作精炼模块实现单轮联邦提示学习，在保持跨任务泛化能力的同时解决数据异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，而单轮联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力。需要一种既能单轮通信又能保持跨任务泛化的方法。

Method: 使用注意力隔离模块抑制可学习提示令牌对原始文本令牌的注意力，重新加权反向注意力；通过跨设备协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识并校准全局提示。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过非干扰注意力掩码和全局提示精炼，成功实现了单轮联邦提示学习，在保持通信效率的同时提升了跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中缺乏所有类别完整训练数据的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中需要识别未见物体类别的挑战。

Method: 结合生成式零样本学习和混合专家层，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，通过MoE生成器生成逼真的未见类别特征。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在COVERED数据集上显著提升了可见和未见类别的分割性能。

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE为3D环境理解提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在缺乏完整训练数据的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中缺乏CNN的归纳偏置，这在大数据集上可以学习，但在小数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformer引入归纳偏置，无需知识蒸馏。

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过学习掩码引入归纳偏置是提升小数据集上视觉Transformer性能的有效方法。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理和组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成多对象场景的合理空间布局，解决了传统扩散模型缺乏空间推理能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但缺乏显式的空间推理能力，导致对象布局不真实；而传统机器人空间规划方法虽然强调几何一致性，但难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性。

Method: 首先使用视觉语言模型进行输入预处理（分割、对象尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散方法合成符合场景图对象关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器在规划布局中渲染对象。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局连贯性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功地将视觉语言推理与组合扩散相结合，为多对象场景生成提供了既语义丰富又空间合理的布局解决方案。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准数据集，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务，揭示了当前VLMs在视觉比较推理方面的系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但研究不足的能力，需要专门的基准来评估和诊断模型在这方面的表现。

Method: 构建了CompareBench基准数据集，包含1000个QA对，分为数量（600）、时间（100）、几何（200）和空间（100）四个任务，基于两个辅助数据集TallyBench和HistCaps。评估了闭源API和开源模型。

Result: 结果显示明显的规模扩展趋势，但模型存在关键局限：即使在时间排序和空间关系等基本任务上也会失败，在人类看来很简单的计数和几何比较中经常出错。

Conclusion: 视觉比较推理是当前VLMs的系统性盲点，CompareBench为推进更可靠的多模态推理提供了诊断性评估基础。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法。

Method: 在统一多模态理解和生成框架中，通过策略梯度方法在统一潜在空间中搜索图像和文本标记的向量表示，使用图像质量评判器进行指导，完全在测试时操作。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均达到最先进结果，特别是在知识密集的WISE上获得0.63的总体分数，比基线提高80%。

Conclusion: 在统一潜在空间中进行联合推理是MILR强大性能的关键，该方法在时间和文化推理方面展现出显著能力，证明了推理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

TL;DR: 提出了UESA-Net网络，通过多方向收缩注意力机制解决超声图像分割中的语义鸿沟问题，在甲状腺和乳腺超声数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像在乳腺和甲状腺病变检测中具有成本效益，但存在斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱等问题。现有网络难以平衡高级语义与低级空间细节，需要开发能弥合全局上下文与局部细节语义鸿沟的分割框架。

Method: 采用U形网络结构，编码器-解码器架构捕获长程依赖和细粒度结构。编码块中沿水平、垂直和深度方向运行注意力模块，结合收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征。解码器应用成对收缩机制，结合低级物理线索和编码器特征增强上下文建模。

Result: 在TN3K（3493张图像）和BUSI（780张图像）两个公共数据集上，UESA-Net分别达到0.8487和0.6495的IoU分数，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，有效提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分紧密相关类别所需的详细部件级线索。

Method: PartCo框架通过利用部件级关系来捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签和部件级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

Method: DEFT框架将预训练权重矩阵的更新分解为两个组件：1) 在低秩矩阵张成的子空间补集上的投影；2) 低秩更新。单个可训练低秩矩阵定义子空间，另一个可训练低秩矩阵在该子空间内实现灵活参数适应。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus、InsDet和VisualCloze数据集上的广泛实验表明，DEFT在个性化、对象场景适应和视觉上下文学习的通用图像生成框架中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持计算效率和参数效率的同时，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维度、可解释的视频评估框架，专门针对文本到视频生成任务，从视觉质量、语义对齐和物理一致性三个维度进行详细评估，并提供推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频评估方法通常只提供单一分数，缺乏可解释性，无法全面捕捉视频质量的多方面特性，因此需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO强化学习来增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个跨域基准上平均性能达到50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2在视频评估方面表现出色，提供可解释的评估结果，并通过有效的奖励建模为可控生成搭建桥梁。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型（SSMs）的测试时自适应方法，通过利用多种遍历排列生成输入图像的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来指导Mamba特定参数的更新，从而提高在分布偏移下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法，利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签更新Mamba特定参数，并通过权重平均整合不同遍历扫描的学习信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST持续提升了鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的方法，有效解决了SSMs在分布偏移下的泛化性能下降问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB是首个用于评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准，包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四大类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在个性化适应方面研究不足，而视觉个性化对于面向用户的AI系统（如智能家居和医疗保健）至关重要。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的MMPB基准，将个性化分为三种任务类型，使用23个开源和闭源VLM模型，通过三阶段协议（概念注入、多轮对话、个性化查询）进行评估。

Result: 大多数VLM在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难，存在拒绝行为和长上下文遗忘等问题。

Conclusion: MMPB揭示了VLM个性化方面的显著改进空间，为未来真正个性化的多模态AI研究提供了有价值的见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，攻击者可以自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的错误分类结果。该方法结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法大多依赖不切实际的白盒假设、非目标攻击目标，或产生视觉上明显的补丁，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种同时确保真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性的方法。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的语义感知补丁放置策略，实现语义感知的定位，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击有效性。

Result: 在卷积网络（DenseNet-121、ResNet-50）和视觉变换器（ViT-B/16、Swin-B/16等）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到了最先进的性能，攻击成功率（ASR）和目标类别成功率（TCS）均超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架同时确保了真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性这三个最具挑战性的维度，为对抗性鲁棒性研究建立了新的基准，弥合了理论攻击强度与实际隐蔽性之间的差距。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

TL;DR: CrossScaleNet是一个结合跨注意力机制和多尺度处理的时间序列预测架构，在保持高性能的同时提供时间可解释性，解决了传统后处理方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测中的可解释性对于提高模型透明度和支持决策至关重要。传统的时间显著性检测后处理方法计算成本高，特别是在与特征重要性检测相比时。

Method: 提出CrossScaleNet架构，结合基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，在训练过程中嵌入注意力机制来提供内在的时间可解释性。

Result: 在合成数据集和公共基准测试上的验证表明，该方法在识别时间显著性方面具有鲁棒性。在真实世界数据集上的实验显示，该方法在保持预测精度的同时，持续优于大多数基于Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet填补了现有可解释模型在标准基准测试上性能不足的空白，提供了一种平衡的方法，既能有效捕捉时间显著性，又能在不同复杂度的数据集上实现最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的多模态交互感知网络，用于PET/CT图像中肺部肿瘤内部总靶区（IGTV）的精确分割，通过切片交互模块和2.5D分割框架显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，精确分割IGTV对移动肿瘤（如肺癌）的放射治疗至关重要，但面临注释数据集有限和PET信号强度在肿瘤边界衰减的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练在大量GTV数据集上的多模态交互感知网络，在私有IGTV数据集上进行微调；引入切片交互模块（SIM）在2.5D分割框架中建模切片间关系，集成通道和空间注意力分支与深度卷积。

Result: 在私有IGTV数据集上达到Dice系数0.609，显著优于传统基线方法的0.385。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和SIM模块在提高IGTV分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力，对肺癌放射治疗规划具有重要意义。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率和高动态范围等生物启发特性，但获取大规模标注的事件数据既困难又昂贵，限制了事件视觉任务的发展。

Method: 利用Stable Diffusion等基础模型的扩散先验，通过最小化微调和有限标注数据实现高质量事件数据生成，支持文本标签、2D骨架和3D姿态等多种控制信号。

Result: 实验表明，合成的标注事件数据在视觉识别、2D骨架估计和3D姿态估计等任务中都能提升模型性能，且能基于未见过的文本标签生成事件数据。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了数据生成流程，显著降低了标注事件数据集的成本，继承了基础模型强大的文本生成能力，为事件视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR方法，首次将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）集成到基于隐式神经表示（INRs）的可变形图像配准中，通过随机基函数采样策略降低计算成本，在多个医学影像数据集上实现了最佳配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习型方法需要大量训练数据且在某些器官类型和成像模态上精度不足，而基于INR的方法虽然精度高但需要实例特定优化，计算效率和稳定性是关键挑战。

Method: 将KANs集成到INR-based配准框架中，提出随机基函数采样策略减少所需基函数数量，同时保持配准质量。

Result: 在肺CT、脑MRI和心脏MRI三个数据集上，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在所有评估模态和解剖结构中均达到INR-based方法中的最高精度，计算开销最小，学习稳定性最佳。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR在随机基函数采样下略微优于可学习基函数索引模型，同时消除了额外的训练时间复杂性，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络（如Deep Sets和Set Transformer）只能处理向量输入，无法直接处理3D图像张量，必须与CNN特征提取器级联，这限制了性能。

Method: CST直接在3D图像张量上操作，同时执行特征提取和上下文建模，实现两个过程的协同作用。

Result: 在集合分类和集合异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法，并且与Grad-CAM等CNN可解释性方法原生兼容。

Conclusion: CST可以大规模预训练并通过标准迁移学习方案适应新领域和任务，作者发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST在红外小目标检测中实现了优异的性能和泛化能力，计算效率显著提升，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的参数化表示具有非唯一性和异构性，直接输入神经网络会导致高度数据依赖的模型，需要更原则性的表示方法

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的本质信息，保持颜色和几何结构，同时强制唯一映射和通道同质性

Result: 该方法能够更好地服务于3D高斯泼溅的学习，为基于3DGS的学习系统提供更有效的向量化表示

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法解决了3D高斯泼溅在神经网络学习中的根本挑战，为相关应用提供了更可靠的表示基础

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Conclusion: 软嵌入方法成功解决了传统一步生成器的局限性，使生成器能够进行端到端训练，并支持GAN优化、奖励微调和测试时嵌入优化等后处理技术。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),

Result: FishAI 2.0在科级分类上达到Top-1准确率91.67%和Top-5准确率97.97%，显著优于基线CLIP和ViT模型；在属级和种级分别达到87.58%和85.42%的Top-1准确率。

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Motivation: 当前颅内出血(ICH)的及时诊断是临床重点，但AI解决方案开发受限于碎片化的公开数据，需要高质量标注数据集来推动研究。

Method: 收集2012-2024年间的372个头部CT检查，采用双读流程和神经外科医生仲裁进行标注，包含五类出血亚型的分类标签、边界框和像素/体素掩码。

Result: 轻量级模型MobileViT-XS在二元分类中达到87.8%的F1分数，U-Net+DenseNet161在病变分割中达到85.5%的Dice分数，验证了数据质量和样本量充足性。

Conclusion: Hemorica提供了统一、细粒度的基准数据集，支持多任务和课程学习，有助于设计基于AI的ICH检测和量化辅助系统。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

TL;DR: ARSS是一个基于自回归Transformer的新颖视图生成框架，通过GPT风格的解码器从单张图像生成多视角视图，解决了扩散模型在视图合成中的一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成质量上表现出色，但在世界建模任务（如稀疏输入的新颖视图生成）中存在局限性，因为其非因果生成方式会导致视图间的扭曲和不一致。自回归模型具有因果特性，更适合这类任务。

Method: 使用视频分词器将连续图像序列映射为离散token，提出相机编码器将相机轨迹转换为3D位置引导，并设计自回归Transformer模块在保持时间顺序的同时随机置换token的空间顺序。

Result: 在公开数据集上的定性和定量实验表明，该方法在性能上可与基于扩散模型的最先进视图合成方法相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: ARSS框架证明了自回归模型在视图合成任务中的有效性，为世界建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非动态人体运动（静态偏差），这导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中性能不佳。

Method: 使用统计独立性损失分离偏置和无偏置流，结合场景预测损失。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏差，并确认场景预测损失的重要性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效缓解动作识别中的静态偏差问题，场景预测损失是关键组成部分。

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为'去敏感对抗训练'(DesenAT)的方法，通过特征去敏感化生成对抗样本并在自蒸馏框架内进行训练，旨在缓解DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，从而提高模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 由于场景复杂性、传感器不精确性和处理不精确性，点云损坏不可避免。DNN对输入特征的过度依赖是其脆弱性的根本原因。本研究旨在探索在3D点云任务中是否存在这一问题，以及减少对这些特征的依赖是否能增强模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DesenAT方法：1）使用Shapley值量化DNN对点云特征的敏感性；2）通过消除高贡献成分的数据点并使用空间变换模拟损坏场景来生成对抗样本；3）在自蒸馏框架内进行对抗训练，将干净样本的知识转移到对抗样本中。

Result: 在ModelNet-C和PointCloud-C上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效提高模型的鲁棒性，同时不会降低在干净数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: DesenAT方法通过平滑敏感性有效缓解了DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，显著提升了模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性，为3D点云任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Conclusion: 该方法在手语翻译中显著提升了解剖学真实性和运动自然度，为改善聋人和听力障碍者的沟通提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖基于语言的推理，限制了推理和决策能力。统一多模态模型支持多模态输入输出，通过生成视觉内容进行推理，具有更大的决策潜力。

Method: 提出Uni-Plan规划框架，单个模型同时作为策略、动态模型和价值函数。引入自判别过滤方法，让生成模型作为自判别器过滤无效的动态预测以避免幻觉。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用统一多模态模型进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Motivation: 大型视觉模型如Stable Diffusion可能记忆和复制受版权保护内容，现有检测方法缺乏鲁棒性和理论支撑，需要解决这一法律和伦理问题。

Result: DPM框架能够可靠检测侵权内容，无需访问原始训练数据集或文本提示，构建了CIDD数据集用于标准化基准测试。

Conclusion: DPM为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供了可解释且实用的解决方案，在版权侵权检测方面表现出色。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Motivation: 洪水灾害频发造成重大损失，需要快速准确的洪水淹没制图。现有遥感技术面临天气依赖、重访周期有限、计算资源需求大等挑战。

Method: 微调轻量级多模态预训练变换器Presto（约0.4M参数），处理SAR和多光谱数据，支持单传感器或融合输入的单模型架构。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11数据集上优于Prithvi-100M基线，融合场景F1得分0.896，mIoU 0.886；多光谱场景F1 0.893；SAR场景F1 0.718。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了参数高效、传感器灵活的解决方案，适用于实际灾害场景中的快速洪水范围评估。

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化(GCR)增强位姿回归方法，在训练时利用深度信息生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过加权RANSAC计算几何一致位姿作为监督信号，使回归网络学习几何一致性，无需推理时的几何计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R内部表示的几何不一致性问题，克服回归方法速度与精度的权衡，在不牺牲推理速度的前提下接近基于对应关系方法的精度。

Method: 训练时使用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，加权RANSAC计算几何一致位姿，构建一致性损失来训练回归网络。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升至40.45%(相对提升16%)，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升至68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升至50.45%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过在训练而非推理时教授几何一致性，实现了回归方法的速度与对应关系方法的几何理解能力的结合，代表了神经网络学习相机几何的新范式。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

### [238] [Activation Matching for Explanation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051)
*Pirzada Suhail,Aditya Anand,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于激活匹配的方法，为预训练分类器在任意图像上的决策生成最小化、忠实解释。通过训练轻量自编码器输出二值掩码，使解释图像既保持模型预测又对齐中间激活分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供既忠实又简洁的解释，既要保持模型行为又要最小化相关区域，提高可解释性。

Method: 结合多目标优化：多层级激活匹配（KL散度对齐分布、交叉熵保持标签）、掩码先验（L1面积最小化、二值化惩罚、总变差紧凑性）和溯因约束保证忠实性。

Result: 生成的小型、人类可解释掩码能够保留分类器行为同时丢弃不相关输入区域，提供实用且忠实的极简解释。

Conclusion: 该方法通过综合优化目标实现了对预训练分类器决策的有效解释，平衡了忠实性、最小化和可解释性需求。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

TL;DR: 提出Mask What Matters框架，通过文本引导的可控掩码策略改进医学图像的自监督学习，在降低掩码比例的同时提升分类、检测等任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据稀缺，现有自监督掩码图像建模方法采用随机高比例掩码，导致效率低下和语义对齐不佳。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，对诊断相关区域实施差异化掩码，减少背景冗余。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部CT和肺部X光等多种医学图像模态上，分类准确率提升达+3.1%，检测任务中BoxAP提升+1.3，MaskAP提升+1.1，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Motivation: 航空图像中微小物体检测面临视觉线索有限和全局上下文建模困难的问题，现有方法存在上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足的瓶颈。

Method: 使用WeKat骨干网络进行小波变换增强全局低频上下文感知，结合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行自适应非线性建模；采用轻量级CPF模块减少冗余；引入MDFC模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在基准航空数据集上达到最先进性能，VisDrone数据集上AP提升6.5%，AP50提升8.2%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航空图像微小物体检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局信息，实现了更好的检测性能。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Conclusion: 通过重新审视偏好对齐的基本问题，使用现有工具和方法，无需改变模型结构或使用新数据集，就能显著提升图像修复的性能，为这一有前景的研究方向设定了简单而坚实的基准。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is
open-sourced at: https://github.com/shenytzzz/Follow-Your-Preference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理高倍放大图像，计算成本过高，难以在临床环境中部署。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，结合全局图像表示和局部空间token映射的双层知识转移，使用紧凑骨干网络完全在5x放大倍数下运行。

Result: 在6个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，诊断准确性与大型基础模型相差不到1%，处理速度达到每分钟8.8张全玻片图像，实现30倍加速。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型能力的可行方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。文本流中现有方法主要关注主要名词短语而忽略上下文标记，视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致对空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch框架在语言方面构建包含空间线索的混合文本特征，在视觉方面从中间层提取补丁级图像特征，这些增强特征融合到聚类图像文本相似度图CoMap中，实现精确掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上显著提升了零样本参考图像分割的空间定位能力（提升2-7 mIoU），无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有但未被充分利用的空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对于在能源受限的边缘设备上高效部署深度神经网络至关重要。

Method: HTMA-Net选择性地用混合Hadamard变换层替换中间卷积层，这些层的内部卷积通过免乘法内存操作实现。

Result: 在ResNet-18、ResNet-20和ResNet-50模型上，HTMA-Net最多可消除52%的乘法运算，同时保持相当的准确率，并显著降低计算复杂度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 将结构化Hadamard变换层与SRAM内存计算免乘法操作相结合，是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景的路径。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Method: 构建ChangeIMTI多任务指令数据集，设计ChangeVG视觉引导视觉语言模型，采用双分支架构结合细粒度空间特征提取和高级语义总结。

Conclusion: 提出的ChangeIMTI数据集和ChangeVG模型有效解决了遥感变化理解的多任务挑战，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型面临计算与保真度的权衡挑战：基于VAE的模型存在信息丢失、细节有限且无法端到端训练；像素空间模型计算成本过高；级联模型虽降低计算成本但阶段分离阻碍端到端优化和知识共享。

Method: 提出条件依赖耦合策略的统一多阶段生成框架，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，确保准确分布学习同时支持端到端优化。整个过程建模为单一统一扩散变换器，消除分离模块需求并促进知识共享。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个分辨率下同时实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了图像生成中计算效率与保真度的权衡问题，通过条件依赖耦合策略和统一扩散变换器实现了准确分布学习和端到端优化。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke

address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised

SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂地球观测任务时能力有限，现有代理方法局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建Earth-Agent框架，统一RGB和光谱EO数据，在MCP工具生态系统中动态调用专家工具和跨模态模型，支持复杂科学任务。同时提出Earth-Bench基准，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像。

Result: 通过不同LLM骨干网络、与通用代理框架和MLLMs的对比实验，证明了Earth-Agent的有效性和潜力。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为EO分析建立了新范式，推动该领域向科学基础扎实的下一代LLM应用发展。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth

TL;DR: WeatherCycle是一个统一的无监督多天气图像恢复框架，通过双向退化-内容转换循环和退化感知课程正则化，实现多天气条件下的图像恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的天气图像恢复方法通常依赖任务特定的物理先验，其狭窄的焦点限制了在多样化真实天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 1. 采用亮度-色度分解策略解耦退化与内容；2. 提出亮度退化引导模块(LDGM)学习退化先验；3. 引入难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块增强语义一致性。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中达到了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一的框架有效解决了多天气图像恢复问题，无需配对数据即可实现高质量的图像恢复。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense是一个基于关键点的生成框架，使用稀疏3D关键点作为传输符号，实现超低码率人体视频压缩和精确顶点预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 提出多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，并利用这些稀疏关键点估计密集运动以实现时间一致性和真实纹理的视频合成，同时集成顶点预测器学习人体顶点几何。

Result: 大量实验表明，Sparse2Dense在人体视频压缩方面优于传统/生成视频编解码器，同时能够实现精确的人体顶点预测。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人体动画和沉浸式娱乐。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频的端到端车轴计数系统，使用YOLO-OBB检测车辆、YOLO检测轮胎，结合TRAX算法跟踪车轴特征，显著提升长车辆和遮挡场景下的计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的车轴计数对交通控制、收费和基础设施发展至关重要，现有方法在密集环境中的长车辆和遮挡场景存在局限性。

Method: 结合YOLO-OBB车辆检测分类和YOLO轮胎检测，提出TRAX算法跟踪车轴特征，智能关联轮胎与所属车辆。

Result: 显著减少误报，提高长车辆车轴计数准确性，在真实交通视频中展现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为可扩展的AI驱动车轴计数系统迈出重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来改进SAM模型在医学图像分割中的领域泛化能力和校准性能，仅微调掩码解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在应用于医学体积数据时存在领域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(i)通过3D特征图上的特征Fisher信息惩罚减少编码器对领域偏移的敏感性；(ii)通过置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级错误。仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提高了准确性和校准：在BraTS扫描仪分割上，DSC相对提高+7.4%，HD95减少-26.9%，ECE减少-39.5%。在ATLAS-C上，DSC相对提高+5.3%，ECE减少-32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM为脑MRI分割提供了改进的领域泛化和更好的校准不确定性估计，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督3D实例分割方法存在训练多样性有限、时间采样僵化、过度依赖噪声伪标签等问题，需要提升分割精度和时间关联鲁棒性。

Method: 使用合成点云序列生成增强训练分布，采用灵活时间采样策略（相邻和非相邻帧），结合动态加权损失强调置信样本。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和PandaSet数据集上，该方法持续优于UNIT和其他无监督基线，获得更高的分割精度和更鲁棒的时间关联。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过增强训练多样性、灵活时间建模和智能损失加权，显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击大多局限于数字域或需要白盒访问，而人脸识别系统面临严重安全威胁，需要开发在黑盒设置下有效的物理可转移攻击方法。

Method: 使用查询高效的零阶贪婪算法，通过逐步添加高斯斑点来迭代构建对称灰度图案，仅依赖替代FR模型的余弦相似度分数来最大化降低身份识别准确率。

Result: 仅需约10,000次查询即可在黑盒ArcFace模型上实现高攻击成功率，在数字和现实物理测试中均有效，并且成功欺骗了未见过的FaceNet模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统的实际严重漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建出鲁棒且可转移的攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for
studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However,
real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low
signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We
propose UltraUNet, a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture optimized for
real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet
incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight
Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability,
and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational
overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific
augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets
demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and
MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet
provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics,

### [257] [Patch Rebirth: Toward Fast and Transferable Model Inversion of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23235)
*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，解决了传统模型反演在Vision Transformers上的计算效率问题，同时保持知识转移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sparse Model Inversion (SMI)方法在ViTs模型反演中过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但研究发现这些patch实际上能够通过持续反演获得可转移知识，丢弃它们会抑制类无关和类特定特征的提取。

Method: PRI方法在反演过程中逐步分离最重要的patch来构建稀疏图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化以供未来选择，实现渐进式稀疏化。

Result: 实验结果显示PRI比标准Dense Model Inversion快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上持续优于SMI并与DMI性能相当。

Conclusion: PRI通过Rebirth效应有效平衡类无关和类特定知识，在提升效率的同时保持知识转移性能，为ViTs的高效数据自由学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用模型自身长回答与短答案之间一致性来生成训练数据的框架，通过自反思维管道自动检测不一致信号，无需人工标注或外部监督即可减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中常见的幻觉问题，即生成不存在对象或不准确属性，这些影响了输出可靠性。现有方法依赖大量人工标注或更强大模型的外部监督，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 设计自反思维管道，利用短二元问题的高可靠性回答来评估和排序模型生成的详细响应。通过比较详细响应与简洁二元答案的一致性，自动生成偏好对训练数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试（AMBER、MultiObject-Hal、Object HalBench、MMHal-Bench）上显著改善了事实基础和可靠性，同时在LLaVA-Bench和MMBench上保持了强大的指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能有效利用未标记数据减少幻觉，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Motivation: 传统时尚搭配推荐方法需要昂贵的大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏明确的人类美学指导。在MLLM时代，作者希望将传统训练流程简化为无需训练的模式，获得更好的推荐分数和美学感知能力。

Method: 使用MLLMs生成目标物品描述，通过美学链式思维将图像提炼为结构化美学配置文件（颜色、风格、场合、季节、材质、平衡），通过动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量，在共享嵌入空间中排名候选物品。

Result: 在真实评估集Aesthetic-100上，TATTOO相比现有基于训练的方法达到了最先进的性能。在标准Polyvore数据集上也展示了先进的零样本检索能力。

Conclusion: TATTOO证明在MLLM时代，传统基于训练的时尚搭配推荐流程可以简化为无需训练的模式，同时获得更好的推荐效果和美学感知能力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Result: 生成的图像更加真实和多样化。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法有效提升了RGB到热成像图像转换的质量和多样性，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据支持。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

<details>

Motivation: 人体活动识别在医疗保健、制造和人机交互中有重要应用。LiDAR点云提供隐私保护且对光照变化鲁棒，但需要开发有效的特征提取方法替代端到端深度学习。

Method: 将LiDAR帧映射为邻近图（ε图），计算拉普拉斯谱，使用特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，通过滑动窗口时间统计得到固定向量，最后用支持向量机和随机森林分类。

Result: 在MM-Fi数据集（40个受试者，27种活动）的严格受试者独立协议下，在13类康复活动上达到94.4%准确率，所有27种活动达到90.3%准确率，优于基于骨架的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法直接从点云几何中提取紧凑且可解释的特征集，为端到端深度学习提供了准确高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Motivation: 解决稀疏视图新视角合成中的几何模糊性问题，当前方法在生成完整性和几何保真度之间存在权衡：回归模型几何忠实但不完整，生成模型能完成场景但常引入结构不一致。

Method: 提出"提议-验证"框架：1）使用预训练3D感知扩散模型合成新视图提议完整场景；2）将多视角立体模型重新用作3D感知预言机，通过注意力图验证生成视图的3D不确定性；3）用不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射优化。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功将强大的生成先验与多视角几何证据相结合，在稀疏视图高斯溅射中调和了生成完整性和回归保真度。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 随着图像到视频生成模型的快速发展，恶意内容创建风险增加。现有防御方法如I2VGuard尝试免疫图像，但有效阻止运动的方法仍有待探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，通过添加对抗性扰动来显式攻击I2V模型的注意力机制，同时保持输入图像的语义完整性。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效保护图像，使生成的视频保持静止或接近静态，成功阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防止I2V生成模型被滥用的有前景方向，为稳健和主动防御提供了重要思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

TL;DR: Diff-SPK是首个基于扩散模型的脉冲相机重建方法，专门针对低光照高速场景下的脉冲流重建问题，通过ETFI模块聚合稀疏信息并利用ControlNet生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下难以处理严重的噪声和稀疏信息，需要新的方法来补充纹理信息。

Method: 使用ETFI（增强纹理间隔）模块从低光照脉冲流中聚合稀疏信息，然后作为ControlNet的条件输入生成高速场景图像，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升质量。

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上的实验表明Diff-SPK具有优越性能，同时建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集。

Conclusion: Diff-SPK通过结合生成先验和脉冲流特性，有效解决了低光照高速场景下的脉冲相机重建问题。

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Result: 在四个多模态遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了优越的分类性能。

Conclusion: BDGF框架有效解决了多模态DDPM中的模态不平衡问题，并通过扩散特征引导的多分支网络实现了高性能的土地覆盖分类。

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型看似具备文化能力，但实际上依赖表面模式匹配而非真正的文化理解，需要评估其文化推理能力。

Method: 通过分类和解释分析，测试多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景中的表现。

Result: 模型能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现困难，经常提供模糊标签或将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 提出C3-OWD框架，通过课程跨模态对比学习同时解决目标检测在开放世界中的鲁棒性和泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界目标检测面临两个关键挑战：对未见类别的泛化能力差，以及在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性不足。现有研究分别处理这两个问题，但难以同时实现鲁棒性和多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习框架：第一阶段使用RGBT数据预训练增强鲁棒性，第二阶段通过视觉-语言对齐提高泛化性。引入指数移动平均机制防止阶段间的灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在FLIR数据集上达到80.1 AP50，在OV-COCO上达到48.6 AP50_Novel，在OV-LVIS上达到35.7 mAPr，在鲁棒性和多样性评估中都表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和泛化性的优势，为开放世界目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于二值神经网络（BNN）的遥感图像全色锐化方法S2BNet，通过定制化的空间-光谱二值化卷积（S2B-Conv）解决传统二值化方法中的光谱失真和空间特征退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度学习模型在全色锐化中表现出色，但计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限设备上应用。二值神经网络（BNN）能显著降低计算成本，但直接应用于全色锐化会导致严重的光谱失真和空间特征退化。

Method: 设计了空间-光谱二值化卷积（S2B-Conv），包含光谱重分布机制（SRM）和Gabor空间特征放大器（GSFA）。SRM通过动态学习生成仿射变换参数来缓解光谱失真，GSFA通过随机选择预设范围内的频率和角度来适应多尺度和各向异性的空间特征。

Result: 大量定量和定性实验表明，该高效二值化全色锐化方法能够获得令人满意的性能。

Conclusion: S2BNet通过定制化的二值化卷积设计，成功实现了在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度的目标，为资源受限设备上的遥感图像全色锐化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息基础，导致推理路径偏离图像内容并产生错误结论。

Method: 采用无需训练的解耦方法：强大的LLM负责高层推理，策略性地询问LMM以提取所需视觉信息；LMM专门作为视觉问答引擎按需提供感知细节。

Result: 框架有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无根据的推理步骤，大幅提升推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，能有效解决LMM推理过程中的视觉基础丢失问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类特定的正负提示词解耦语义，并引入渐进置信度解耦策略来抑制假阳性，在无需重放的情况下显著提升多标签类增量学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示词的方法在单标签类增量学习中表现良好，但直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)效果不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆和部分标注引起的真阴性-假阳性混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含类特定的正负提示词来解耦语义，以及渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略来抑制假阳性。过去提示词被冻结作为知识锚点，层间提示增强了效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，DDP持续优于先前方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准下无需重放就超过80% mAP和70% F1的MLCIL方法。

Conclusion: DDP通过显式解决语义混淆和假阳性问题，为多标签类增量学习提供了有效的无重放解决方案，在多个基准上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Conclusion: LRPO框架成功将强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复，通过精心设计的奖励机制和正则化策略，在感知质量和保真度之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

Method: 采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树结构搜索，结合GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样，通过共享前缀路径减少计算开销，并设计LayerTuning-RL范式将SFT损失重新定义为动态加权的进度奖励模型。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中，分别比现有最优方法提升4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升近50%。

Conclusion: 通过树结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式，模型能够动态探索多样化的搜索空间，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [277] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种与任何预训练配准网络兼容的测试时不确定性估计框架，通过分析网络在空间扰动下的预测方差来评估配准可靠性，无需重新训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构修改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性特性，通过空间扰动输入图像并分析网络预测的方差，理论分解扰动不确定性为内在扩散和偏差抖动两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，能识别需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转变为风险感知工具，推动医学图像配准在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过将排序信号融入基于LLM的查询重写，解决CLIP模型在分布偏移场景下的检索性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在大规模检索系统中表现优异，但在输入分布与训练语料不符时（如多语言、长文本、多模态差异）性能下降。现有方法使用LLM进行查询重写，但缺乏监督信号无法生成最优查询。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，通过语料相对排序奖励解决分数膨胀问题，优化与排序指标对齐。

Result: 在多语言差异、长度差异和多模态差异等多种分布偏移场景下，GRAPE在Recall@10指标上平均提升4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE能有效提升CLIP模型在分布偏移场景下的检索性能，是一种实用的增强方法。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

*Yifan Yang,Yuxiang Yan,Boda Liu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个使用级联网络和知识蒸馏的点云补全框架，通过两阶段协同处理来解决不完整点云的形状预测和缺失区域重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中采集的点云通常由于传感器分辨率限制、单一视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，这使得点云补全对于各种应用至关重要。主要难点在于从高度不完整的点云中预测整体形状并重建缺失区域。

Method: CasPoinTr将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建阶段生成辅助信息，融合补全阶段利用这些信息并结合知识蒸馏生成最终输出。通过知识蒸馏，在更密集点云上训练的教师模型将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集上的不同难度设置实验表明，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入与完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose是一种统一的跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D人体姿态估计标注迁移到3D域，无需3D关键点标注，在RGB-D序列上实现弱监督3D人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量3D关键点标注的问题，利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D姿态标注，避免多视角相机标定和合成到真实数据迁移的问题。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动）、2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互。通过锚点到关节预测方法在RGB和深度网络上执行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上，UniPose实现了与全监督方法相当的性能。结合大规模无标签数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）可提升在挑战性条件下的性能。

Conclusion: UniPose展示了在无需3D标注的情况下实现高质量3D人体姿态估计的潜力，其3D提升方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个包含精确身体形状注册的广泛自接触数据集Goliath-SC，并基于此开发了条件于身体形状参数的自接触先验生成模型，用于改进单视角人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自接触数据集缺乏多样的自接触姿态和精确的身体形状，限制了自接触姿态与身体形状之间关系的分析。不同BMI的人在相同姿态下会产生不同的接触效果，因此需要考虑身体形状对自接触建模的影响。

Method: 1) 构建包含383K自接触姿态、130名受试者的Goliath-SC数据集；2) 提出基于身体部位潜扩散和自注意力的条件生成模型，将身体形状参数作为条件；3) 将该先验模型集成到单视角姿态估计中，并细化估计姿态使其符合接触约束。

Result: 实验表明，形状条件对于成功建模自接触姿态分布至关重要，能够显著改善单视角姿态估计在自接触场景下的性能。

Conclusion: 身体形状是自接触建模的关键因素，提出的形状条件生成模型能够有效提升自接触姿态的生成质量和单视角姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景生成方法主要关注合成多样化和高保真度的驾驶视频，但缺乏3D一致性和稀疏的视角覆盖，难以支持便捷和高质量的新视角合成。而3D/4D重建方法虽然改进了真实驾驶场景的新视角合成，但缺乏生成能力。

Method: 采用前馈框架，包括两个关键步骤：(i) 引入4D感知的潜在扩散模型，集成多模态信息以前馈方式生成像素对齐的4D高斯分布；(ii) 使用增强的视频扩散模型对从这些高斯分布渲染的新视角视频进行细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真度、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Motivation: 传统骨折诊断依赖医生经验，速度和准确性受限。深度学习模型特别是YOLO框架在骨折检测中展现出潜力，需要进一步提升检测性能。

Method: 提出了Fracture-YOLO模型，包含两个关键模块：CRSelector注意力机制利用全局纹理信息聚焦骨折区域关键特征；ScA模块动态调整多尺度特征权重，增强多尺度骨折目标识别能力。

Result: 相比基线模型，Fracture-YOLO在检测精度上显著提升，mAP50和mAP50-95分别提高了4%和3%，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: Fracture-YOLO通过集成CRSelector和ScA模块，有效提升了骨折检测的准确性和效率，为医学影像分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with
mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 现有方法难以检测形态多样且细微的骨折，主要由于成像角度多变和图像质量不佳，需要提升临床诊断效率。

Method: FracDetNet结合双焦点注意力(DFA)模块捕获局部细节和全局上下文，以及多尺度校准(MC)自适应优化特征表示。

Result: 在GRAZPEDWRI-DX数据集上达到40.0% mAP50-95（提升7.5%）、63.9% mAP50（提升4.2%），骨折检测准确率提升2.9%。

Conclusion: FracDetNet通过DFA和MC模块有效提升骨折检测性能，在多个指标上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊奇来识别视频中的关键时刻，SPIKE-RL则优化信念假设，两者结合实现基于惊奇加权的帧采样策略，在多个下游任务上超越均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的惊奇事件，但现有Video-LLMs通过均匀采样帧处理视频，可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: SPIKE量化贝叶斯惊奇作为视频流中新视觉证据触发的信念更新，识别新证据与先验信念冲突的时刻；SPIKE-RL利用GRPO基于视频字幕的奖励信号优化信念假设；两者指导与查询无关的惊奇加权帧采样。

Result: SPIKE在积极(FunQA)和消极(Oops!)惊奇基准上与人类强相关；惊奇加权帧采样在五个下游基准上相比均匀采样实现了一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过使Video-LLMs能够跟踪信念并注册惊奇，为更强大的模型铺平了道路，这些模型可以根据新信息修正其理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

TL;DR: 提出FM-SIREN和FM-FINER，通过为周期性激活函数分配神经元特定的频率乘子，减少隐式神经表示中的特征冗余，提升信号重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子，导致同一层神经元捕获重叠的频率成分，限制了多层感知机的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法启发，为周期性激活函数分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，在不增加网络深度或超参数调优的情况下引入频率多样性。

Result: 该方法将特征冗余减少近50%，在1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成等任务中持续改善信号重建性能，优于基线方法同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 通过简单的频率多样性设计，有效解决了周期性激活INR网络中的特征冗余问题，提升了网络表达能力。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: FoR-SALE是一个基于参考框架的空间调整框架，用于改进文本到图像生成中的空间理解能力，通过视觉模块提取图像空间配置并映射空间表达式到相机视角，在检测到不对齐时应用潜在空间操作来调整图像方向和深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时存在显著性能差距，需要将长期被忽视的参考框架概念整合到多模态语言模型中。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，使用视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测语言与视觉的不对齐，生成并应用编辑操作，包括新颖的潜在空间操作来调整图像方向和深度。

Result: 在两个专门评估参考框架空间理解的基准测试中，FoR-SALE将最先进T2I模型的性能提高了高达5.3%，仅需单轮校正。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE成功地将参考框架概念整合到文本到图像生成中，显著改善了模型对空间描述的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，实现一致的3D姿态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，创建视角依赖的运动信号，这使得在健康监测和运动科学等应用中的比较分析变得复杂。需要一种方法将任意输入姿态转换为一致的、身体中心的规范坐标系。

Method: 3DPCNet采用混合编码器，通过门控交叉注意力机制融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文信息，预测连续的6D旋转并映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。模型在MM-Fi数据集上使用合成旋转姿态进行自监督训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均每关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，该方法从视频中产生的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet有效消除了视角变异性，实现了物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动分析应用提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示时经常无法忠实渲染所有元素，会遗漏或错误表示特定对象和属性。测试时优化方法无需重新训练即可改进生成质量。

Method: 将输入提示分解为语义概念，使用细粒度的CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，生成关于缺失或不准确概念的详细反馈，并将反馈输入到迭代提示优化循环中。

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示上的实验表明，该方法在概念覆盖率和人类判断的忠实度方面显著优于标准测试时优化和基础T2I模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，通过概念级评估和迭代提示优化实现了更好的概念覆盖。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸防伪模型难以检测来自新目标域的未知攻击，而域适应方法在单模态中已有研究，但在多模态中尚未探索。

Method: 1) 从其他模态提取互补特征来替代缺失模态或增强现有特征；2) 利用不同模态的预测不确定性来生成可靠的伪标签；3) 设计自适应机制，在不稳定适应时降低损失权重，稳定时增加权重。

Result: 大量实验证明了MFAS-DANet的有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet成功解决了多模态人脸防伪在域适应场景下的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

TL;DR: RestoRect提出了一种新颖的潜在整流流特征蒸馏方法，通过将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题。


<details>

Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型速度过慢，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，学生通过潜在空间中的可学习轨迹学习合成教师质量特征。结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失进行跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示了优越结果，实现了更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持恢复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过整流流特征蒸馏方法有效解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模无约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形，需要更有效的运动锚定策略。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场传播主方向，然后提出方向感知超高斯表示，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入统一概率状态，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验证明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实动态场景中，相比主流方法具有更优越的重建保真度。

Conclusion: 基于方向锚定的高斯分布方法能够有效建模复杂动态场景，提供高质量4D重建。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单模态依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和模态间依赖（模态与目标任务的关系）之间的相互作用对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖的性质和交互关系仍缺乏系统表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型在23个视觉问答基准上进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用和专业知识推理、光学字符识别、文档理解等领域，量化视觉、文本及其交互的依赖关系。

Result: 研究发现视觉、问题和它们交互的依赖程度在基准之间和内部存在显著差异；许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖；这种特征在不同模型规模上持续存在，大型模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能，掩盖多模态推理的不足。

Conclusion: 提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法，揭示了当前多模态评估中存在的依赖关系不平衡问题。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Motivation: 人类能从稀疏的视觉线索（如点光源显示）中提取丰富的语义信息，这种能力源于人类的具身体验。研究旨在测试多模态大语言模型在这种最小化视觉输入条件下的动作理解能力。

Method: 创建ActPLD基准测试，使用单人和社交互动场景的点光源显示，评估包括最先进的专有和开源多模态大语言模型。

Result: 所有测试模型在点光源显示的动作理解任务中表现一致较差，揭示了模型在动作和时空理解方面的根本性缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在从最小化视觉线索中理解人类动作方面存在显著局限性，这与人类早期发展的动作理解能力形成鲜明对比。

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Motivation: 系统性硬化症中的间质性肺病是导致发病率和死亡率的主要原因，但CT在疾病进展和死亡率预测中的作用尚未完全明确。

Method: 收集了2,125例系统性硬化症患者的CT扫描，使用ResNet-18、DenseNet-121和Swin Transformer等预训练模型进行微调，分析1年、3年和5年死亡率。

Result: 模型在预测1年、3年和5年死亡率方面分别达到了0.769、0.801和0.709的AUC值。

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

Conclusion: 虽然低分辨率训练的视频模型是强大的通用基线，但我们的自适应框架代表了安全关键应用中可靠性至关重要的最先进解决方案。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

TL;DR: OVSeg3R是一个通过3D重建从2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割的训练方案，利用2D到3D的对应关系生成3D标注，并提出视图实例分区和2D实例边界感知超点算法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免昂贵的人工标注，将输入与真实世界应用对齐，利用成熟的2D感知模型来学习3D实例分割。

Method: 利用3D重建模型提供的2D到3D对应关系，将2D实例掩码预测投影到3D生成标注；提出视图实例分区算法避免错误监督；引入2D实例边界感知超点聚类方法。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试上整体提升+2.3 mAP，在标准开放词汇设置下，新类别性能比之前方法提升约+7.1 mAP。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R成功将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，显著缩小了尾部类别和头部类别之间的性能差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（癌症多发于头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确分割胰腺各区域对精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但MRI中胰腺分割因形态多变、软组织对比度差和个体解剖差异而极具挑战。

Method: 使用隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构协作训练，无需直接共享数据；系统评估了三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合；提出了新颖的解剖学感知损失函数，优先考虑MRI中区域特定的纹理对比度。

Result: 发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg的组合最适合处理胰腺异质性；在711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描的多样化数据集上实现了临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布式、异构数据集上训练仍能达到临床可行性能，为胰腺分区分割提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

TL;DR: RobuQ是一个针对扩散变换器(DiTs)的系统化量化感知训练框架，通过鲁棒量化器和激活混合精度网络，首次在ImageNet-1K等大型数据集上实现了平均2位激活量化的稳定图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs在图像生成中表现出色，但计算和内存成本高昂阻碍了实际部署。虽然量化感知训练在U-Nets中有效，但在DiTs中面临激活量化的独特挑战，特别是激活分布复杂性和敏感性。

Conclusion: RobuQ成功解决了DiTs量化中的关键挑战，为低比特DiT部署提供了可行的解决方案，显著降低了计算和内存需求，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

TL;DR: VividFace是一个用于视频人脸增强的高效一步扩散框架，通过流匹配范式直接从退化输入映射到高质量输出，显著减少推理时间。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视频人脸增强方法面临的三个关键挑战：复杂面部纹理建模与时间一致性保持、由于高质量训练数据缺乏导致的模型泛化限制、以及推理过程中重复去噪步骤导致的低效率问题。

Method: 基于预训练的WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式利用强大的时空先验；提出联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，通过随机切换面部区域优化和全局重建，在潜在空间和像素空间提供显式监督；引入MLLM驱动的数据筛选流程自动选择高质量视频人脸数据集。

Result: 在感知质量、身份保持和时间稳定性方面达到最先进水平，同时提供实用的研究资源。

Conclusion: VividFace通过高效的一步扩散框架成功解决了视频人脸增强的关键挑战，在保持高质量输出的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Motivation: 现有基于模拟图像的SAR目标识别方法存在大量无关信息干扰，影响迁移信息质量。本文探索使用具有强物理意义和可解释性的前向散射中心模型来迁移更纯净的关键目标知识。

Method: 提出多层次异构知识迁移网络，包括任务关联信息选择器分离非信息知识、目标通用知识迁移模块使用最大判别散度度量函数、类别关系知识迁移模块利用类别关系一致性约束。

Result: 在由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的两个新数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移过程，确保了迁移的前向散射中心模型知识的完整性，有效解决了模拟数据与实测数据不平衡导致的优化偏差问题。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: 现有的基于Mamba的图像修复方法受到固定扫描模式和低效特征利用的限制，无法适应不同的退化类型，制约了修复性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出了两个关键创新：1) QCLAM使用FIFO缓存存储历史表示，通过相似性指导特征融合；2) GPS-SS2D使用Vision Transformer生成得分图估计像素重要性，采用贪心策略确定最优扫描路径。

Conclusion: VAMamba通过自适应特征学习和扫描策略，能够有效关注退化区域同时保持高计算效率，为图像修复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and
  efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration. Our

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现优异，但计算成本极高（单次扫描推理时间超过千秒），阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 在压缩潜在空间中通过感知优化的自编码器操作，使用基于注意力的条件U-Net进行快速确定性条件去噪扩散过程，大幅降低计算开销。

Result: 在LDCT和投影数据集上，模型实现了优越的感知质量，超越CNN/GAN方法，同时与DDPM和Dn-Dp等计算密集型扩散模型的重建保真度相当，推理速度比像素空间扩散去噪器快60倍以上，PSNR/SSIM指标保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了高保真度与临床可行性之间的差距，为医学成像中先进生成模型的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Result: 在780个概念对的基准测试中，在视觉质量、语义一致性和人类评分创造力方面优于强基线

Conclusion: VMDiff框架有效解决了图像融合中的共存和偏差问题，实现了更好的视觉融合效果

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功整合了LUT的效率、多先验和流匹配重建的特性，实现了高效且高质量的图像增强。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了3D场景中可移动人-物交互生成的挑战，为更真实的虚拟交互体验提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自校正能力，无法修正生成token中的错误，包括语法、拼写和逻辑错误

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有大多数MDVLMs，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为MDVLMs添加了自校正能力，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在运动理解和生成任务中存在模态干扰问题，且难以高效处理多流运动数据中的依赖关系。

Method: 使用残差量化的运动分词器将连续运动序列转换为多流离散标记；提出延迟并行建模策略，交错编码残差标记流；设计双塔架构分离运动与语言模态参数。

Result: 消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明在多种运动相关任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过创新的运动表示和建模策略，成功实现了高效的运动理解与生成，为运动相关任务提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的文本到图像扩散模型去偏方法，通过聚焦文本编码器微调和智能采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著改善公平性。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统综述了自动驾驶中拓扑感知感知的四个核心研究方向：矢量化地图构建、拓扑结构建模、先验知识融合和基于语言模型的感知，揭示了从静态预建地图向动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变。

Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性。需要转向动态的传感器驱动感知来实现实时地图构建和拓扑推理。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图构建）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构建模）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验知识融合）和基于预训练语言模型的多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些研究方向共同推动了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的转变，使自动驾驶系统能够实时构建地图并进行拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知感知的四个核心研究方向为构建更适应性强、可扩展且可解释的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路，实现了从静态地图到动态感知的范式转变。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的多图像布局控制方法，通过图像而非文本来指定内容，并提供精确的布局指导


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制限制了更精确的指导需求，需要同时定义内容和精确位置以实现更精细的控制

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考只需单张图像，提供对象和部件级别的显式简单控制

Result: 在各种图像合成任务中展示了有效性

Conclusion: 该方法实现了多图像布局控制，通过图像参考和布局指导提供精确的内容放置控制

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sparse-Up框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，结合表面锚定和视域分区技术，在保持多视角一致性的同时突破分辨率限制，有效保留高频细节并大幅降低内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视角一致性导致纹理撕裂，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而无法保留精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建确保多视角一致性；表面锚定采用可学习上采样策略将体素约束在网格表面，消除70%以上冗余体素；视域分区引入图像块引导的体素分区方案，仅在可见局部块上进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 显著降低高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗，同时保持几何一致性并保留纹理中的高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up框架通过创新的稀疏体素建模方法，有效解决了3D纹理重建中的高频细节保留与内存效率的平衡问题。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下新颖物体的鲁棒6D姿态估计问题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的光照不变颜色对特征表示，该特征为初始估计阶段提供RGB-D视图与物体3D网格之间的鲁棒配准，并为跟踪阶段验证时间对应关系，使轻量模型能够可靠回归物体运动。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使在突然姿态变化下也能保持性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架通过共享特征表示成功解决了6D姿态估计中的准确性与效率平衡问题，特别适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大严重阻碍推理效率，且许多令牌不重要可以安全剪枝。现有方法在效率和准确性之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层的注意力图估计令牌重要性，提出分层剪枝方法：全局保留阶段按区域保留高分令牌，局部保留阶段在窗口内保留最重要令牌。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B上分别减少TTFT达50.0%和55.1%，提升生成吞吐量达60.9%和47.3%，准确性未下降甚至在某些基准上有提升。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率，优于现有方法，证明了基于中间层注意力图的分层剪枝策略的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer模型在处理手术视频时计算成本过高，且现有token合并方法未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性

Method: 采用时空分离策略：时间维度通过显著性权重合并连续帧的对应空间token；空间维度通过时间稳定性分析优先合并静态token，保护动态区域

Result: 在训练自由的情况下实现超过65%的GFLOPs减少，同时在各种手术视频任务中保持竞争力精度，支持长序列手术视频的高效训练

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的token合并方法，有效解决了手术应用中的计算瓶颈问题

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法明确区分多模态大语言模型是依靠全局推理还是局部视觉线索获得成功，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向实际应用的模型开发。

Method: 通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，RCI能够揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解，还是可以通过部分或局部视觉线索解决。

Result: 将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准测试，发现大多数测试偏向局部推理并存在显著空间偏差，表明在现实应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了可操作的工具，用于诊断和缓解这些偏差，从而能够构建促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Method: 集成双向空间感知分支（捕获长程空间上下文依赖和复杂异构模式）与多尺度自蒸馏融合策略（增强层次特征表示和语义信息传递）。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba有效缓解了体积分割中二次计算复杂度的瓶颈，同时解决了全局感知不足的限制，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly

*Weilun Feng,Chuanguang Yang,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse是一个统一框架，结合模型量化和注意力稀疏化来压缩扩散变换器，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用量化或稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重性能下降。

Method: 提出多尺度显著注意力蒸馏（利用全局结构指导和局部显著监督缓解量化偏差）和二阶稀疏注意力重参数化（利用二阶残差的时间稳定性恢复稀疏化丢失的信息）。

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，大幅优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时实现3.68倍存储减少和1.88倍端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: QuantSparse框架成功解决了量化与稀疏化结合的挑战，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantSparse.

### [329] [HomeSafeBench: A Benchmark for Embodied Vision-Language Models in Free-Exploration Home Safety Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23690)
*Siyuan Gao,Jiashu Yao,Haoyu Wen,Yuhang Guo,Zeming Liu,Heyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，用于评估基于视觉语言模型的具身代理在家庭安全检查任务中的能力，包含12,900个数据点覆盖5种常见家庭安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键限制：1) 使用环境文本描述而非直接视觉信息，无法准确评估基于VLMs的具身代理；2) 使用单一静态视角观察环境，限制了代理的自由探索并可能导致遗漏某些安全隐患。

Method: 构建HomeSafeBench基准测试，提供来自模拟家庭环境的动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身代理自由探索房间，提供复杂环境中的多个动态视角。

Result: 对主流VLMs的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数仅为10.23%，表明当前VLMs存在显著局限性。模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面特别困难。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将很快公开。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

*Atharva Jadhav,Arush Karekar,Manas Divekar,Shachi Natu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用具有不同特征提取骨干网络的SSD模型集成来增强武器检测的鲁棒性，通过加权框融合方法显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全监控需要准确检测武器，但单模型检测器在部分遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3等不同骨干网络训练多个SSD模型，然后采用加权框融合方法整合这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 采用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的平均精度，比最佳单模型相对提升了2.948%，并持续优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明融合策略与集成多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提高集成检测精度的关键机制，为监控应用中的实时武器检测提供了鲁棒方法。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

### [331] [INSTINCT: Instance-Level Interaction Architecture for Query-Based Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23700)
*Yunjiang Xu,Lingzhi Li,Jin Wang,Yupeng Ouyang,Benyuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出INSTINCT框架，通过实例级交互解决协同感知中的带宽限制问题，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低通信需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协同感知系统虽然能克服单车感知在长距离检测和遮挡场景下的限制，但频繁的协作交互和实时要求带来了严格的带宽约束。现有基于查询的实例级交互方法在LiDAR协同感知中发展不足，性能仍落后于先进方法

Method: 1) 质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；2) 双分支检测路由方案解耦协作相关和无关实例；3) 跨智能体本地实例融合模块聚合本地混合实例特征；4) 增强GT采样技术以支持多样化混合实例特征训练

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上，准确率分别提升13.23%和33.08%，同时通信带宽降至现有最优方法的1/281和1/264

Conclusion: INSTINCT框架通过实例级交互和创新的组件设计，在协同感知中实现了性能提升与带宽降低的双重目标，为实际部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit是一个统一的扩散模型，通过联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，利用分类器自由引导技术，在单一模型中实现对象移除、效果控制和对象移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理对象效果（如阴影和反射）时使用反事实数据集训练的扩散模型，但在统一模型中应用分类器自由引导处理对象效果的性能影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入，在分类器自由引导方案中利用这些嵌入，增强对象及其效果的移除，并实现插入过程中对象效果的可控合成。

Result: CrimEdit实现了卓越的对象移除效果、可控的效果插入，以及无需额外训练或分离移除插入阶段的单步对象移动。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过统一模型和分类器自由引导技术，在对象编辑任务中实现了高效且高质量的性能，为复合编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病严重影响患者生活质量，当前诊断流程复杂且依赖神经科医生专业知识，导致早期检测延迟和及时干预机会错失。

Method: 引入MRI预处理模块减少变异性，整合脑区相关性先验和脑区老化先验知识，设计相关性先验引导特征聚合模块和年龄先验引导诊断模块。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识，实现了高效准确的帕金森病自动化诊断，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPCN是一个基于扩散模型的粗到精点云补全框架，通过两阶段方法：首先生成粗糙点云，然后通过点去噪和上采样进行细化，利用深度图像投影和条件扩散模型实现高质量点云补全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但由于点云的无结构和不规则特性，其在点云补全中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在利用扩散模型的强大生成能力来解决点云补全问题。

Method: 1. 将无序点云投影为结构化深度图像；2. 使用设计的DepthLDM合成多视角深度图像形成粗糙点云；3. 通过点去噪网络去除异常值；4. 使用关联感知点上采样器进行细化，生成密集高保真输出。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffPCN在几何精度和形状完整性方面达到了最先进的性能，显著提高了点云补全的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: DiffPCN通过结合扩散模型的生成能力和点云处理技术，成功解决了点云补全问题，为无序点云数据的高质量补全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频语言模型在长视频理解任务上的表现仍落后于图像或短视频任务，而现有方法通常需要引入新模块和额外复杂度。本文尝试通过最大化现有模型性能而非微调来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出训练免费、参数免费、模型无关的视觉提示策略，将多个视频帧组合成面板图像，平衡空间细节和时间分辨率，可无缝集成到现有视频语言模型中。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在不同模型架构、大小和上下文窗口下具有一致性。在TimeScope（长）数据集上，视频问答准确率最高提升19.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为长视频理解模型设立了新的性能基准，无需额外训练即可显著提升现有模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了M3DLayout数据集，这是一个用于3D室内布局生成的大规模多源数据集，包含15,080个布局和258k+对象实例，整合了真实扫描、CAD设计和程序生成场景，旨在解决现有数据集规模小、多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D室内布局生成模型受限于现有数据集的规模小、多样性不足和标注质量差，无法充分学习复杂空间和语义模式。

Method: 构建M3DLayout数据集，整合三个来源：真实世界扫描、专业CAD设计和程序生成场景，每个布局配有详细结构化文本描述，包括全局场景摘要、大型家具关系放置和细粒度小物品排列。

Result: 实验使用文本条件扩散模型建立基准，证明该数据集为布局生成模型提供了坚实基础，多源组合增强了多样性，特别是Inf3DLayout子集提供了丰富的小物体信息，能够生成更复杂详细的场景。

Conclusion: M3DLayout可作为推进文本驱动3D场景合成研究的有价值资源。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ方法，针对多模态大语言模型进行超低比特量化，通过层间选择性量化策略在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要巨大内存和计算资源，而现有的后训练量化方法主要针对纯语言模型，对多模态模型的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LUQ方法：1）分析发现多模态token具有更高统计方差和熵，对超低比特量化更敏感；2）识别不同层激活分布的差异性，选择性对耐受层应用超低比特量化；3）使用混合多模态token进行PTQ提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上评估，LUQ模型相比4位量化分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准上性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法成功实现了多模态大语言模型的超低比特量化，为资源受限环境下的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一种新颖的多尺度视觉Transformer标记器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，实现从低分辨率全局语义特征到高分辨率结构细节的渐进信息流。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样生成多尺度标记序列，并使用尺度因果注意力机制控制信息流动方向。

Result: 在相同设置下，多尺度标记器比单尺度方法在rFID指标上提升27.2%，在下游生成任务中收敛速度提升1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个多尺度ViT标记器，其平滑且均匀分布的潜在空间为视觉生成任务提供了重要进展。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点云，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，导致重建结果缺乏空间关联和全局一致性。

Method: 使用潜在状态作为空间记忆，设计基于Transformer的门控更新模块来重置和更新空间记忆；将场景划分为子图，在子图内进行局部对齐，并使用相对约束将所有子图注册到统一世界坐标系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架在保持实时性能的同时实现了优越的重建精度。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和全局一致性优化，显著提升了密集SLAM的重建质量和一致性。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ResAD++框架，通过残差特征和特征超球约束解决类无关异常检测问题，无需在目标数据上重新训练即可泛化到新类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单类和多类异常检测方法在新类别上表现不佳，主要原因是特征表示学习仍然与类别相关（特征相关性）。需要开发能够真正实现类无关泛化的方法。

Method: 1. 学习残差特征分布而非初始特征分布，通过匹配并减去正常参考特征实现特征去相关；2. 提出特征超球约束方法，将初始正常残差特征约束到空间超球中，使不同类别的特征尺度尽可能一致；3. 使用对数障碍双向收缩OCC损失和基于向量量化的特征分布匹配模块增强模型。

Result: 在8个真实世界异常检测数据集上的综合实验表明，ResAD++在新类别上直接使用时能取得显著的异常检测结果，优于现有最先进方法，也超越了基础版ResAD。

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征学习和特征尺度一致性约束，有效解决了类无关异常检测的泛化问题，为无需重新训练即可适应新类别的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Poivre方法，通过自我精炼过程（先标记、可视化、再精炼）和强化学习训练，显著提升视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务上的性能，在Point-Bench基准上超越现有最佳模型3%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务上表现远低于人类水平，主要限制是模型需要单步完成指向任务，类似于要求人类不看手指直接指向物体。

Method: 提出Poivre方法：1）自我精炼过程：先标记估计点，然后迭代精炼坐标；2）使用强化学习训练这种自我精炼能力；3）设计基于经验效果和理论性质的过程奖励机制。

Result: 训练的Poivre-7B模型在Point-Bench基准上创下新纪录，超越Gemini-2.5-Pro和Molmo-72B等专有和大规模开源模型3%以上。

Conclusion: 自我精炼过程和强化学习训练能有效提升视觉语言模型的视觉指向能力，为未来研究提供了训练代码、数据集和模型检查点。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得显著成功，但扩展到多模态任务时，现有方法依赖视觉语言模型或模块化设计，导致架构碎片化和计算效率低下。

Method: 提出UniAlignment统一框架，采用单一扩散变换器，引入双流扩散训练策略，包含内在模态语义对齐和跨模态语义对齐。

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UniAlignment优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 证明了扩散模型在统一多模态生成中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

*Xiaojie Li,Bei Wang,Jianlong Wu,Yue Yu,Liqiang Nie,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++是一个统一框架，通过多源自适应视图生成和质量驱动的对比学习机制，解决了对比学习中正样本对构建质量不足的问题，在视觉和视觉语言任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在正样本对构建方面存在多样性不足和语义破坏风险，在学习方面缺乏质量评估机制，导致所有样本对被同等对待，影响学习效果。

Method: 提出多源自适应视图生成机制，通过图像条件、文本条件和图像-文本条件三种策略动态调制生成参数，合成多样且语义一致的视图；同时引入质量驱动的对比学习机制，评估每对样本的语义对齐和多样性，动态重新加权其训练贡献。

Result: 在视觉表示学习中，将MoCov2在ImageNet线性分类上的性能提升+2.5%；在视觉语言学习中，在十个数据集上的平均零样本分类准确率比CLIP提高+12.31%，比SLIP提高+5.31%，Flickr30k文本检索R@5提升+3.2%。

Conclusion: GenView++通过改进正样本对构建质量和引入质量评估机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉语言任务上的性能，证明了该框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR是一个面向城市区域表示的多模态图建模框架，通过模态定制化图架构和空间感知融合机制，解决了现有方法在跨模态处理和空间异质性方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图模型在处理多模态城市数据时存在两个主要问题：(1) 对所有模态使用相同的图神经网络架构，无法捕捉模态特定结构；(2) 融合阶段忽略空间异质性，假设不同区域的模态聚合权重不变。

Method: 1. 将模态分为聚合级和点级两类，分别采用专家混合图架构和双级GNN处理；2. 设计空间感知多模态融合机制动态推断区域特定融合权重；3. 使用联合对比学习策略优化区域表示。

Conclusion: MTGRR通过模态定制化图建模和空间感知融合机制，有效提升了城市区域表示的质量，在多模态城市数据分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VQ方法存在较大量化误差，且使用代码级监督训练无法考虑最终重建误差，导致先验建模精度不足

Method: 纹理向量量化仅对缺失纹理建模，重建感知预测使用直通估计器以图像级监督训练索引预测器

Result: 提出的TVQ&RAP模型能以较小计算成本生成逼真的超分辨率结果

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VQ模型在视觉先验建模中的核心问题，为高质量图像重建提供了新思路

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的伪相关性的影响，这限制了模型在现实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)算法，使用组特定文本提示作为组代表，为每个目标类构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的组也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于微调整个网络的先前方法，而仅训练了网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升视觉语言模型的组鲁棒性，同时保持参数高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of

creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural

for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry

layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过共享表示和架构设计，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一，为物理世界的视觉语言建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

### [354] [2nd Place Report of MOSEv2 Challenge 2025: Concept Guided Video Object Segmentation via SeC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23838)
*Zhixiong Zhang,Shuangrui Ding,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了Segment Concept (SeC)框架在MOSEv2数据集上的零样本性能，该框架使用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，在复杂视频对象分割挑战中获得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半监督视频对象分割方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在视觉剧烈变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战下鲁棒性有限。需要更高层次的概念理解来提升分割的持久性。

Method: 采用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，实现更持久的分割。在MOSEv2数据集上进行零样本评估，无需在训练集上进行微调。

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上获得了39.7的JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过深度语义理解有效提升了视频对象分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性，在零样本设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了T23D-CompBench基准和Rank2Score评估器，用于解决文本到3D生成质量评估的挑战，通过大规模主观实验和两阶段训练方法提升评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成质量评估存在基准过时、分散且粒度粗，以及客观指标设计局限导致特征提取不具代表性和鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 构建包含5个组件12个子组件的T23D-CompBench基准，生成3600个纹理网格并收集129,600个人类评分；提出Rank2Score评估器，采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Result: Rank2Score在多个维度上持续优于现有指标，并能作为奖励函数优化生成模型。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D生成质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

*Michihiro Kuroki,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CE-FAM方法，通过融合激活映射提供概念解释，能同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其贡献，需要一种能利用VLM知识处理任意概念且无需标注数据的方法。

Method: 使用分支网络共享激活映射，学习模仿VLM嵌入，通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，量化其对分类的贡献。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念而无需标注数据。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

### [357] [FairViT-GAN: A Hybrid Vision Transformer with Adversarial Debiasing for Fair and Explainable Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23859)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个新颖的混合框架，结合CNN和ViT的优势，通过对抗性去偏机制解决面部美观预测中的架构限制、人口统计偏见和透明度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部美观预测方法存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度的问题。CNN擅长捕捉局部纹理但难以处理全局面部和谐，ViT能建模长距离依赖但可能忽略细粒度细节。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架，集成CNN分支用于局部特征提取和ViT分支用于全局上下文建模，并引入对抗性去偏机制使特征提取器产生与受保护属性无关的表示。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN在预测准确性上达到新水平（Pearson相关系数0.9230，RMSE 0.2650），公平性表现优异，种族亚组间性能差距减少82.9%，对抗者分类准确率降至接近随机水平（52.1%）。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了稳健、透明且显著更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR通过限制查询间的自注意力并添加查询-帧对齐，解决了DETR在时序语句定位中的性能异常问题，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现传统DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅无效，反而会降低性能，需要分析根本原因并改进。

Method: 在DETR解码器层进行两处小修改：1) 基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；2) 添加查询-帧对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: Sim-DETR充分释放了DETR在时序语句定位中的潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过分析DETR在时序语句定位中的异常行为并提出针对性改进，Sim-DETR成为该任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出信息引导指导（IGG）方法来解决自回归图像生成模型中的信息不一致问题，通过注意力机制将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，提高生成图像的质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在渐进分辨率缩放过程中，不同时间步的补丁之间存在信息不一致问题，导致引导信号分散、偏离条件信息，产生模糊和不忠实的特征。

Method: 提出信息引导指导（IGG）机制，通过注意力自适应地强化信息丰富的补丁，在采样过程中确保引导信号与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG能够生成更清晰、更连贯、语义更准确的图像，为基于自回归的方法设定了新的基准。

Conclusion: IGG通过将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，有效解决了自回归图像生成中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义保真度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

TL;DR: 提出了PCRI指标，用于系统量化多模态大语言模型对视觉上下文变化的鲁棒性，发现大多数先进模型对背景噪声敏感，只有少数模型表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉多模态大语言模型在真实场景中对无关视觉上下文的敏感性，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较局部图像块和完整图像输入的性能变化来量化模型鲁棒性，在19个先进模型和15个基准上进行评估。

Result: 大多数领先模型对背景噪声脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现一致鲁棒。

Conclusion: PCRI能够严格比较上下文鲁棒性，支持有原则的模型选择，并指导未来架构和训练策略的开发，以实现稳健的实际部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督3D目标检测的可学习伪标签选择框架，通过两个网络评估伪标签质量并确定自适应阈值，结合软监督策略在噪声下鲁棒学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督3D目标检测方法在伪标签选择上存在不足，要么依赖手动设置的固定阈值，要么仅使用部分网络信息而忽略上下文信息（如物体距离、类别、学习状态）。

Method: 在教师网络输出层引入两个网络，通过分数融合可靠评估伪标签质量并确定上下文自适应阈值，使用软监督策略在伪标签噪声下进行鲁棒学习。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能选择高精度伪标签，同时保持更广泛的上下文覆盖和更高的召回率，显著改进了相关SS3DOD方法。

Conclusion: 提出的可学习伪标签选择框架能自动、自适应地选择高质量伪标签，有效提升了半监督3D目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SuperDiff方法，通过自监督上下文子数据和可调泛化扩散模型解决低剂量CT重建问题，无需配对数据，在投影域和图像域双域策略下实现高质量重建和剂量泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖配对数据且泛化能力差，扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，而自监督方法在不同剂量间泛化性能显著下降。

Method: 设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，使用像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度。

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估显示，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能上始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SuperDiff仅需LDCT投影域数据进行训练和测试，实现了高质量重建和灵活的剂量泛化能力。

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个用于研究双手活动中手-身体协调效应的无标记3D手-身体基准数据集，通过多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合实现可靠的手部和上半身3D配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手活动天然涉及双手和身体的协调运动，但由于缺乏合适的数据集，这种协调性在活动理解中的影响尚未得到系统评估。现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手部或身体姿态，而基于标记的运动捕捉方法会引入视觉伪影。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿态标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合；验证了不同输入表示（视频、手部姿态、身体姿态或手-身体姿态）在基于图卷积或时空注意力的动作识别模型中的表现。

Result: 实验表明基于姿态的动作推断比视频基线更高效准确；联合建模手部和身体线索比单独使用手部或上半身能改善动作识别效果。

Conclusion: 建模相互依赖的手-身体动态对于全面理解双手活动至关重要，手-身体协调在动作识别中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘框架CCU，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离，解决视觉模态隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时实现高效遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用中视觉模态最易泄露隐私，现有遗忘方法会破坏跨模态知识并影响保留数据的类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能下降。

Method: CCU框架包含三个核心组件：选择性视觉遗忘（逆对比学习）、跨模态知识保留（语义一致性）、双集对比分离（隔离结构扰动）。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CCU相比最佳基线方法准确率提升7.12%，且仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU框架能有效解决视觉模态隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时实现高效遗忘，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Conclusion: 该频率域与量子信息结合的方法为构建智能、清晰且实用的医生辅助AI工具提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Abstract: The LifeCLEFs plant identification task provides a testbed for a
system-oriented evaluation of plant identification about 500 species trees and
herbaceous plants. Seven types of image content are considered: scan and
scan-like pictures of leaf, and 6 kinds of detailed views with unconstrained
conditions, directly photographed on the plant: flower, fruit, stem & bark,
branch, leaf and entire view. The main originality of this data is that it was
specifically built through a citizen sciences initiative conducted by Tela
Botanica, a French social network of amateur and expert botanists. This makes
the task closer to the conditions of a real-world application. This overview
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of task, summarizes the
retrieval approaches employed by the participating groups, and provides an
analysis of the main evaluation results. With a total of ten groups from six
countries and with a total of twenty seven submitted runs, involving distinct
and original methods, this fourth year task confirms Image & Multimedia
Retrieval community interest for biodiversity and botany, and highlights
further challenging studies in plant identification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于医学影像基础模型的持续学习框架，通过结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固，实现隐私保护且高效的模型适应，无需存储患者样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要随时间适应，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制。需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效适应的方法。

Method: 使用类别条件扩散重放与弹性权重巩固相结合的持续学习框架，采用紧凑的Vision Transformer骨干网络，在MedMNIST v2和CheXpert数据集上评估。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少超过30%的遗忘，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知的持续适应提供了一条实用路径，分析表明遗忘与重放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: 提出FedDA框架解决联邦学习中医疗图像模态异质性问题，通过特征级对抗学习对齐跨客户端特征，实现跨域联邦聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域联邦学习中，不同客户端可能拥有不同模态的医疗图像，这种异质性给跨域医学图像分割带来挑战。

Method: 提出联邦域适应(FedDA)分割训练框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间进行特征级对抗学习，对齐跨客户端特征图。

Result: 在三个医疗图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA能实现跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力，在客观和主观评估中均优于现有联邦聚合算法。

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效解决联邦学习中医疗图像模态异质性问题，提升模型在多个域上的泛化能力，缓解域偏移的负面影响。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了EditScore奖励模型系列，通过系统化的方法解决了图像编辑中缺乏高质量奖励信号的问题，实现了首个从基准测试到奖励建模再到RL训练的系统路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令引导的图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时面临挑战，且需要多次尝试才能获得理想结果。强化学习是潜在解决方案，但缺乏高质量、高效的奖励信号阻碍了其在图像编辑中的应用。

Method: 1) 开发EditReward-Bench基准测试系统评估奖励模型；2) 构建EditScore奖励模型系列(7B-72B)；3) 通过精心数据筛选和自集成策略优化模型性能；4) 将高质量奖励模型应用于在线RL训练。

Result: EditScore在基准测试中表现优异，最大变体甚至超越GPT-5。应用该框架到OmniGen2基础模型后，获得了显著且一致的性能提升，证明了高质量奖励模型对RL在图像编辑领域的重要性。

Conclusion: 高保真、领域专业化的奖励模型是解锁图像编辑中强化学习全部潜力的关键，本文提供了从基准测试到奖励建模再到RL训练的系统化路径。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Conclusion: MoReact模型在文本驱动的人类反应生成任务中表现出色，能够产生语义匹配的逼真运动序列，为计算机视觉和人机交互应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验分析发现多任务学习中优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数强相关，并提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略，可达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)旨在通过单一网络同时执行多个任务来构建通用视觉系统，但其潜力常因任务干扰导致的优化不平衡问题而受限，需要系统分析该问题的根本原因。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，研究现有优化方法在不同数据集上的表现差异，分析视觉基础模型(VFMs)和数据量的影响，并探索优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数的相关性。

Result: 发现现有优化方法在不同数据集上表现不一致，先进架构仍依赖昂贵的网格搜索损失权重；视觉基础模型提供强初始化但无法解决优化不平衡；增加数据量效果有限；优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数存在强相关性。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是比开发复杂方法更直接的多任务学习稳定路径，基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略可有效解决优化不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP模型在多任务对抗攻击中的跨任务迁移行为，发现细粒度任务生成的对抗样本具有更强的迁移能力，并提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架来增强对抗攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP作为通用视觉语言预训练模型在图像文本对齐任务中表现出色，但在细粒度任务和对抗鲁棒性方面存在不足。理解对抗样本在不同任务间的迁移机制对于评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出MT-AdvCLIP框架，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，强化细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多个任务平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

*Longtao Jiang,Mingfei Han,Lei Chen,Yongqiang Yu,Feng Zhao,Xiaojun Chang,Zhihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Token Painter，一种基于掩码自回归模型的免训练文本引导图像修复方法，通过双流编码器信息融合和自适应解码器注意力增强，解决了现有方法在文本对齐和背景一致性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像修复方法在潜在空间中建模整个图像，导致修复结果难以与文本提示细节对齐且难以保持背景一致性。掩码自回归模型虽然天然支持图像修复，但直接应用会忽略文本提示或与背景不协调。

Method: 提出Token Painter方法，包含两个关键组件：1）双流编码器信息融合（DEIF），在频域融合文本和背景的语义和上下文信息生成引导令牌；2）自适应解码器注意力增强（ADAE），自适应增强对引导令牌和修复令牌的注意力分数。

Result: 大量实验表明，这种免训练方法在几乎所有指标上都优于先前的最先进方法，并提供了更优越的视觉结果。

Conclusion: Token Painter通过创新的信息融合和注意力增强机制，有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的文本对齐和背景一致性问题，取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Motivation: 当前基于CARLA模拟器的闭环基准测试使用手动配置的交通场景，可能与真实世界条件存在差异，限制了反映实际驾驶性能的能力。

Method: 从100小时基础设施传感器视频数据集中提取800个动态交通场景，为15个真实世界交叉口创建静态数字孪生资产，在CARLA模拟器中实现基础设施合作。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合真实世界驾驶场景和基础设施合作，显著提高了自动驾驶系统闭环评估的真实性和挑战性。

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Motivation: 深度视觉网络将概念表示为潜在空间中的方向，但现有的矩阵分解、自编码器或字典学习方法依赖于特征重建，需要新的视角来更准确地恢复编码-解码方向对。

Method: 通过方向聚类识别解码方向，在概率视角下用信号向量估计编码方向，并利用网络权重通过不确定性区域对齐技术揭示影响预测的可解释方向。

Result: 在合成数据上恢复真实方向对；在真实数据上解码方向映射到单义可解释概念且优于无监督基线；信号向量能忠实估计编码方向。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效理解模型全局行为、解释个体预测，并可通过干预产生反事实或纠正错误，为深度网络的可解释性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Conclusion: AutoPrune通过复杂度自适应剪枝策略，有效平衡计算效率和模型性能，为视觉语言模型提供高效的推理优化方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车保险行业需要快速、准确且成本效益高的损伤评估方法。现有方法多局限于2D图像分析，而3D重建方法能提供更全面和几何精确的损伤表示，特别是3D高斯溅射技术能从有限视角生成准确连贯的3D重建。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

TL;DR: RLIR是一个后训练框架，通过逆动力学模型从生成视频中恢复输入动作，为视频世界模型提供可验证的奖励信号，显著提升了动作跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在视觉质量和时间一致性方面有所改进，但在准确模拟人类指定动作方面的能力仍待探索。强化学习是改进预训练模型动作跟随能力的有效方法，但传统方法由于大规模偏好标注成本高昂和基于规则的视频验证器不可行而难以应用。

Method: 提出RLIR框架，使用逆动力学模型从生成视频中恢复输入动作，将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过组相对策略优化提供可验证的奖励信号进行优化。

Result: 实验显示在自回归和扩散范式下，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量提升达10%，并获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，在多个指标上均取得显著改进。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Motivation: 甲状腺癌全球发病率上升，及时准确诊断对治疗策略和患者预后至关重要。

Method: 自适应CNN耦合CDF9/7小波，其细节系数通过n-scroll混沌系统调制以增强判别特征，使用5折交叉验证评估。

Result: 在DDTI数据集上达到98.17%准确率、98.76%灵敏度、97.58%特异性、97.55% F1分数和0.9912 AUC，混沌调制使准确率提升8.79个百分点。

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道实现了最先进的甲状腺超声分类，具有强大的泛化能力和适合临床集成的实用运行时特性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFSI方法通过基于能量的引导在扩散采样过程中强制执行物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通仿真的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通仿真虽然逼真，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹存在碰撞、偏离道路等问题，表明需要将物理有效性作为架构要求而非涌现属性。

Method: 提出Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI)，在扩散采样过程中通过基于能量的引导强制执行约束，将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数来引导去噪过程。

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset的200个城市场景中，VFSI将碰撞率降低了67%(24.6%到8.1%)，整体有效性提高了87%(50.3%到94.2%)，同时提升了真实感指标(ADE: 1.34m到1.21m)。

Conclusion: 模型无关的方法证明在推理过程中显式强制执行约束对于物理有效的交通仿真既是必要的也是充分的。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

TL;DR: OASIS是一种高效的一步扩散模型，通过注意力专业化路由和渐进式训练策略，解决了扩散模型在视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，实现了SOTA性能和6.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成扩散模型到视频超分辨率会产生冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，导致计算开销增加和学习负担加重。

Method: 提出注意力专业化路由，根据内在行为将注意力头分配到不同模式；采用渐进式训练策略，从时间一致退化到不一致退化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到SOTA性能，相比SeedVR2等一步扩散基线提供6.2倍加速。

Conclusion: OASIS通过减少冗余和有效保留预训练知识，使扩散模型更好地适应视频超分辨率任务，实现了高效高质量的重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

TL;DR: RPG360是一种无需训练的360度单目深度估计方法，利用透视基础模型和图优化来解决360度图像深度估计的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度图像在各领域的应用日益增多，但获取大规模标注数据集用于360度深度估计仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 将360度图像转换为六面立方体贴图表示，使用透视基础模型估计深度和表面法线，通过基于图的优化技术解决不同面之间的深度尺度不一致问题。

Result: 在Matterport3D、Stanford2D3D和360Loc等多个数据集上表现出色，并在下游任务中验证了其优势，如特征匹配（3.2-5.4%提升）和运动结构恢复（0.2-9.7%提升）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用基础模型的零样本鲁棒性和图优化技术，实现了无需训练的360度深度估计，并在多个数据集和下游任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Conclusion: SMART-R1通过简单的R1风格训练框架显著提升了基础模型的性能，为解决分布偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim

patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep

modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

TL;DR: FrameMind是一个端到端的视频理解框架，通过强化学习训练模型动态请求视觉信息，使用Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought交替进行文本推理和主动视觉感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型使用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，采用多轮交互方式，模型在文本推理和主动视觉感知之间交替，使用工具提取目标帧或视频片段。训练时使用Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling(DRFS)和DRFS-GRPO算法。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有模型，在灵活高效的视频理解方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态帧采样和强化学习训练，实现了更灵活高效的视频理解，解决了传统固定采样策略的局限性。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略无法很好地泛化到高光谱图像，因为高光谱图像具有高维性和复杂的光谱结构。

Method: 采用原型子空间建模，每个类别用一组基向量表示形成子空间表示，并施加基向量正交性和重构约束来指导学习。

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法。

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境下的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础，证明了原型子空间建模在高维特征空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合大气散射物理先验和行人关系拓扑建模的深度学习模型，用于雾霾天气下的行人轨迹预测，在能见度<30m的浓雾场景下相比SOTA模型显著降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雾霾天气条件下物理信息退化和行人交互建模无效的问题，为智能交通系统在恶劣环境下的可靠感知提供新范式。

Method: 1) 构建可微分大气散射模型解耦雾霾浓度和光线退化；2) 设计自适应扫描状态空间模型进行特征提取；3) 开发异构图注意力网络建模多粒度行人交互。

Result: 在浓雾场景下，minADE/minFDE指标分别降低37.2%和41.5%，推理速度相比原生Mamba提升78%。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣环境下智能交通系统的可靠感知提供了新的建模范式，在雾霾天气行人轨迹预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer数据上学习图像重建，相比传统的ISP处理后sRGB图像重建方法，能获得更优的重建效果，并引入了新的评估指标ICS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP处理会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围和模糊细节，这些损失是可以避免的。

Method: 使用原始Bayer马赛克直接学习重建；创建Raw-Rain基准数据集；引入信息守恒评分(ICS)作为新的评估指标；比较ISP后和Bayer重建流程。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型将sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快，计算量减半。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持低层视觉采用ISP后处理范式，为端到端可学习相机管线打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一端到端框架，联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类，通过反馈机制实现聚类感知的分割，在HSI数据集上达到最先进精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超像素方法独立于聚类任务进行分割，导致分割结果与后续聚类目标不一致；传统子空间聚类计算和内存成本高，难以扩展

Method: 端到端联合优化框架，包含基于展开ADMM的自表示网络和可微分超像素模块，通过反馈机制实现聚类感知分割，每个超像素学习独立的紧凑度参数

Result: 在基准HSI数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的聚类方法始终获得更优的准确率

Conclusion: 联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类能产生聚类感知的分割，同时保持光谱和空间结构，实现更灵活自适应的分割

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型虽具可迁移性，但计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，但下游任务往往未知，因此需要研究数据对剪枝的影响。

Method: 研究预训练视觉模型剪枝过程中数据的作用，探索基于一个任务剪枝后模型在未见任务上的表现，并通过微调验证性能恢复能力。

Result: 发现基于一个任务的剪枝能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能，微调这些剪枝模型不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复未见任务的性能。

Conclusion: 大规模数据集上的广泛预训练创造了有利的损失景观，使得剪枝后的模型具有良好的泛化能力和性能恢复潜力。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型视觉语言模型中通过外部视觉结构（如分区和标注）提升性能的内部机制，提出了Grounding IDs的概念，这些潜在标识符通过外部线索诱导，能在多模态间绑定对象到指定分区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在结构化推理和精确接地方面仍有限制。现有研究表明添加简单视觉结构能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过表示分析研究外部视觉结构如何诱导Grounding IDs，这些标识符在嵌入空间中表现为分区内对齐，并减少图像和文本之间的模态差距。使用因果干预验证这些标识符在对象与符号线索绑定中的中介作用。

Result: 研究发现Grounding IDs增强了相关组件之间的注意力，从而改善了跨模态接地并减少了幻觉。这些标识符作为稳健的分区内对齐在嵌入空间中出现。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，既提供了可解释性，又在实际应用中提高了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

TL;DR: VideoAR框架挑战了传统逐帧视频生成方法，提出使用时空立方体作为预测单元，在时空维度同时进行自回归预测，显著提升视频生成质量、速度和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑帧是否是视频自回归的合适预测单元，传统方法将语言模型的token预测扩展到视频时域，但帧作为原子单元可能不是最优选择。

Method: 提出VideoAR统一框架，支持多种预测单元：完整帧、关键细节帧、多尺度精化和时空立方体，其中时空立方体方法允许模型在时空维度同时进行自回归预测。

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最佳，超越现有方法在VBench上的表现，推理速度更快，并能扩展到分钟级长序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作激励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方式，打破了逐帧预测的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩展输入规模和改进压缩策略，有效解决了RVOS中的关键挑战，实现了高性能和效率的平衡。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

Motivation: 解决GUI中自然语言查询定位的挑战，需要模型理解多样化的UI元素并准确预测空间坐标。受人类视觉搜索过程的启发，设计协同框架来提升性能。

Method: 提出GMS框架，包含五个阶段：通用VLM作为'Scanner'识别感兴趣区域，专用定位模型作为'Locator'输出精确坐标，采用分层搜索和跨模态通信实现粗到细的定位。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，单独Scanner和Locator模型准确率仅为2.0%和3.7%，但GMS框架整合后达到35.7%的准确率，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GMS框架通过协同利用通用和专用模型的优势，有效提升了GUI定位性能，展示了其在通用GUI定位任务中的鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Motivation: 揭示AI系统即使从看似平衡的数据源也可能引入偏见，特别是面部美感预测中的种族偏见问题，警告AI在塑造审美规范中的作用。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验、Dunn事后分析）和跨数据集验证，评估预测公平性。

Result: 两个模型在不同种族群体间都表现出显著预测差异（p < 0.001），只有4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均等标准，算法放大了社会审美偏见。

Conclusion: 当前AI美感预测方法存在不足，需要开发缓解策略来实现公平的美感技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在视频超分辨率中虽已实现单步采样，但推理效率仍有很大优化空间，需要进一步降低计算成本。

Conclusion: FastVSR在保持性能的同时显著提升了视频超分辨率的推理效率，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Abstract: The early and accurate classification of brain tumors is crucial for guiding
effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study
presents BrainFusion, a significant advancement in brain tumor analysis using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by combining fine-tuned convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) for tumor classification--including VGG16, ResNet50, and
Xception--with YOLOv8 for precise tumor localization with bounding boxes.
Leveraging the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, our experiments reveal that the

Motivation: 解决青少年特发性脊柱侧弯(AIS)评估中，无辐射方法在矢状面对齐评估方面的不足，现有研究主要集中在冠状面评估。

Method: 采用双阶段架构：先估计侧位脊柱结构，再合成X光片。引入基于注意力的快速傅里叶卷积模块和空间变形网络，并构建了3264对RGBD和侧位X光片配对数据集。

Result: LatXGen生成的X光片在解剖学上准确，在视觉保真度和定量指标上都优于现有的基于GAN的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了一种有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的全面评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本的信息价值特别具有挑战性。现有方法难以有效感知细粒度图像之间的独特性。

Method: 引入多方面的信息度量方法：1）差异-混淆不确定性量化局部特征融合时的类别方向性和结构稳定性；2）对不确定性样本进行加权聚类；3）校准多样性以最大化所选样本的全局多样性同时保持局部代表性。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集上的26个不同实验设置中，该方法相比最先进方法取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DECERN方法通过结合不确定性和多样性度量，能够有效选择信息丰富的样本，在细粒度图像分类的主动学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 由于隐私问题，医学图像分析中获取大规模3D数据集具有挑战性，现有生成模型在输出多样性方面存在局限，无法准确表示3D医学图像。

Method: 结合GAN生成肿瘤掩膜和扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，以放射组学特征作为生成条件，放射组学特征是高维手工语义特征，具有生物学基础。

Conclusion: 该方法能够移除、操作和重新定位肿瘤，在不同场景下生成各种肿瘤类型，在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理包含描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其属性和关系，导致频繁的误检。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1）构建层次化合成标注数据集；2）Talk in Pieces模块通过解构损失函数将文本嵌入分解为对象、属性和关系三个子空间；3）See in Whole模块学习将解构的组件聚合为层次化结构嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入层次化语言结构归纳偏置，TaSe框架能够生成细粒度的多模态表示，显著提升基于语言的目标检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

TL;DR: 开发了一种高效的3D深度学习框架T1C-RFlow，能够从多参数MRI生成T1对比增强图像，避免了钆基对比剂的使用风险，并显著提高了生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中常用于增强病灶可视化，但对有肾源性系统性纤维化风险的患者存在限制，且对比剂使用的不一致性会影响成像质量。

Method: 提出3D潜在整流流模型，首先将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像输入预训练自编码器获得潜在空间表示，然后在该潜在空间中训练整流流扩散模型。

Result: T1C-RFlow在各项指标上优于基准模型，生成速度快（6.9秒/体积），在胶质瘤、脑膜瘤和转移瘤数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的合成T1C图像与真实图像高度相似，且生成时间显著缩短，为脑肿瘤的无对比剂MRI提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Conclusion: UniVid通过创新的架构设计有效解决了统一视频建模中的关键挑战，在视频理解和生成任务上都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型（如SAM）在医学图像分割中由于缺乏领域特定适应而表现不佳的问题，同时需要在临床实践中以最小资源需求高效微调模型。

Method: 1. 互补细节增强网络（CDEN）使用深度可分离卷积和多尺度融合捕捉边界敏感特征；2. 在ViT块中集成低秩适配器优化医学上下文特征表示和注意力；3. 在掩码解码器中采用低秩张量注意力机制。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM通过边界感知和低秩自适应策略，有效解决了SAM在医学图像分割中的领域适应问题，实现了高效且高性能的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Motivation: 情感视频面部分析领域数据有限，且缩放特性对多模态学习的影响尚未充分探索，需要更好的跨模态相关性建模方法。

Method: 采用双掩码策略，增强模态编码器设计，引入迭代音频-视觉相关性学习模块，以及渐进式语义注入的三阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++通过创新的双掩码策略和相关性学习模块，有效解决了AVFA领域的缩放和跨模态建模挑战，为情感分析系统提供了强大基础。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global

dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional

assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External

competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了两种无需训练的推理时技术，通过充分利用显式动作参数来改进基于扩散的机器人视频生成，提高动作连贯性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频是构建有效世界模型和机器人基础模型的关键步骤，需要更好地利用动作参数来指导生成过程。

Method: 1. 动作缩放的无分类器引导：根据动作幅度动态调节引导强度，增强对运动强度的控制；2. 动作缩放的噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地匹配期望的运动动态。

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用动作参数来指导扩散生成过程，可以有效提升机器人视频生成的动作控制能力和生成质量。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)新范式，直接在视觉嵌入空间进行自回归推理，相比传统方法在语言空间推理有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法仍将视觉信息视为静态前提，推理局限于语言空间，无法充分利用视觉信号。

Method: 视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的语义空间，训练语言模型生成能重构关键视觉标记的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理。

Result: 在感知密集型视觉问答任务上取得显著提升，MMVP数据集达到71.67%，优于Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%。

Conclusion: LVR通过直接在视觉空间推理，显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专为多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)设计的图像编解码器CoTAM，通过自适应保护多级特征来适应下游任务的不同需求，相比传统编解码器节省35.99%的比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编解码器针对人类视觉系统优化，不适合MLLMs处理多种下游任务的需求，需要专门针对MLLMs的压缩技术来减少边缘设备到云端的带宽使用。

Method: 提出CoTAM编解码器：编码器利用CLIP浅层注意力生成重要性图进行比特分配，保护关键语义区域；解码器集成轻量级适配器和多级损失函数，确保低层细节和高层语义的忠实重建。

Result: 实验验证该方法在保持MLLM任务性能的同时，实现了高达35.99%的比特率节省，优于先前的最先进神经编解码器。

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应保护多级特征，有效解决了传统编解码器在MLLMs应用中的局限性，为边缘到云端的MLLM部署提供了高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管二进制SNN在能效方面具有优势，但在大规模网络中仍面临存储和计算需求大的挑战，需要进一步探索压缩和加速潜力。

Method: 1) 利用训练好的二进制SNN中的核聚类模式建立S²NN基线；2) 提出异常值感知的亚比特权重量化(OS-Quant)方法，通过识别和自适应缩放异常值来优化码字选择；3) 提出基于膜电位的特征蒸馏(MPFD)方法，通过教师模型提供更精确的指导。

Result: 在视觉和非视觉任务上的广泛结果表明，S²NN在性能和效率方面都优于现有的量化SNN。

Conclusion: S²NN在边缘计算应用中具有广阔前景，能够有效平衡性能和效率需求。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Conclusion: CDM中的循环策略是改进基于扩散的医学图像生成的有效方法，在数据增强、反事实生成和疾病进展建模中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架的鲁棒点云配准框架SRRF，通过引入抗干扰的骨架表示来提升配准的鲁棒性和准确性，在多种干扰场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对这些干扰敏感，配准精度下降。

Method: 集成骨架结构到配准过程中，结合从损坏点云对齐及其骨架对齐获得的变换来实现最优配准，并设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多种损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种干扰场景下（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实世界3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和7Scenes等3D视觉数据集上的实验表明，CEGC在准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: CEGC为具有挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

TL;DR: ASIA是一个基于少量图像标注的自适应3D分割框架，能够分割3D模型中的非语义和非文本可描述部件，通过利用文本到图像扩散模型的先验知识实现从图像空间到3D空间的分割迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D分割中标注数据获取困难的问题，相比多视角图像、3D模型标注和文本描述，使用少量野外图像标注更易收集、标注要求更低且更精确。

Method: 优化每个分割片段的文本token，使用新颖的跨视角部件对应损失微调模型，在推理时通过多视角渲染、UV空间投票融合、噪声优化技术实现3D分割。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中均显著优于现有方法，为语义和非语义3D分割任务提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高质量的3D分割，特别是在处理几何或结构差异较大的对象时表现出色，为3D分割任务提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: SVGThinker为设计、内容创作和自动化图形生成开辟了新方向，其输出支持精确和分层编辑，优于基于图像的方法。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在长视频理解中存在均匀帧采样和静态文本推理的低效问题，难以处理视觉密集型视频任务。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用监督微调建立基础动作能力，然后通过强化学习优化策略决策，并对每个动作和格式奖励进行深入设计探索。

Conclusion: FrameThinker框架在长视频推理中实现了无与伦比的效率和效果，建立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前方法在室内无纹理重建中的局限性，实现了更准确的几何重建。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 利用几何投影和三平面融合，将多相机特征整合到统一地面平面，提取单视角特征并通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: 实验显示TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，在密集遮挡场景中达到95.1%的准确率和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在智能农业中的实际应用潜力，特别是在密集遮挡场景下的动物计数任务。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR通过在固定半径超球面上约束AR输入和输出来解决VAE潜在空间中异质方差问题，稳定自回归解码过程，在ImageNet生成任务中创下了AR模型的新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续标记自回归模型在图像生成中表现不如潜在扩散和掩码生成模型，主要原因是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在自回归解码过程中被放大，特别是在分类器无关引导下会导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，将所有AR输入和输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE，通过超球面约束移除尺度分量来稳定AR解码。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务中，SphereAR-H（943M参数）达到FID 1.34，创AR模型新SOTA；SphereAR-L（479M）达FID 1.54，SphereAR-B（208M）达1.92，均优于或匹配更大规模的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次纯下一标记自回归图像生成器在光栅顺序下，在可比参数规模上超越扩散和掩码生成模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自反思自改进的多智能体框架，用于解决农业视觉问答中多图像输入和外部知识不足的问题，在AgMMU基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业视觉问答方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像输入和外部农业知识的真实场景，且缺乏系统性的质量控制和适应能力。

Method: 采用四角色多智能体框架：检索器负责获取外部信息，反思器评估信息充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器并行生成候选答案以减少偏差，改进器通过迭代检查优化答案并整合多图像信息。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该自反思自改进的多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和外部知识需求，通过角色协作实现了上下文增强、反思推理和迭代改进。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

*Yixuan Ren,Hanyu Wang,Hao Chen,Bo He,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一个隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频。该模型将视频压缩为统一的神经网络表示，在隐式权重空间进行扩散生成，避免了传统方法中的跨帧注意力计算，实现了高效高质量的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频生成方法通常将视频编码为逐帧特征图，存在计算效率低和跨帧一致性差的问题。NeRV-Diffusion旨在将视频整体压缩为统一的神经网络表示，通过生成神经网络权重来实现更高效和高质量的视频合成。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）基于超网络的标记器将视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2）隐式扩散变换器在隐式INR权重上进行去噪。通过重用瓶颈潜在变量、改进权重分配和上采样连接，以及引入SNR自适应损失加权和计划采样来训练模型。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion达到了优于先前基于INR模型的质量，并与最先进的非隐式模型性能相当。同时提供了平滑的INR权重空间，支持帧间或视频间的无缝插值。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion证明了通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频的可行性，提供了一种高效且高质量的隐式视频生成方法，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

TL;DR: 提出LamFormer网络用于多器官医学图像分割，通过线性注意力Mamba模块和降维Transformer解决传统Transformer计算成本高和局部细节提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系，但忽略了其高计算成本和局部细节信息提取不足的问题。

Method: 采用U型网络结构，在增强金字塔编码器中使用线性注意力Mamba捕获多尺度长距离依赖；构建并行层次特征聚合模块聚合不同层特征；设计降维Transformer全局建模上采样特征。

Result: 在七个复杂多样的数据集上优于现有分割方法，表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: LamFormer在模型性能和复杂度之间实现了良好平衡，是多器官医学图像分割的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种通过主动破坏梯度共识来增强对抗鲁棒性的随机集成防御方法，它训练轻量级可学习滤波器来强制梯度不协调，在保持自然预测的同时实现显著的鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，大多数防御方法在梯度可被可靠估计时就会失效。研究发现梯度共识是导致对抗可转移性的关键因素，攻击者利用这种共识构建跨变换有效的扰动。

Method: 提出DRIFT防御框架，包含：(1) 形式化梯度共识并提供理论分析；(2) 提出共识-分歧训练策略，结合预测一致性、雅可比分离、对数空间分离和对抗鲁棒性；(3) 训练随机集成滤波器来主动破坏梯度共识。

Result: 在ImageNet上对CNN和Vision Transformer都实现了显著的鲁棒性提升，在自适应白盒攻击、基于转移的攻击和无梯度攻击下，优于最先进的预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法。

Conclusion: DRIFT以可忽略的运行时间和内存成本实现了这些改进，确立了梯度分歧作为对抗防御的实用且可泛化的原则。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各领域广泛应用，但在UI理解准确性和UI生成质量等特定领域任务中仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调(SFT)结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)增强细粒度UI理解，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)生成人类偏好的UI，并提出工业级有效工作流程。

Conclusion: 集成理解和生成任务可以同时提高两者的准确性和质量，证明了统一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的X形架构，解决了统一多模态模型中视觉和文本之间的梯度冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时实现了优越的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重的梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这是由于图像和文本的低层统计特性根本不同导致的。

Method: Uni-X采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层专用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数用于高层语义融合。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了优越的训练效率。当扩展到3B参数时，其性能匹配或超越7B参数的自回归统一多模态模型，在图像生成、文本和视觉理解任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构，有效解决了多模态训练中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了R²M框架，通过模型融合解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新伪造生成器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，使得数据收集和重复训练变得不切实际，需要一种能够持续适应新威胁的解决方案

Method: R²M框架：通过低秩分解估计共享真实成分，将专家模型分解为真实对齐部分和伪造残差，使用层间秩截断去噪残差，并通过每任务范数匹配聚合

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他融合基线方法

Conclusion: R²M具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家模型并重新融合，无需重新训练整个系统

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 亚米级分辨率遥感影像提供了精细的地物细节，但由于缺乏高质量标注数据集，其在大规模土地覆盖制图方面的潜力未能充分发挥。现有标注方法通常不可靠或成本过高。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，提出MCAE方法，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多个实例的同时高效标注。

Conclusion: MCAE展示了在大规模亚米级分辨率制图中的可扩展性和实用价值，HiCity-LC是首个公开可用的亚米级分辨率城市级土地覆盖基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的教学视频包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这违反了传统对齐方法的强单调性假设。现有方法如OPEL仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 使用正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输(R-FPGWOT)，联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，结合序列间对比学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，并产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN能够有效处理教学视频中的噪声和乱序问题，在程序学习任务中显著优于现有方法，同时保持关键步骤顺序并过滤噪声。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple

(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

TL;DR: Vid-LLM是一种基于视频的3D多模态大语言模型，无需外部3D数据输入，通过视频直接处理实现3D场景理解，在3D问答、密集描述和视觉定位任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D多模态大语言模型依赖3D数据输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。为了解决这一局限，提出无需外部3D数据的视频基3D-MLLM，使其更适合实际部署。

Method: 设计跨任务适配器模块对齐3D几何先验与视觉语言表示，引入度量深度模型从重建输出中恢复真实尺度几何，采用两阶段蒸馏优化策略进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中的广泛实验验证了该方法在3D问答、3D密集描述和3D视觉定位任务上的有效性，展示了优越的多任务能力。

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过直接处理视频输入实现了高效的3D场景理解，无需依赖外部3D数据，具有更好的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCICF框架，用于系统识别和分类弱势道路使用者（VRU）情境，支持自动驾驶出租车（robotaxi）的运营设计域（ODD）事故分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶出租车的商业部署，需要可靠检测弱势道路使用者（如行人、自行车骑手等）。端到端AI系统需要高质量数据来训练和评估，特别是在ODD内。

Method: 基于SMIRK合成数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK数据集，使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）将多维场景特征转换为特征模式，并与MoreSMIRK中的条目匹配。

Result: 在包含150多个手动标注行人穿越视频的PIE数据集上评估，PCICF能够成功识别和分类复杂的行人穿越情境，即使当行人群体合并或分离时。

Conclusion: PCICF通过计算高效的组件（如SFCs）具有在自动驾驶出租车上用于ODD检测的潜力，并提供了开源复现包。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view

spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

*Kai Liu,Shaoqiu Zhang,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器（DiTs）的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现几乎无损的视觉生成质量，同时获得3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）虽然提升了视觉生成质量，但模型规模和复杂性限制了其在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化（PTQ）作为高效模型压缩技术，可以减少内存消耗和加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: CLQ包含三个关键设计：1）交叉块校准（CBC）获取准确的校准数据；2）正交平滑（OBS）量化通道异常值并使用块Hadamard矩阵平滑异常值；3）跨层参数搜索（CLPS）进行参数搜索。

Result: 在图像生成和视频生成模型上评估CLQ，成功将模型压缩到W4A4量化，视觉质量和指标几乎没有下降。实现了3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ是一种有效的DiTs量化方法，能够在保持高质量视觉生成的同时显著减少内存消耗和加速推理，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个系统评估图像数据集质量的流程，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具并引入自动阈值选择，显著提升了低质量图像检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域缺乏系统性的数据集质量评估研究。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集识别质量问题，开发结合CleanVision和Fastdup的流程，引入自动阈值选择方法，将低质量图像检测建模为二分类任务。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下将F1分数从0.6794提升至0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升至0.8557；去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升至0.7928。

Conclusion: 不同质量问题对模型影响程度不同，CNN对模糊和严重下采样等遮蔽关键特征的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程有效提升了数据质量评估效果。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS是一种新颖的3D高斯泼溅方法，通过引入代理系统实现遮挡感知，显著减少渲染冗余，在保持高质量的同时加速渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法虽然能实现逼真渲染，但存在大量冗余计算，特别是缺乏遮挡感知能力，导致在遮挡严重场景中效率低下。

Method: 使用快速代理系统生成精确遮挡深度图，指导锚点和高斯函数剔除以加速渲染，并在训练时引导密度化过程避免遮挡区域不一致。

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，Proxy-GS不仅提升了MLP基高斯泼溅的渲染能力，还实现了超过2.5倍的渲染加速，渲染质量显著提高。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过遮挡感知机制有效解决了3DGS中的冗余问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时大幅提升效率，为大规模场景渲染提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计，无法有效处理模态差异和几何错位问题，需要更明确的监督和优化策略。

Method: 提出解耦优化策略，分别训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；引入几何感知数据合成流程和异常鲁棒损失；使用跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，显著提高了光流预测精度。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束，有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异和几何错位问题，在无监督方法中表现出色。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了UI2V-Bench基准测试，专注于评估图像到视频生成模型的语义理解和推理能力，填补现有评估主要关注视频质量和时间一致性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成评估基准主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，而忽视了模型对输入图像特定主题语义的理解能力，以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识。

Method: 设计了四个主要评估维度：空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理；基于多模态大语言模型开发了两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解管道和基于反馈的推理管道。

Result: 构建了约500个精心设计的文本-图像对，评估了开源和闭源的图像到视频模型；人类评估与提出的MLLM指标高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench通过强调语义理解和推理能力，填补了图像到视频评估的关键空白，为该领域未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需世界构建概念的启发，旨在创建可交互的3D虚拟环境，其中只有用户主动探索的区域才以高视觉真实感渲染。

Method: 使用混合场景结构：对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，同时对背景和未交互区域进行2D合成以确保效率。结合先进的表示学习和对象到3D技术，支持灵活视角操作和物理合理的场景动画。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法，能够提供动态、沉浸式且视觉一致的探索体验。

Conclusion: NeoWorld框架成功实现了按需生成交互式3D虚拟世界的能力，通过渐进式3D细节展开和自然语言控制，为用户提供了前所未有的沉浸式探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

Motivation: 传统视频问答模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉视频的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题改写(QBP)将现有问答对合成为重建视频事件结构的叙事段落；问题字幕(QBC)为每个问题生成细粒度的视觉依据。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一个token预测目标下训练模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上验证，显著提升准确率并创下新SOTA：3B模型在STAR上达到72.5%(+4.9%)，7B模型在NExT-QA上达到80.8%。QBP和QBC都大幅增强了跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还使模型收敛速度提升2.5倍以上。

Conclusion: 从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和有依据的推理的数据合成方法，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了可解释和表达性的人类运动生成控制，通过Laban运动分析提供了细粒度的运动质量控制。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Result: 经过Euclid30K训练后，所有评估模型在VSI-Bench上的平均准确率从34.5%提升至40.5%，提升了5.5个百分点。其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%准确率，超越了之前的SOTA模型Spatial-MLLM。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明，以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型赋予广泛可迁移的空间技能，在四个空间推理基准测试中均实现了显著的零样本性能提升。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

*Julio Hurtado,Haoran Ni,Duygu Sap,Connor Mattinson,Martin Lotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种选择性表示框架，通过聚类和核心集选择方法将二手服装图像数据库压缩至原大小的10%，同时保持检索准确性。引入基于邻域同质性一致性评分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非代表性样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要贡献者，促进二手市场发展具有重要意义。机器学习方法在大规模评估二手服装价值方面发挥重要作用，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 1. 使用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，捕捉服装关键特征和内部变异性；2. 引入基于邻域同质性一致性评分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非特征性样本。

Result: 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上的评估显示，该方法在保持接近最优精度的同时，通过减少添加到向量数据库的图像数量，大幅降低了计算成本。异常值去除方法应用于聚类技术时，通过去除非判别性样本，进一步提高了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该选择性表示框架通过战略性修剪和选择代表性图像向量，在性能与效率之间实现了良好平衡，为二手服装市场的可扩展图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

TL;DR: 提出了语义课程偏好优化（SCPO）框架，通过渐进式课程学习、动态参考模型和双向对称目标来解决多模态大语言模型的视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉幻觉问题上表现不佳，现有DPO方法无法捕捉细粒度语义差异且容易导致捷径学习。

Method: 构建语义课程偏好对数据集，按难度排序提供细粒度语义对比；使用动态参考模型和双向对称目标进行训练。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，SCPO将幻觉率降低了高达62.9%，同时在通用基准测试中保持性能稳定。

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的MLLM对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在模态依赖不平衡问题，当主导模态在真实场景中退化时，整体性能显著下降。模态平衡成为实际多模态分割的关键挑战。

Method: 基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块(CMTB)，实现高效多模态融合和分层选择；设计自引导模块(SGM)，通过相互引导机制缓解模态不平衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过均衡模态编码和自引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: QL-Adapter是一个用于多对象图像编辑的框架，通过融合布局先验和跨模态增强来解决复杂场景中对象数量和空间布局的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多对象场景中的图像编辑经常失败，需要解决对象数量、空间布局约束和多样化类别的挑战。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：图像-布局融合模块（ILFM）将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；跨模态增强模块（CMAM）将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入并改进指令跟随。

Result: 在QL-Edit任务上的广泛实验表明，QL-Adapter实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过有效的布局融合和跨模态增强，成功解决了复杂场景中多对象编辑的挑战，在数量和布局一致性图像编辑方面表现出色。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

*Zheyuan Hu,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在扩散模型预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提高训练稳定性和效率，实现更少步骤的高质量图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型（如一致性模型和平均流）虽然能实现少步生成，但训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。即使从预训练扩散模型初始化，仍存在将无限小步转换为长跳跃映射的不稳定性问题。

Method: CMT是一个紧凑且原理性的中间训练阶段，训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，产生轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：CIFAR-10两步FID 1.97，ImageNet 64x64两步FID 1.32，ImageNet 512x512两步FID 1.84。相比一致性模型节省98%训练数据和GPU时间，相比平均流从零开始训练减少约50%总训练时间。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原理性、高效且通用的框架，解决了训练不稳定问题，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进掩码生成和语义编码策略，有效提升了3D场景理解的性能，为具身AI和机器人提供了更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文首次对Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种生成模型进行了统一的理论和实验验证，证明了Diffusion Bridge在成本函数上更低，能引导系统走向更稳定自然的轨迹；而Flow Matching在训练数据减少时效率下降。


<details>

Motivation: 解决Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种方法在理论框架和实践实现上的显著差异，澄清哪种方法更优的问题，为这两种流行的生成模型提供统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过随机最优控制理论重新构建两种框架，证明Diffusion Bridge的成本函数更低；从最优传输角度分析Flow Matching的插值系数问题；提出基于潜在Transformer的新型Diffusion Bridge架构，并与相同结构的Flow Matching模型进行公平比较。

Result: 在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、转换和风格迁移等任务上的全面实验表明，Diffusion Bridge在分布差异较大时表现更好，Flow Matching在数据充足且任务简单时有一定优势，实验结果与理论预测完全一致。

Conclusion: Diffusion Bridge在稳定性和轨迹自然性方面优于Flow Matching，特别是在训练数据有限和任务难度较高的情况下；而Flow Matching在数据充足且任务相对简单时具有一定效率优势。两种方法各有适用场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，有效提升了雾天环境下人群计数的准确性，为解决复杂气象条件下的计算机视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，它通过破坏模型对物体关系的理解能力，而非强制生成固定目标内容，从而更难被检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测。TokenSwap旨在开发更隐蔽的攻击方法，利用模型对物体关系理解能力的弱点。

Method: 在训练时注入视觉触发器并同时交换文本答案中关键token的语法角色，使用自适应token加权损失来强调交换token的学习，将视觉触发器与bags-of-words行为关联。

Result: 实验表明TokenSwap在多个基准测试和不同LVLM架构上实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的隐蔽性和隐匿性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap证明了针对LVLM组合理解能力的后门攻击的有效性，揭示了现有防御机制的局限性，需要开发更强大的防御方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Motivation: 在开放环境中，机器人会遇到未知物体，需要语义理解来泛化到已知类别及之外的物体。传统方法依赖离散类别标签，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征与逼真训练数据，通过交叉注意力注入连续语义先验，使用点法线噪声模型减少Sim2Real差距，学习跨物体实例的规范化坐标系。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，SCOPE在5°5cm指标上相对改进31.9%，在两个实例级数据集上展示了对未知类别的泛化能力，抓取成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验实现了对已知和未知类别的有效泛化，在物体姿态估计任务中超越了现有最佳方法。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull

*Fankai Jia,Daisong Gan,Zhe Zhang,Zhaochi Wen,Chenchen Dan,Dong Liang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMRQA框架，通过多模态大语言模型结合信号处理技术，解决MRI质量评估中的数据稀缺和协议变异问题，实现可解释的高精度质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI质量评估方法存在根本性权衡：基于信号的方法缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法牺牲可解释性。需要结合定量分析和语义推理来提升临床实用性。

Method: MMRQA框架包含三个创新：1) 通过MRQy增强模拟伪影的鲁棒性指标提取；2) 使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对；3) 通过LoRA参数高效融合LLaVA-OneVision。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力，并通过全面消融研究验证。

Conclusion: 该框架通过桥接定量分析和语义推理，生成临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制能力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

*Mohamad Abou Ali,Mariam Abdulfattah,Baraah Al Hussein,Fadi Dornaika,Ali Cherry,Mohamad Hajj-Hassan,Lara Hamawy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了YOLOv11模型在细粒度外周血涂片检测中的表现，创建了包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大型数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观，深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等先进模型在细粒度PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大型标注数据集，包含12个外周血细胞类别和红细胞类别；全面评估5个YOLOv11变体（从Nano到XLarge），采用两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10），使用mAP、精确率、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等多重性能标准。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934；大型模型（Large和XLarge）仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加；8:1:1分割在所有模型中始终优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11，特别是Medium变体，是自动化细粒度PBS检测的高效框架；公开发布的数据集为血液学中血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化最优传输(SOT)的无监督框架，用于精英标枪投掷运动中的运动阶段分割，无需昂贵的人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析方法依赖人工标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种能够自动提取相关动力学变量的鲁棒性时间分割方法。

Method: 使用结构化最优传输(SOT)概念增强基于注意力的时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)，实现无监督的运动阶段转换识别。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度(mAP)和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无监督方法。同时发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种有效的无监督分割解决方案，特别适用于标枪投掷等需要精确生物力学阶段分析的运动项目。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

*Yuhan Zhu,Xiangyu Zeng,Chenting Wang,Xinhao Li,Yicheng Xu,Ziang Yan,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练即可实现强大的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器，这限制了它们的通用性和实用性。

Method: FreeRet采用两阶段检索：首先直接从模型获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态大语言模型经过精心利用后，无需训练即可作为强大的检索引擎，填补了其作为通用模型的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类策划基准，用于评估事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，要求重新排列片段以形成连贯序列。评估显示视觉语言模型在事件推理上远不如人类，且更依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在事件推理方面存在不足，需要专门的基准来评估其在时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理等多维度的能力。

Method: 从COIN教学视频数据集中筛选3,381个视频，分为12个类别和180个子类别，分割成11,423个事件片段。通过重新排列片段的任务评估人类和视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Result: 人类表现显著优于视觉语言模型。模型在时间因果推理主导的视频上表现相对较好，在上下文空间推理主导的视频上表现较差。日常任务表现优于专业任务。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在事件推理方面仍有显著差距，特别是在视觉理解而非语言先验方面。需要进一步改进模型的多维推理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RIFLE框架，首个专门研究显示屏闪烁条纹（flicker-banding）去除的方法，通过潜在扩散增强技术有效消除拍摄屏幕时出现的明暗交替条纹，同时保留图像细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拍摄发光显示屏时经常出现闪烁条纹现象，严重影响可读性和感知质量，但该问题尚未得到充分研究，而莫尔条纹已有大量研究。

Method: 提出RIFLE框架，包含闪烁条纹先验估计器（FPE）预测条纹属性并注入修复网络，使用掩码损失（ML）集中监督条纹区域，提供模拟管道生成合成数据，包括条纹角度、间距和宽度的随机抖动。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的定量指标和视觉比较显示，RIFLE在从轻微到严重闪烁条纹情况下均优于现有图像重建基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究闪烁条纹模拟和去除的工作，为后续数据集构建和去除模型设计奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SlotAdapt框架，将预训练扩散模型适配为面向对象的生成模型，在保持全局场景连贯性的同时实现解耦的对象控制，适用于图像和视频的合成、编辑等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流扩散模型将图像视为整体处理，依赖于文本条件，这与对象级编辑需求存在不匹配。需要开发能够表示场景为离散对象组合的AI系统，实现细粒度的可控图像和视频生成。

Method: 1. 图像：SlotAdapt在预训练扩散模型中集成轻量级的基于槽的条件机制，使用寄存器token处理背景/风格，槽条件模块处理对象；2. 视频：使用不变槽注意力(ISA)分离对象身份与姿态，结合基于Transformer的时间聚合器保持跨帧的对象表示和动态一致性。

Result: 在对象发现、分割、组合编辑和可控图像生成方面达到最先进水平；在无监督视频对象分割和重建方面建立新基准；支持对象移除、替换和插入等高级编辑任务，无需显式监督。

Conclusion: 该工作为图像和视频的面向对象生成建模建立了通用且可扩展的方法，通过连接人类基于对象的感知与机器学习，扩展了交互式、结构化和用户驱动的生成工具在设计空间中的应用。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven

requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and
Imagenet1K.

Motivation: 开放词汇伪装目标分割需要模型分割训练期间未见过的任意类别伪装目标，对泛化能力要求极高。现有方法中的分类组件显著影响整体分割性能。

Method: 采用分类器中心的自适应框架，通过轻量级文本适配器和新型分层非对称初始化来改进分类组件。

Result: 在OVCamo基准测试中，相比OVCoser基线方法，cIoU从0.443提升至0.493，cSm从0.579提升至0.658，cMAE从0.336降低至0.239。

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为推进伪装目标分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Conclusion: 开发高精度的TBI病变分割方法对于可靠的神经影像分析至关重要，该研究提出的自动化分割管道在挑战赛中表现优异。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: SANA-Video是一个小型扩散模型，能够高效生成720x1280分辨率、分钟级时长的视频，具有快速生成速度，可在RTX 5090 GPU上部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、生成速度慢的问题，实现低成本、高质量的视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制（Linear DiT）和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和模型训练策略。

Result: 相比现代最先进的小型扩散模型，性能相当但速度快16倍，训练成本仅为MovieGen的1%，在RTX 5090上生成5秒720p视频从71秒加速到29秒。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，为视频生成技术的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖从大规模文本-视频数据集中隐式学习物理推理，这种方法成本高、难以扩展，且容易产生违反物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 采用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导(SDG)策略，包括同步方向归一化来对抗滞后抑制，以及轨迹解耦去噪来减轻累积轨迹偏差。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提升了物理保真度，同时保持了照片真实感，且无需额外训练。消融研究证实了物理感知推理组件和SDG的互补有效性。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的即插即用物理感知视频生成范式，能够有效抑制不合理内容并提升物理合理性。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Result: 在28个大视觉语言模型上的实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅36.35%，功能正确性得分24.39%远低于视觉保真度得分64.25%，表明当前模型在时序动态推理和事件驱动逻辑合成方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究建立了一个具有挑战性的前沿基准，揭示了当前模型在理解动态交互和生成功能代码方面的关键局限性。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

*Luis F. W. Batista,Tom Bourbon,Cedric Pradalier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了偏振成像在水面漂浮碎片分割中的效果，通过PoTATO数据集对比了偏振融合网络与单图像基线模型，发现偏振线索能提升分割精度但增加计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受水面反光和室外光照变化的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来抑制水面反光干扰。

Method: 在PoTATO公共数据集上对最先进的偏振融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行性能比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的假阳性，相对于RGB输入提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差，但增加了模型大小和计算负载。

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究者判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于分析患者在不同临床就诊期间病情变化的时间医学基准TemMed-Bench，评估大型视觉语言模型在时间医学图像上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊的图像分析，与真实临床实践中医生参考患者历史病情进行综合评估的做法不符。

Method: 构建包含三个任务（视觉问答、报告生成、图像对选择）的测试集和超过17,000个实例的知识语料库，评估6个专有和6个开源LVLM。

Result: 大多数LVLM缺乏分析时间医学图像中病情变化的能力，在闭卷设置下多数表现仅达到随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有差距。多模态检索增强显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时间医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个越南语多模态医学数据集，包含156.7万对CT-PET图像和2757份完整临床报告，解决了医学AI中PET/CT成像数据和低资源语言越南语代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型在成像模态多样性和多语言临床数据方面存在局限，特别是在PET/CT功能成像和越南语等低资源语言上代表性不足，限制了模型的泛化能力和临床实用性。

Method: 构建了大规模的越南语CT-PET图像与临床报告配对数据集，并引入包含数据增强和专家验证测试集的训练框架来增强视觉语言模型的学习能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，将本数据集整合到现有视觉语言模型中，在医学报告生成和视觉问答等下游任务上显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试将推动医学影像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境，并提升其在越南医疗中的临床相关性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本GSM8K数据集系统映射为视觉形式构建，包含1,319个高质量样本，评估显示现有VLM在视觉数学推理方面仍有很大改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准多局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估多图像推理能力，需要填补这些空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合人工标注，将文本GSM8K数据集系统映射为视觉形式，构建GSM8K-V基准。

Result: 评估显示现有VLM在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍是挑战。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和泛化VLM的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法在复杂场景中表现有限，主要原因是输入模态不足。为了解决这一局限性，作者探索利用三种互补模态来提升跟踪性能。

Method: 提出了RDTTrack跟踪器，利用预训练的RGB跟踪模型和提示学习技术。通过正交投影约束融合热红外和深度模态，然后将其与RGB信号整合作为预训练基础跟踪模型的提示。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在复杂场景下的跟踪精度和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有的双模态方法。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪方法能够有效整合互补信息，在复杂场景中实现更鲁棒的目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，通过统一通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter，实现了3D高斯溅射的极端压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时达到100倍以上的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场景表示(如3DGS)虽然能实现高质量神经渲染，但其大存储和传输成本阻碍了在资源受限环境中的部署。现有压缩方法要么依赖昂贵的优化，要么在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。

Method: UGC执行无需重新优化的剪枝来减少高斯基元，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化，从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。采用轻量级VAE和一步扩散设计实现实时恢复。

Result: 该框架能实现超过100倍的压缩(从354.77MB压缩到约3.31MB)，同时保持保真度并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Result: 实验表明VTPerception-R1显著提高了推理准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在较小模型中效果更明显。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于感知的多模态推理提供了可扩展且可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: SkyLink方法通过创新的数据增强、特征聚合和3D场景信息整合，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的语义退化问题，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Motivation: 解决长视频理解中统一帧采样机制导致的时空感知冲突问题，避免牺牲时间线索或空间细节的次优解。

Method: 提出自适应缩放模型，先提供小分辨率密集采样帧，通过多步推理逐步放大感兴趣片段，使用3.8万高质量CoT数据微调，并通过解耦强化微调优化内部缩放能力。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1相比基线Qwen2.5-VL平均提升3.1%，实现了采样密度和帧分辨率之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 自适应缩放机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时空感知冲突，多步推理和过程监督是提升模型性能的关键。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 深入理解多模态大语言模型中视觉处理的具体机制，探索视觉功能在不同解码层的分布规律，为模型优化和应用提供理论基础。

Method: 提出视觉令牌交换分析框架，通过修改特定KV缓存条目来精确揭示解码过程中各层的具体功能。开发VFL-LoRA选择性训练方法和VFL-select数据自动分类方法。

Result: 发现视觉功能层在不同MLLMs中呈现一致深度顺序模式（识别→计数→定位）。VFL-LoRA在性能上优于全LoRA训练，且防止域外功能遗忘。VFL-select仅用20%数据即可达到98%全数据性能，超越人类专家数据选择效果。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，为开发更高效、可解释和鲁棒的模型提供了新思路和方法，在模型优化和数据选择方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而缺乏明确的因果结构，无法一致地将属性效应传播到因果依赖项。需要一种能够精确控制语义属性并减少虚假相关性的方法。

Method: 使用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入（对齐因果属性与文本嵌入）和条件令牌对比损失（解耦属性因子）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能：Pendulum数据集MAE降低91%，ADNI数据集FID降低87%，实现高保真MRI图像生成。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Result: 在ModelNet40和ModelNet10合成基准测试中分别达到99.05%和99.52%的准确率，在真实世界OmniObject3D数据集上表现稳健，在10种不同类型的噪声ModelNet40输入下展现出强韧性。

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑特征提取和轻量级CNN，实现了3D物体分类的新SOTA性能，在合成和真实数据集上都表现出优异的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极其无约束的野外2D照片重建高保真3D穿衣人像，直接处理原始非结构化照片，无需清洁输入或交叉视图校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要"清洁"输入（如全身图像、无遮挡或良好校准的交叉视图）的限制，直接处理现实中变化多样的原始照片。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效将无约束输入转换为清洁正交多视图图像；提出姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA）选择性融合多参考图像信息；使用感知器式多参考形状预测器，无需预捕获身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕获数据上的实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%、P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%、LPIPS-46%）上均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: UP2You高效（1.5分钟/人）、多功能（支持任意姿态控制和免训练多服装3D虚拟试穿），适用于现实世界中随意拍摄的人类照片场景。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\ours的训练无关视觉token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感度，选择高敏感度且互补的视觉token，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型推理成本高，现有token剪枝方法存在局限性：基于注意力的方法不稳定且冗余，基于多样性的方法可能丢弃重要区域。

Method: 使用零阶扰动在投影层估计token敏感度，选择高敏感度且互补的视觉token，无需训练且计算轻量。

Result: 在多个VLMs和基准测试中表现优异，可剪枝高达94.4%的token，保持准确性的同时实现2.30倍端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视觉token冗余问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出PHASE-Net，一种基于物理原理的轻量级rPPG模型，通过Navier-Stokes方程推导出血流动力学理论，使用TCN网络结构，在头部运动和光照变化下实现鲁棒的非接触生理监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG深度学习方法大多缺乏理论依据，在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 基于Navier-Stokes方程推导出脉搏信号遵循二阶动力系统，设计PHASE-Net模型，包含零计算量轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控TCN三个关键组件。

Result: PHASE-Net在广泛实验中达到最先进性能，具有强效率和部署就绪性。

Conclusion: PHASE-Net提供了一个理论支撑且部署就绪的rPPG解决方案，通过物理信息范式提升了非接触生理监测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

TL;DR: ELPG-DTFS是一种基于脑电图的抑郁症诊断模型，通过通道-频带注意力、可学习邻接矩阵和残差知识图路径，实现了97.63%的准确率和97.33%的F1分数，超越了现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观量表，而脑电图提供了低成本生物标志物，但现有深度学习方法将频谱视为静态图像，固定通道间图结构，且忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出先验引导的自适应时频图神经网络ELPG-DTFS，包含：(1)通道-频带注意力与跨频带互信息；(2)动态功能连接的可学习邻接矩阵；(3)注入神经科学先验的残差知识图路径。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超过2025年最先进的ACM-GNN。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1降低高达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于脑电图的下一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的框架，各模块具有互补价值。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制启发，探索生物启发的输入预处理方法，以提升语义分割模型在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 在RGB、灰度图和颜色对立通道上应用DoG滤波来增强局部对比度，这种预处理方法模型无关且轻量级。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持正常条件下性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种模型无关的轻量级预处理方法有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但在实时流媒体场景中由于历史视觉特征存储限制和实时时空推理不足而效果有限。

Method: 提出StreamForest架构，包含持久事件记忆森林（自适应将视频帧组织为事件级树结构）和细粒度时空窗口（捕获详细短期视觉线索），并创建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%。在极端视觉token压缩（1024个token）下仍能保持默认设置下96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流媒体视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，为实时视频分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境上下文的新型扩散模型，能够通过文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合来生成卫星图像，解决了现有方法在环境上下文有限、数据缺失和用户意图反映方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用时面临环境上下文有限、数据缺失或损坏、以及难以可靠反映用户意图的问题，需要一种能够更好利用多模态信息的方法。

Method: 使用环境上下文条件化的扩散模型，结合三种控制信号（文本、元数据、视觉数据），采用元数据融合策略处理部分损坏或缺失的观测数据，是首个将动态环境条件作为控制信号的卫星图像生成方法。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成试验中，该方法在定性和定量评估（使用6个不同指标）上都优于先前方法，表现出对缺失元数据的鲁棒性、对控制输入的高响应性，以及更高的保真度、准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件化能够提高卫星图像基础模型的性能，该模型有望在下游任务中应用，同时构建了首个公开可用的三模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于同步校准的RGB-热成像图像对稀缺，阻碍了视觉-热成像传感器融合和跨模态任务的发展，因此需要开发RGB到热成像图像转换方法，从丰富的RGB数据集中合成热成像图像用于训练。

Method: 提出ThermalGen自适应流基生成模型，包含RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，收集了8个公开的卫星-航空、航空和地面RGB-T配对数据集，并引入了3个新的大规模卫星-航空RGB-T数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中的广泛评估表明，ThermalGen实现了与现有GAN基和扩散基方法相当或更优的转换性能。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是第一个能够合成反映显著视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的热成像图像的RGB-T图像转换模型。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and

on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure

Motivation: 虽然对抗攻击在判别模型中被广泛研究，但针对生成管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些能在输入中植入微小扰动来控制输出变化的攻击方法。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，制作隐蔽触发器；通过感知和频域分析评估隐蔽性；在ControlNet引导编辑中测试方法可迁移性。

Result: 实验显示毒化输出可能比干净输出具有更高的视觉质量，挑战了毒化必然降低保真度的假设；潜在空间毒化可以保留甚至增强输出美学。

Conclusion: 精心优化的扰动可以在生成器输出中产生一致且隐蔽的效果，同时保持视觉上的不明显，这对图像生成管道的完整性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将视觉语言模型和数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了主动域适应的效果。

Method: DAM框架通过初始化稳定的ViL引导目标，并采用双向蒸馏机制在迭代适应过程中促进目标模型与双重监督之间的知识交换。

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中，DAM始终优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DAM框架成功整合了多模态监督和人工标注，为源自由主动域适应提供了有效的双重监督解决方案。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估的新型深度学习框架，通过预测椎体上下终板角度和坐标，结合生物力学约束和SVD分析，实现了高精度的脊柱侧弯诊断和新型椎体楔形变指标的量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间变异，影响诊断准确性。现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取。使用奇异值分解直接分析椎体形态的角度预测，无需预设曲线假设。

Result: 在630张全脊柱前后位X光片上达到83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55度的平均绝对误差。框架在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的椎体楔形变指数与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无相关性，为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Surgery是一个高效框架，可将预训练视频扩散模型中的注意力机制线性化或混合化，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力机制存在二次计算复杂度问题，导致长序列和高分辨率视频生成计算成本高昂。

Method: 结合软注意力和线性注意力的混合注意力机制，配合轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，以及成本感知的块率策略来平衡表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用后，注意力计算成本降低高达40%，在VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了具有竞争力的次二次注意力视频扩散模型，为高效视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏系统结构和现实应用所需的挑战性场景，限制了统一多模态模型的性能发展。

Method: 结合层次化任务分类和自动化数据生成方法，利用结构化资源池和GPT-4o构建包含11个主要领域、51个子任务的80k高质量指令-图像对。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升，编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键因素。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体

Method: SID方法：首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹，通过迭代自改进流程提升智能体性能

Result: 在REVERIE和SOON等任务上实现最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%成功率，比之前最佳方法提升13.9%

Conclusion: SID方法通过自我改进演示显著提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性能，可扩展到新环境并迁移到各种语言引导导航任务

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器或回归器，在结构特定干预（如改变左肺面积）时效果不足，会产生不希望的全局影响，且需要用户提供难以获得的像素级标签图。

Method: 提出Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT)，通过分割器引导的反事实微调，在保持对标量值结构特定变量干预简单性的同时，生成局部一致且有效的反事实图像。

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法能够有效生成结构特定的反事实图像，避免了传统方法的局限性，为医学图像分析和疾病建模提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络（GANs）的可扩展性，借鉴其他生成模型成功的设计选择，解决GAN在扩展过程中遇到的挑战。

Method: 1. 在VAE潜在空间中训练以提高计算效率；2. 采用纯transformer架构的生成器和判别器；3. 引入轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整来解决扩展问题。

Result: GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上实现了单步、类条件生成的SOTA性能（FID为2.96），仅需40个epoch，比强基线少6倍训练周期。

Conclusion: 通过潜在空间训练和transformer架构，结合适当的扩展解决方案，GAN可以可靠地在各种容量范围内训练，并实现优异的生成性能。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和稀疏的任务相关信息，现有LLM方法难以同时保证信息捕获的完整性和效率。

Method: 采用多粒度感知代理(MGPA)模拟人类视觉注意机制捕获任务相关信息，验证增强反思代理(VERA)验证关键线索并优化感知策略，通过交互循环探索最小化但可靠的任务相关线索集。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进式视觉认知的交互框架，有效解决了长视频理解中效率与准确性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像等高风险领域，深度学习模型的精确置信度估计至关重要，过度自信的错误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 开发定制CNN并在合并脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声（高斯、泊松、椒盐、散斑、均匀），使用温度缩放进行后处理校准。

Result: TS在所有噪声条件下显著降低ECE和NLL，同时不降低分类准确率，证明其能有效提升模型输出的可靠性。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是一种有效且计算高效的方法，能增强医疗AI系统的决策置信度，使模型在噪声或不确定环境中输出更可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略场景中的人类，且缺乏标注的人-环境关系数据，同时现有方法通常只能从单帧图像中捕捉开放词汇关系，限制了建模超出观察内容的远程交互能力。

Method: 开发了Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类及其属性、活动与环境的关系（包括本地和远程关系），并创建了包含合成环境和全面人-场景关系标注的新基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法提高了人类活动预测能力和对人-环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发具有社会智能的机器人铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

<details>

Motivation: 事件相机在低光照和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且事件数据缺乏空间信息和标注数据集。

Method: 使用CMFA融合RGB数据指导事件特征提取，同时采用SSMER从无标注事件数据中学习有效特征。

Result: 在真实E-SIE数据集和合成WFLW-V基准测试中，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了事件数据空间信息有限和标注不足的问题，实现了更准确的人脸关键点对齐。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent

channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过预测关键点热图在SD U-Net的潜在空间中，保持生成先验，并在跨域基准上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法如Marigold和Lotus主要关注密集预测，而SDPose旨在充分利用扩散先验进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的图像潜在空间中预测关键点热图，保持原始生成先验；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射到关键点热图；3. 引入辅助RGB重建分支以防止过拟合并增强域外鲁棒性。

Result: 在COCO验证集上仅使用Sapiens五分之一训练时间即达到同等性能，在HumanArt和COCO-OOD跨域基准上创下新纪录，并在可控生成任务中作为零样本姿态标注器表现优异。

Conclusion: SDPose有效利用了预训练扩散模型的先验知识，在人体姿态估计任务中展现出强大的跨域泛化能力和实用性，特别是在零样本姿态标注方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Motivation: 现有方法受限于窄视场或相机可控性不足，无法生成连续完整的360度可探索视觉世界，限制了用户或自主代理的自由探索。

Method: 首先在虚拟3D环境中模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径数据集；然后提出球面感知扩散Transformer架构，将等距柱面特征重投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面表现优异，显著提升了视觉保真度和时空连续性。

Conclusion: 该框架在生成高保真可控全景视频方面具有优势，展现了在现实世界应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Local View Transformer (LVT)用于大规模场景重建和新视角合成，通过局部邻域处理避免标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度难以扩展到大规模场景，而空间邻近的视图比远距离视图能提供更多有用的局部场景信息

Method: 使用局部视图Transformer处理每个视图周围的局部邻域信息，采用基于相对几何变换的新型位置编码，输出解码为包含颜色和透明度视图依赖性的3D高斯泼溅场景表示

Result: LVT能够在单次前向传播中重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景

Conclusion: Local View Transformer为大规模场景重建和新视角合成提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对数字广告和营销工作流中大量未标注图像的处理需求，开发一个无需训练、易于复现的无监督分割基线方法。

Method: 使用DINO自监督ViT编码器提取图像块特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上达到具有竞争力的mIoU和像素精度，与近期无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP的零训练设计使其成为处理大规模未标注图像语料库的强大且易于复现的基线方法，特别适用于品牌安全筛查、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核等应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

Motivation: 虽然强化学习在自然图像领域展现了强大的推理能力，但其在地球观测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。地球观测任务面临独特挑战，需要任务感知的推理能力。

Method: 提出了一个后训练框架，通过整合任务感知奖励来适应推理型强化学习模型，使其能够有效处理各种地球观测任务。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将强化学习推理能力扩展到地球观测领域，为处理复杂的遥感图像任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

TL;DR: STAGE是一个用于自回归图像生成的稳定强化学习框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励解决GRPO算法中的梯度冲突和策略熵不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法在自回归图像生成中存在训练不稳定、破坏预训练模型能力、图像质量下降和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出STAGE框架：1）优势/KL重加权：相似性感知的重加权缓解冲突更新；2）熵奖励：基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，STAGE相比基线GRPO在视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: STAGE通过缓解token间冲突和稳定训练过程，减少了预训练分布的破坏，改善了泛化能力并更好地迁移到其他基准测试。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出VT-FSL框架，通过跨模态迭代提示和几何对齐，将LLM生成的精确类别描述与支持图像结合，解决少样本学习中语义幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法因缺乏实际实例基础而产生与视觉证据矛盾的语义幻觉，导致噪声指导和昂贵修正。需要构建精确的跨模态提示来改善这一问题。

Method: 1. 跨模态迭代提示(CIP)：基于类别名称和支持图像条件化LLM，迭代生成精确类别描述；2. 跨模态几何对齐(CGA)：通过最小化三维平行六面体的核化体积，联合对齐融合的文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个多样化基准测试中（包括标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景）建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available

Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能与图像采集能力同步扩展，需要解决大规模配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 开发IO感知的非GEMM融合内核，结合分布式框架，优化非GEMM瓶颈并实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Result: FFDP将现有最优化和深度学习配准流水线加速6-7倍，峰值内存消耗降低20-59%，在单个GPU上可处理比现有SOTA大64倍的问题。

Conclusion: FFDP在大规模图像配准方面实现了前所未有的能力，在性能和效率方面均显著优于现有最先进的图像配准方法。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜的大规模数据集使得3D重建计算昂贵且内存密集。传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销呈立方增长。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅技术，用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质（每个高斯仅11个参数），并设计了新颖的梯度计算方法来减少内存占用和训练成本。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM实现了高达48%的训练加速和12%的内存使用降低，同时局部分辨率提高了38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

TL;DR: MANI-Pure提出了一种基于幅度谱的对抗净化框架，通过频率自适应的噪声注入来有效抑制对抗扰动，在保持语义内容的同时提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，会破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且在不同频率和攻击类型中具有异质性强度模式。

Method: MANI-Pure利用输入的幅度谱来指导净化过程，自适应地应用异质、频率定向的噪声，有效抑制脆弱的高频低幅度频带中的对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，MANI-Pure将干净准确率差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒准确率提高2.15，并在RobustBench排行榜上获得top-1鲁棒准确率，超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应噪声注入有效解决了对抗净化中的关键问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文将分数蒸馏（SiD）技术扩展到预训练的文本到图像流匹配模型，证明了分数蒸馏方法在流匹配模型中的普适性，无需教师微调或架构更改即可实现加速生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但受限于缓慢的迭代采样过程。流匹配框架在理论上与高斯假设下的扩散模型等价，但此前不确定蒸馏技术是否能直接应用于流匹配模型。

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导，统一了高斯扩散和流匹配框架，并将分数身份蒸馏（SiD）扩展到预训练的文本到图像流匹配模型，包括SANA、SD3-Medium、SD3.5-Medium/Large和FLUX.1-dev等DiT骨干模型。

Result: 实验表明，只需对流匹配和DiT进行适度调整，SiD就能在这些模型中直接工作，在无数据和有数据辅助的设置下都有效，无需教师微调或架构更改。

Conclusion: 这首次系统证明了分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流基生成器的加速技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to

*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了F³（快速特征场）方法，用于从事件相机数据构建表示，通过预测未来事件来学习场景结构和运动信息，并在多个视觉任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够有效处理事件相机稀疏数据的表示方法，利用事件数据的时空特性来捕捉场景结构和运动信息，同时保持对噪声和事件率变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用多分辨率哈希编码和深度集合的思想，将事件数据表示为连续时空体积内的多通道图像，通过预测未来事件来学习F³表示。

Result: 在三个机器人平台（汽车、四足机器人、飞行平台）上，在不同光照条件（白天、夜晚）、环境（室内、室外、城市、越野）和动态视觉传感器下，在光流估计、语义分割和单目度量深度估计任务中获得了最先进的性能，在HD分辨率下预测速度可达25-75 Hz。

Conclusion: F³方法能够高效处理事件相机数据，在多种视觉任务中表现出色，为事件相机的实际应用提供了有效的表示学习框架。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上，从而提升多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然受限。研究发现这种限制源于注意力机制：视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法跨帧一致地识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 将稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达性与Transformer中的注意力机制建立新颖联系，提出VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可锚定注意力到共享的视觉结构。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升，例如在InternVL2-8B和Qwen2.5VL-72B上，VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）分别提升了3.2%和4.6%。定性分析显示了更一致的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过子空间亲和性有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的注意力偏差问题，为提升模型的视觉理解能力提供了一种有效的即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing方法解决流式视频生成中的错误累积问题，通过联合去噪、注意力锚点和高效训练算法，实现高质量、低延迟的长视频流生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法在长时序上存在严重错误累积问题，导致生成视频质量显著下降，需要开发能够最小化错误累积的新技术。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧而非逐帧采样；2. 注意力锚点机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展的去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: 在单GPU上实现实时多分钟视频流生成，显著减少错误累积，生成高质量、时序连贯的长视频。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing通过创新的联合去噪和注意力机制设计，有效解决了流式视频生成中的长期错误累积问题，为交互式世界模型和神经游戏引擎提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练视觉编码器与潜在扩散模型对齐的方法，作为图像生成的标记器，相比从头训练VAE能更好地保留语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE训练主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，希望利用这些语义信息来改进图像生成质量。

Method: 采用三阶段对齐策略：1)冻结编码器，训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2)联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3)精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，标记器加速扩散模型收敛，64个epoch内达到gFID 1.90；在LAION数据集上，20亿参数文本到图像模型性能优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式，能有效提升图像生成质量。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

TL;DR: PICO是一个基于扩散变换器的视觉上下文学习框架，通过单个标注示例推断底层变换并应用于新输入，无需重新训练，实现了开放式的个性化视觉任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但在用户自定义的个性化任务上表现不佳。现有个性化方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据管道，缺乏灵活性且局限于固定任务格式。

Method: 提出PICO框架，利用扩散变换器作为视觉上下文学习器，构建VisRel多样化调优数据集，并引入注意力引导的种子评分器来提高推理可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越了微调和合成数据基线方法，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非规模驱动鲁棒泛化，PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了一种无需重新训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

TL;DR: 提出LayerCD方法，通过对比视觉编码器中浅层和深层特征的输出分布来过滤多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成与输入图像上下文不一致的输出。研究发现浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低级信息，不足以支持高级推理

Method: LayerCD（层对比解码），通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤幻觉

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上进行了广泛实验，LayerCD显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: LayerCD是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，无需人工监督或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，但现有基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或未预料的幻觉漏洞。

Method: 在图像嵌入空间进行优化以误导模型，同时保持目标对象缺失，然后引导扩散模型基于该嵌入生成自然图像。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上，幻觉成功率超过28%，远高于之前数据驱动方法的约1%。为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o中诱导幻觉的成功率达66.5%。

Conclusion: GHOST既是诊断工具也是纠正工具，通过在其生成的图像上进行微调可以减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，在保持基础模型质量的同时显著提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在扩展到高分辨率（如4K图像生成）时面临显著的效率挑战。之前的研究很少处理潜在空间中的固有冗余问题。

Method: DC-Gen采用高效的后训练流程，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练来弥合基础模型潜在空间与深度压缩潜在空间之间的表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调即可解锁基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证了DC-Gen的有效性。DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上将4K图像生成的延迟降低了53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后，在单个NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，总延迟相比基础FLUX.1-Krea模型降低了138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够在保持生成质量的同时，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型，特别是在高分辨率图像生成场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen为视频生成提供了高效的后训练加速解决方案，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理包含显著物体变形、大尺度相机运动和有限视角覆盖的长视频序列，PAD3R旨在解决这些传统系统面临的挑战。

Method: 训练个性化的物体中心姿态估计器，通过预训练的图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并使用长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: PAD3R能够重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，在类别无关的方式下表现鲁棒，在挑战性场景中具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有潜力，通过结合生成先验和可微分渲染实现了对复杂变形物体的有效重建。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Conclusion: PixelCraft通过高保真图像处理和灵活的多智能体推理框架，有效解决了MLLMs在结构化图像上的推理挑战，展现出卓越的性能表现。

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法存在条件图像泄漏问题，导致运动缓慢、颜色不一致等性能下降，并且在域外场景中表现不佳。需要一种能够防止条件图像过度影响生成过程的方法。

Method: FlashI2V包含两个核心组件：1) 潜在偏移 - 通过从噪声潜在表示中减去条件图像信息来隐式整合条件；2) 傅里叶引导 - 使用傅里叶变换获得的高频幅度特征来加速收敛并调整生成视频的细节水平。

Result: 实验结果显示，FlashI2V有效克服了条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现了最佳泛化性能。仅使用1.3B参数就在Vbench-I2V上获得53.01的动态度分数，超越了CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P。

Conclusion: FlashI2V通过防止条件图像泄漏，显著提升了I2V生成的性能，特别是在域外场景中表现出优异的泛化能力，为图像到视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的后训练框架，通过将视觉输入分割、打乱并要求模型用自然语言重建正确排列顺序，来增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练范式主要基于文本，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。现有方法仍依赖文本作为中间媒介或引入额外的视觉生成组件，缺乏真正视觉中心的后训练方法。

Method: 提出Visual Jigsaw框架，将视觉输入分割成块、打乱顺序，模型需要生成正确的排列顺序作为自然语言输出。该方法与可验证奖励的强化学习对齐，无需额外视觉生成组件或人工标注。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上的广泛实验显示，该方法在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 自监督的视觉中心任务在后训练多模态大语言模型中具有巨大潜力，有望激发更多视觉中心预文本设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将3D基础模型应用于密集新视角合成，提出了VGGT-X方法来解决内存消耗大和输出不完美的问题，在密集COLMAP-free NVS中达到了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新视角合成方法依赖于SfM获取的准确3D属性，但SfM在低纹理或低重叠度场景中速度慢且脆弱。3D基础模型虽然速度快，但在密集视图设置中存在内存负担大和输出不完美的问题。

Method: 提出了VGGT-X方法，包括：内存高效的VGGT实现（可扩展到1000+图像）、自适应全局对齐用于增强VGGT输出、以及鲁棒的3DGS训练实践。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管道的质量差距，在密集COLMAP-free NVS和姿态估计中达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的应用提供了有效解决方案，并分析了与COLMAP初始化渲染的剩余差距，为未来发展提供了见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

Motivation: 解决蛋白质组学数据在临床解释中的两大挑战：缺乏指导调优数据集和专门的语言模型架构，以支持个性化癌症治疗。

Method: 构建了包含40万+样本的CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT指导调优数据集，并提出KRONOS图-LLM框架，利用分子相互作用拓扑学习患者特异性图表示。

Conclusion: 该方法使LLM能够理解患者水平的发病机制，通过更准确的诊断、预后和治疗分层推进精准医疗。

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease
phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision
medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive
individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical
heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data
modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular
understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge
due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable
clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language
modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular
data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning
dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k
open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from
the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose
KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via
Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular
interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph
representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves
competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular
classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from
proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand
patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate
diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 使用小规模对抗性探针分析人工神经网络脑模型的局部表示几何，发现大多数模型虽然预测准确度高但异常脆弱，对抗性敏感性比预测准确度能更好区分模型，局部编码方向不具跨架构可迁移性，鲁棒模型的对抗性探针产生可泛化且有语义意义的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着许多人工神经网络模型在预测神经响应方面达到相似的准确度，需要更强的评估标准来区分模型质量。

Method: 使用小规模对抗性探针来表征多个高预测准确度ANN脑模型的局部表示几何。

Result: 发现当代ANN脑模型异常脆弱，对抗性敏感性比预测准确度更能区分模型，局部编码方向不具跨架构可迁移性，鲁棒模型的探针产生可泛化且有语义意义的变化。

Conclusion: 局部表示几何为脑模型评估提供了更强标准，鲁棒模型因其更稳定的编码轴与神经选择性更好对齐而更受青睐。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for
modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting
neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive
accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial
probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly
predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show
that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite
high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to
small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding
directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial
probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than
prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct
local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures.
Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce
generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture
the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that
local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model
evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose
more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also
generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

TL;DR: TopoAudio模型通过在听觉模型中加入皮层布线约束损失，成功实现了人类听觉皮层的地形图组织，同时保持了与标准模型相当的预测性能和分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前听觉感知计算模型缺乏对人类听觉皮层地形图结构的考量，无法反映神经元按响应特性空间聚集的组织特征。

Method: 在基于耳蜗图输入的语音和环境声音分类任务中，添加了2D皮层片上邻近单元具有相似调谐特性的布线约束损失。

Result: TopoAudio模型在保持基准任务高准确率的同时，成功发展出平滑的拓扑映射，包括早期听觉表征的调频和调幅图，以及高阶皮层中音乐和语音的模块化响应区域。

Conclusion: 布线长度约束可作为通用正则化工具，帮助实现与生物学对齐的表征，TopoAudio是首个展现涌现地形图的端到端生物基础听觉模型。

Abstract: The human auditory cortex is topographically organized. Neurons with similar
response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic
features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions
selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for
current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such
topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that
cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at
predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of
topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally
designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models,
TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from
cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical
sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio
achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained
non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses
in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio
develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common
properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response
modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human
auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded
auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a
wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to
achieve biologically aligned representations.

TL;DR: VSSFlow是一个统一的流匹配框架，将视频到声音(V2S)和视觉文本到语音(VisualTTS)任务集成在一起，通过创新的条件聚合机制处理不同的输入信号，并在端到端联合学习中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频条件声音和语音生成任务通常作为独立任务处理，缺乏统一框架。现有统一尝试面临处理不同条件类型和复杂训练阶段的挑战。

Method: 使用流匹配框架，通过交叉注意力处理模糊视频条件，自注意力处理确定性语音转录本，采用条件聚合机制整合不同输入信号，支持端到端联合学习。

Result: VSSFlow在V2S和VisualTTS基准测试中均超越了最先进的领域特定基线方法，证明了统一生成模型的潜力。

Conclusion: VSSFlow成功统一了V2S和VisualTTS任务，通过共享的音频先验知识加速收敛、增强条件生成并稳定分类器自由引导过程，展示了统一生成模型的关键潜力。

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound
(V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed
as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle
framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in
handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript
conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks
remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which
seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching
framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle
distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer
exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition.
Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle
different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and
self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary
to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex
training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits
from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation
without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to
the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates
convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the
classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S
and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified
generative models.

Abstract: Whisper speech recognition is crucial not only for ensuring privacy in
sensitive communications but also for providing a critical communication bridge
for patients under vocal restraint and enabling discrete interaction in
noise-sensitive environments. The development of Chinese mandarin audio-visual
whisper speech recognition is hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets. We
present AISHELL6-Whisper, a large-scale open-source audio-visual whisper speech

with synchronized frontal facial videos. Moreover, we propose an audio-visual
speech recognition (AVSR) baseline based on the Whisper-Flamingo framework,
which integrates a parallel training strategy to align embeddings across speech
types, and employs a projection layer to adapt to whisper speech's spectral

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在存在部分调查数据的情况下，使用微调的大型语言模型来估算自我报告的投票选择，比较了零样本提示、监督微调与表格分类器在不同缺失数据模式下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查研究者面临两个关键挑战：概率样本成本上升和缺失数据（如无响应或流失），这会削弱推断能力并增加便利样本的使用。研究旨在探索在存在部分调查响应的情况下，使用LLMs进行数据填补的实用性。

Method: 使用德国纵向选举研究数据，在随机和系统性无响应情况下，对LLMs进行微调以填补自我报告的投票选择。比较了零样本提示、监督微调与表格分类器（如CatBoost），并测试了不同便利样本对泛化能力的影响。

Result: 当数据完全随机缺失时，微调的LLMs与表格分类器表现相当，但优于零样本方法。当只有有偏便利样本可用时，微调的小型开源LLMs在个体级预测和群体级分布恢复方面比零样本方法更准确，且通常优于表格方法。

Conclusion: 微调的LLMs为处理非概率样本或系统性缺失数据的研究者提供了有前景的策略，可能实现仅需易获取子群体的新调查设计。

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability
samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine
inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores
using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based
prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where
partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute
self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using
the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and
supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test
how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect
generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned
LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only
biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B)
open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and
population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better
than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy
for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness,
and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible
subpopulations.

Motivation: 由于端到端深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且本质上是关联性的，难以理解形态等额外信息如何贡献于星系物理属性估计。理解这一点有助于揭示星系属性间的物理联系并优化数据利用。

Method: 采用两种可解释性技术：因果分析（揭示变量间因果路径）和互信息分解（量化不同输入数据对恒星质量估计的冗余、独特和协同贡献）。使用SDSS和WISE数据进行分析。

Result: 获得了有意义的物理解释结果，为基于图像的模型提供了物理解释。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习与可解释性技术具有显著优势，有望推动更多数据驱动的天体物理研究（如天体物理参数估计和复杂多元物理过程研究）。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are
powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the
absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the
associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the
information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes
to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable
further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy
properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at
interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two
interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information
decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables
beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the
multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of
different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for
image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep
learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more
data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations
and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

Motivation: 方言语音蕴含丰富的文化和语言多样性，但由于数据稀缺、拼写不一致和复杂语音变化，构建方言TTS系统仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于F5-TTS架构，引入方言感知的混合专家模型来建模音系差异，并采用LoRA和条件适配器进行参数高效适配，实现快速迁移到新方言。

Result: 实验表明能够生成自然且富有表现力的语音，在未见过的方言和专门领域（如京剧）上实现零样本性能，仅需几小时数据。

Conclusion: DiaMoE-TTS实现了可扩展的、开放数据驱动的语音合成，不依赖大规模或专有资源。

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Motivation: 为了解决传统级联管道中语音合成与多模态理解分离的问题，实现高效的多模态交互和低延迟的流式语音生成。

Method: 采用双轨、基于token的架构，将多模态推理与实时语音生成解耦；使用统一训练策略和双音频编码器设计；采用基于分块的并行解码方案来缩小文本-语音token率差距。

Result: 在保持音色一致性、生成自然且上下文感知的语音、以及长时音频和多模态理解方面优于现有开源模型，且训练数据效率显著更高。

Conclusion: MGM-Omni建立了一个高效、端到端的范式，用于多模态理解和可控、个性化的长时程语音生成。

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,
end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised
long-horizon speech generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的音视频语音分离方法Dolphin，通过轻量级视觉编码器和音频分离器，在保持高质量分离的同时显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音视频语音分离方法通常参数量大、计算成本高，这在语音分离仅作为预处理步骤的应用中不可接受，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了DP-LipCoder双路径轻量级视频编码器将唇部运动转换为离散音频对齐语义token，构建了包含全局-局部注意力块的轻量级编码器-解码器分离器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，Dolphin不仅超越了当前SOTA模型的分离质量，还实现了显著效率提升：参数量减少50%以上，MACs降低2.4倍以上，GPU推理速度提升6倍以上。

Conclusion: Dolphin为现实场景中的高性能音视频语音分离提供了一个实用且可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract
target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic
environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of
parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many
applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for
further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS
method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a
dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete
audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight
encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local
attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also
achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more
than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These
results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for
high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are

*Tianle Wang,Sirui Zhang,Xinyi Tong,Peiyang Yu,Jishang Chen,Liangke Zhao,Xinpu Gao,Yves Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Bo Zheng,Duo Xu,Yang Liu,Xin Jin,Feng Yu,Songchun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督机器学习算法，从符号音乐数据中发现称为"音乐词"的重复模式，通过两阶段EM框架解决音乐语义模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐中的重复模式反映了作曲的认知过程，但由于音乐解释的语义模糊性，提取这些模式具有挑战性。

Method: 将音乐词发现建模为统计优化问题，采用两阶段EM学习框架：1.构建音乐词词典；2.重构音乐数据。

Result: 与人类专家标注相比，算法获得了0.61的IoU分数，表明最小化编码长度能有效解决语义模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法使计算机能够从音乐数据中提取"基本构建块"，支持AI音乐任务和音乐学分析，揭示了人类编码系统优化对音乐语义的影响。

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that
identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from
symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and
reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting
these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity
in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a
statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage
Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a
music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against
human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union
(IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length
effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of
encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to
extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural
analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First,
in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation,
classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it
provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into
the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

### [562] [Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread "VIA" Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23041)
*Zi Liang,Qingqing Ye,Xuan Liu,Yanyun Wang,Jianliang Xu,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了合成数据集成训练对LLMs的安全性影响，发现该范式对现有投毒和后门攻击具有强抵抗力。作者提出了一种新的病毒感染攻击框架VIA，能够通过合成数据传播恶意内容，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽能提升LLM性能，但其引入的安全风险尚未被充分研究。本文旨在系统评估合成数据训练范式对主流投毒和后门攻击的抵抗力，并探索潜在安全威胁。

Method: 提出病毒感染攻击框架VIA，借鉴网络安全中的病毒设计原理，将投毒载荷隐藏在保护壳中，在良性样本中寻找最优劫持点以最大化恶意内容生成概率。

Result: 实验表明，VIA显著增加了合成数据中的投毒内容比例，将下游模型的攻击成功率提升到与上游被投毒模型相当的水平。

Conclusion: 合成数据训练范式虽然对现有攻击有抵抗力，但通过精心设计的VIA攻击框架仍可被成功攻破，揭示了合成数据引入的新安全风险。

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has
been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language
models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development,
potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper
systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training
paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal
that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily
thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and
queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of
these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by
synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely,
Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks
through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the
principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload
within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking
points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious
content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show
that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic
data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream
models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaskSQL是一个文本到SQL框架，使用抽象作为隐私保护机制来掩盖LLM提示中的敏感信息，在保持隐私的同时实现接近最先进LLM模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在敏感系统中集成LLM时的隐私问题，因为现有LLM需要共享数据给第三方提供商，存在隐私风险且不符合监管要求。

Method: 引入抽象作为隐私保护机制，通过保留必要信息同时丢弃不必要细节，在文本到SQL任务中实现隐私与效用的平衡。

Result: MaskSQL在性能上超越了领先的基于SLM的文本到SQL模型，并接近最先进的基于LLM的模型，同时保持了隐私保护。

Conclusion: MaskSQL通过抽象机制有效平衡了隐私与性能，为敏感环境中的文本到SQL任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that
require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging.
However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their
integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary,
costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical.
Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party
providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations.
Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain
tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform
on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we
introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a
privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts.
Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which
broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding
unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the
text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the
privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range
of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading
SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching
state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

*Yixu Wang,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对LoRA适配模型的新型模型提取攻击方法StolenLoRA，该方法使用合成数据和半监督学习策略，仅需1万次查询即可达到96.60%的攻击成功率，揭示了LoRA适配模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA等参数高效微调方法虽然实现了视觉模型的快速定制部署，但其紧凑性带来了新的安全隐患，特别是对模型提取攻击的脆弱性。本文旨在研究针对LoRA适配模型的提取攻击。

Method: 提出StolenLoRA攻击方法：1）利用大语言模型生成有效提示用于数据生成；2）采用基于分歧的半监督学习策略从有限查询中最大化信息增益；3）训练替代模型来提取LoRA适配模型的功能。

Result: 实验显示StolenLoRA非常有效，仅用1万次查询就达到96.60%的攻击成功率，即使在攻击者和受害者模型使用不同预训练骨干网络的跨骨干场景下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LoRA适配模型对提取攻击的特定脆弱性，迫切需要针对PEFT方法的鲁棒防御机制。初步探索了基于多样化LoRA部署的防御策略，显示了其缓解此类攻击的潜力。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have transformed
vision model adaptation, enabling the rapid deployment of customized models.
However, the compactness of LoRA adaptations introduces new safety concerns,
particularly their vulnerability to model extraction attacks. This paper
introduces a new focus of model extraction attacks named LoRA extraction that
extracts LoRA-adaptive models based on a public pre-trained model. We then
propose a novel extraction method called StolenLoRA which trains a substitute
model to extract the functionality of a LoRA-adapted model using synthetic
data. StolenLoRA leverages a Large Language Model to craft effective prompts
for data generation, and it incorporates a Disagreement-based Semi-supervised
Learning (DSL) strategy to maximize information gain from limited queries. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of StolenLoRA, achieving up to a
96.60% attack success rate with only 10k queries, even in cross-backbone
scenarios where the attacker and victim models utilize different pre-trained
backbones. These findings reveal the specific vulnerability of LoRA-adapted
models to this type of extraction and underscore the urgent need for robust
defense mechanisms tailored to PEFT methods. We also explore a preliminary
defense strategy based on diversified LoRA deployments, highlighting its
potential to mitigate such attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的蒸馏条件后门攻击（DCBA），通过在教师模型中植入休眠后门，在知识蒸馏过程中激活学生模型中的后门，即使使用干净的蒸馏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现知识蒸馏过程中存在被忽视的安全漏洞，第三方平台提供的教师模型即使经过安全验证，仍可能包含在蒸馏过程中激活的隐蔽后门。

Method: 将攻击建模为双层优化问题，提出SCAR方法：内层优化通过优化代理学生模型模拟蒸馏过程，外层优化利用代理输出来优化教师模型植入条件后门，使用隐式微分算法和预优化的触发器注入函数。

Result: 在多个数据集、模型架构和知识蒸馏技术上的广泛实验验证了SCAR的有效性，且能抵抗现有的后门检测方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了知识蒸馏过程中一个重大但被忽视的漏洞，强调了在部署前需要更严格的安全验证。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from
large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from
third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor
detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional
backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into
teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process,
even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing
methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as
a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method
(\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by
optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages
outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the
conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an
implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection
function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures,
and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance
against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously
overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现代AI生成器产生的大规模图像需要能够嵌入高载荷水印的方法，以嵌入图像的语义描述信息，便于后续的图像-文本不匹配分析。

Method: 基于传统水印方案，利用正交和turbo码提高鲁棒性，集成频域嵌入和感知掩蔽技术增强水印不可感知性。

Result: 实验表明该方法对各种图像处理操作具有极强鲁棒性，即使在传统和AI修复后仍能检索嵌入文本，可通过图像-文本不匹配分析揭示图像的语义修改。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在大规模AI生成图像中高载荷文本水印的鲁棒嵌入和提取，为图像语义完整性验证提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding,
where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the
input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to
robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by
modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional
watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved
robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking
techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the
proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing,
and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI
inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has
undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

<details>

Method: 建立UV贴图上纹素与输入图像像素的对应关系，每个纹素颜色计算为关联像素值的加权混合。使用可微分渲染优化混合参数，确保光度一致性和透视一致性，同时保持无缝纹理连贯性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从无序照片集合中自动生成逼真的建筑纹理贴图，有效补偿几何简化带来的细节损失。

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural
structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering.
However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of
fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to
compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the
original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task,
particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an
automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy
models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered
photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV
map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a
weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we
optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency,
while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural
models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of
high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统复合透镜设计方法仅能优化连续参数（如曲率），需要专家干预来改变拓扑结构，无法自动优化离散参数（如透镜数量和类型）。

Method: 结合梯度优化和定制的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样算法，使用跨维度变异和近轴投影操作进行高效全局探索。

Result: 在多种透镜设计任务中，该方法有效探索了扩展的设计空间，产生了比先前方法更好的设计，推进了自动化透镜设计的性能边界。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动联合优化连续和离散参数，显著提升了复合透镜设计的自动化水平和性能表现。

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous
and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance
in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens
design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g.,
curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring
extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our
method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type
(e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this
capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and
paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show
experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively
explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs
than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs
achievable by automated lens design.

Motivation: 当前单图像场景重建方法在复杂环境中难以同时保证单个资产质量和整体场景连贯性，纹理编辑技术也难以维持局部连续性和多视角一致性。

Method: 利用大视觉模型的先验知识，提取对象级2D分割和深度信息推断空间关系，通过联合优化3D和2D投影损失来更新对象姿态，采用掩码引导的渐进图像生成策略和PBR材质估计。

Conclusion: ZeroScene成功实现了零样本的单图像到3D场景重建和纹理编辑，在保持场景连贯性和多视角一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction
methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual
assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while
texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and
multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene,
which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both
single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot
manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information
from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then
jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update
object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent
and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background.
Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By
imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided
progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture
consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of
rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the
geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully
reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely
align with text prompts.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete
point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited
sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region
partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly
uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a
shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal
reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural
discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called
Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns
node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and
curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a
geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge
aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance
representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have
demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However,
the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point
cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale
application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking
control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling
the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part
existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency
relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby
constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph
representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point
cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract
structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of
the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer
module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate
structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that
our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces
high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of
controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and
achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation
on the ShapeNet dataset.

Conclusion: 提出的Diff-3DCap方法在3D形状描述任务中表现出色，验证了扩散模型在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the
domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent
years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the
utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet
often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,
in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected
views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate
the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous
diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by
introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation
during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a
commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained
visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a
guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive
results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance
comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ReLumix是一个新颖的视频重光照框架，将重光照算法与时序合成解耦，使任何图像重光照技术都能无缝应用于视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频后期制作中的光照控制是计算摄影中的重要但难以实现的目标，现有方法缺乏灵活性，限制了用户只能使用特定的重光照模型。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：艺术家使用任意图像重光照技术处理单个参考帧，然后通过微调的稳定视频扩散模型将目标光照传播到整个序列。使用门控交叉注意力机制和平滑特征融合确保时序一致性。

Result: 尽管在合成数据上训练，ReLumix在真实世界视频上表现出良好的泛化能力，在视觉保真度方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: ReLumix为动态光照控制提供了一个可扩展且多功能的解决方案，解决了视频重光照的灵活性问题。

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如HPR在计算效率、噪声鲁棒性和处理凹区域或低密度点云方面存在局限性，需要更先进的可见性判定方法

Method: 使用3D U-Net提取视图无关的点特征，结合共享MLP和视图方向输入来预测点可见性，端到端训练

Result: 在准确性和计算效率上显著优于HPR，大型点云上达到126倍加速，对噪声和不同点云密度具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法在多个数据集上验证有效，可广泛应用于点云可视化、表面重建、法线估计等任务

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the
visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due
to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods,
such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational
efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility
determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification
task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts
view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction
as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility
labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms
HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times
speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates
robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to
unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing
substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud
visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and
viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at

TL;DR: Light-SQ是一个基于超二次曲面的优化框架，通过结构感知的方法实现高效、高保真且可编辑的3D形状抽象，适用于用户生成内容(UGC)场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户生成内容应用中，非专业用户依赖图像到3D生成模型创建3D资产。基于基元的形状抽象通过将高分辨率网格压缩为紧凑、可编辑的表示，为UGC场景提供有前景的解决方案。

Method: 1) SDF雕刻迭代更新目标符号距离场，减少基元间重叠；2) 结构感知体积分解指导的块-重生长-填充策略，驱动基元放置；3) 基于SDF更新历史的自适应残差剪枝，抑制过分割并确保紧凑结果；4) 支持多尺度拟合以保留精细几何细节。

Result: 提出了3DGen-Prim基准测试，扩展了3DGen-Bench并增加了重建质量和基元级可编辑性的新指标。实验证明Light-SQ能够为复杂生成几何实现高效、高保真且可编辑的形状抽象。

Conclusion: Light-SQ通过结构感知的超二次曲面抽象，推进了3D UGC创建的可行性，为复杂几何提供了高效、高保真且可编辑的形状表示。

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on
image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,
primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios
by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.
Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be
structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware
alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel
superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes
structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to
iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap
between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by
structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to
drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on
SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In
addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement
to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce
3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both
reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape
abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the
feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

Conclusion: CharGen在角色图像编辑中成功平衡了控制精度、生成速度和视觉质量，为交互式编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains
challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control,
generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a
character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders,
trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size,
expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more
interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often
accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that
reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency.
Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source
InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督可微分框架，用于自动生成语义和可见性感知的UV映射，解决了传统手动UV映射的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型依赖手动UV映射，这是一个耗时且需要专业技能的过程，成为3D内容创作的主要瓶颈。现有自动方法缺乏语义对齐和可见性感知能力。

Method: 使用无监督学习框架，结合语义分割和逐部分UV参数化，通过环境遮挡加权接缝目标引导接缝位于遮挡区域。

Result: 相比现有方法，该方法生成的UV图集能更好地支持纹理生成，并减少可见接缝伪影。

Conclusion: 该框架成功自动化了UV映射过程，在语义对齐和可见性感知方面优于现有方法，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh
objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D
meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual
task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry
surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset
creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,
existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:
(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts
across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in
regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate
the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable
framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-
and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)
segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned
per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts
into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion
(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted
seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting
qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we
show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture
generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在图层表示中创建和编辑图形设计，但一旦合成到栅格图像中，基于图层的编辑就变得不可能。需要一种方法将栅格图形设计分解回图层，以支持可重新编辑的创意工作流程。

Method: LayerD通过迭代提取未被遮挡的前景层来解决分解任务，利用图形设计中图层通常具有均匀外观的假设，提出了一种简单而有效的细化方法。

Result: 实验表明，LayerD成功实现了高质量的分解，并优于基线方法。该方法还可与最先进的图像生成器和基于图层的编辑工具结合使用。

Conclusion: LayerD提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够将栅格图形设计分解为可重新编辑的图层，解决了图形设计工作流程中的关键限制。

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but
layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In
this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into
layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition
task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a
simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption
that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As
decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be
reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In
experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality
decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD
with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

<details>

Motivation: 纯GTO策略只能避免损失但不能保证最大利润，需要开发能够超越GTO并剥削对手的模型

Method: 首先通过自我对弈模拟找到接近理论最佳策略的GTO基础，然后观察对手行为并实时调整策略进行剥削

Result: 蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化(CFR)在单挑情况下表现最佳，CFR在多数多玩家情况下仍是最强方法

Conclusion: 结合GTO的防御优势和实时剥削能力，扑克智能体可以从避免损失转向持续战胜多样化对手

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL基准不适合SQL到SQL评估，主要关注有限数据库系统（通常只有SQLite），无法捕捉许多系统特定的SQL方言（如自定义函数、数据类型和语法规则）。

Method: 从38个开源基准和真实业务服务中收集598个翻译对，提供多个基准变体：PARROT-Diverse（28,003个翻译用于广泛语法测试）和PARROT-Simple（5,306个代表性样本用于重点压力测试）。

Result: LLM在PARROT基准上的平均准确率低于38.53%，表明当前模型在跨系统SQL翻译方面仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: PARROT填补了跨系统SQL翻译评估的空白，为未来研究提供了实用的基准测试平台，并发布了公开排行榜和源代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22

Motivation: SNNs因其能效高和内存占用小而受到关注，但在视觉任务中的对抗鲁棒性研究仍不成熟。现有研究使用稀疏梯度作为正则化来增强鲁棒性，但本文发现SNNs在特定配置下自然具有梯度稀疏性。

Method: 研究发现SNNs在特定架构配置下自然表现出梯度稀疏性，无需任何显式正则化即可实现对抗防御。

Result: SNNs在特定配置下能够达到最先进的对抗防御性能，但分析揭示了鲁棒性与泛化性之间的权衡：稀疏梯度提高鲁棒性但损害泛化能力，密集梯度支持更好泛化但增加攻击脆弱性。

Conclusion: SNNs的梯度稀疏性特性为对抗防御提供了自然优势，但需要在鲁棒性和泛化性之间进行平衡设计。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their
inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving
adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains
a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging
sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against
adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under
specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity
and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the
need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off
between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to
improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to
generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but
increase vulnerability to attacks.

Conclusion: 这是首次在混合ANN-SNN中实现位平面编码的替代梯度方法，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in
energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has
consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However,
existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN
and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due
to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions,
causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during
backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN
framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within
conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate
gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end
differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves
competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while
retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of
spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and
spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid
ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new
directions for future research.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) has been established as a high-accuracy
3D reconstruction method capable of achieving sub-pixel accuracy. However, this
technique faces significant constraints due to complex calibration
requirements, bulky system footprint, and sensitivity to environmental
conditions. To address these limitations, we present VIRTUS-FPP, the first
comprehensive physics-based virtual sensor modeling framework for FPP built in
NVIDIA Isaac Sim. By leveraging the physics-based rendering and programmable
sensing capabilities of simulation, our framework enables end-to-end modeling
from calibration to reconstruction with full mathematical fidelity to the
underlying principles of structured light. We conduct comprehensive virtual
calibration and validate our system's reconstruction accuracy through
quantitative comparison against ground truth geometry. Additionally, we
demonstrate the ability to model the virtual system as a digital twin by
replicating a physical FPP system in simulation and validating correspondence
between virtual and real-world measurements. Experimental results demonstrate
that VIRTUS-FPP accurately models optical phenomena critical to FPP and
achieves results comparable to real-world systems while offering unprecedented
flexibility for system configuration, sensor prototyping, and environmental
control. This framework significantly accelerates the development of real-world
FPP systems by enabling rapid virtual prototyping before physical

protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias
mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the
degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single
attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre
hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of
being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing
drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin
tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an
adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone
normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically
to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework,
two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner
optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft
nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of
each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments
conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in
simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive
attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the
pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually
training is done off line. More importantly,

TL;DR: 提出PnP-CM方法，将一致性模型重新解释为先验的邻近算子，集成到plug-and-play框架中，实现快速收敛的逆问题求解，仅需2-4步即可获得高质量重建结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于一致性模型的逆问题求解器要么需要额外任务特定训练，要么使用收敛缓慢的数据保真度操作，不适用于大规模问题。

Method: 将一致性模型重新解释为先验的邻近算子，集成到PnP-ADMM框架中，利用共轭梯度法实现快速收敛，并通过噪声注入和动量进一步加速。

Result: 在多种逆问题（修复、超分辨率、高斯去模糊、MRI重建）上验证，PnP-CM仅需4步即可获得高质量重建，2步即可产生有意义结果，优于同类CM方法。

Conclusion: PnP-CM是首个针对MRI数据集训练的一致性模型，在现实世界逆问题中表现出色，实现了高效快速的重建。

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse
problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the
posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of
the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related
to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed
to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE
trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also
been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either
require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations
with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we
reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration
into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM,
which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method.
We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM,
and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We
evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting,
super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for
MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality
reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2
steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while
outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了S$^3$F-Net双分支框架，同时学习空间和频谱表示，通过融合深度空间CNN和浅层频谱编码器SpectraNet，在四个医学影像数据集上显著优于仅空间基线，准确率提升最高达5.13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络仅关注单一空间域，无法有效捕捉全局模式和频率域特征，限制了医学图像分析的效果。

Method: 采用双分支框架：深度空间CNN分支和浅层频谱编码器SpectraNet分支。SpectraNet包含SpectralFilter层，利用卷积定理在傅里叶频谱上应用可学习滤波器，实现全局感受野。

Result: 在四个医学影像数据集上均显著优于仅空间基线，BRISC2025数据集准确率达98.76%，胸部X光肺炎数据集准确率达93.11%。可解释性分析显示网络能根据输入病理动态调整对各分支的依赖。

Conclusion: 双域方法是医学图像分析中强大且可泛化的范式，能有效结合空间和频谱信息提升性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image
analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features.
However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global,
holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain
characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral
Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns
from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net
performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral
encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer,
which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters
directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient
element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a
global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a
lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical
imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and
generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its
strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to
5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive
accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs
better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11%
accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our
explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically
adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results
verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm
for medical image analysis.

Method: 使用Zauron Labs的高性能图像模型(AUC=0.938)和基于Meta Llama 3.2微调的语言模型，对3988名患者的5000次检查进行回顾性分析

Result: 发现495名患者(12.4%)存在编码错误，84名患者(2.1%)存在漏诊，潜在挽回31.4万美元年收入

Conclusion: UTMB决定在全系统采用Zauron的Guardian Pro软件，通过AI增强的同行评审和编码，改善患者护理和财务稳定性

Abstract: This case study details The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)'s
partnership with Zauron Labs, Inc. to enhance detection and coding of aortic
calcifications (ACs) using chest radiographs. ACs are often underreported
despite their significant prognostic value for cardiovascular disease, and UTMB
partnered with Zauron to apply its advanced AI tools, including a
high-performing image model (AUC = 0.938) and a fine-tuned language model based
on Meta's Llama 3.2, to retrospectively analyze imaging and report data. The
effort identified 495 patients out of 3,988 unique patients assessed (5,000
total exams) whose reports contained indications of aortic calcifications that
were not properly coded for reimbursement (12.4% miscode rate) as well as an
additional 84 patients who had aortic calcifications that were missed during
initial review (2.1% misdiagnosis rate). Identification of these patients
provided UTMB with the potential to impact clinical care for these patients and
pursue $314k in missed annual revenue. These findings informed UTMB's decision
to adopt Zauron's Guardian Pro software system-wide to ensure accurate,
AI-enhanced peer review and coding, improving both patient care and financial
solvency. This study is covered under University of Texas Health San Antonio's

Motivation: 多参数MRI在前列腺癌诊断中存在假阳性、假阴性和观察者间一致性中等的问题，需要更准确、更少依赖读者训练的诊断工具。

Conclusion: AI增强的时间依赖性扩散MRI技术有望改善前列腺癌的诊断准确性，减少对读者经验的依赖，为临床提供更可靠的诊断工具。

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and
the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk,
improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing
unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by
false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver
agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables
tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical
performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa.
Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust,
zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and
improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol
out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a
home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic
care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results
against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

TL;DR: ReCon-GS是一个用于在线自由视点视频重建的存储感知框架，通过动态分配多级锚点高斯模型来分解场景运动，实现高效训练和实时渲染，同时显著降低内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线自由视点视频重建中存在的三个主要挑战：逐帧优化速度慢、运动估计不一致以及存储需求不可持续。

Method: 1. 动态分配多级锚点高斯模型，以密度自适应方式捕捉帧间几何变形；2. 设计动态层次重构策略，通过按需锚点重新分层保持局部运动表达能力；3. 引入存储感知优化机制，灵活调整不同层次锚点高斯的密度。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上的实验表明：训练效率提升约15%，FVV合成质量优于现有方法，具有更强的鲁棒性和稳定性；在同等渲染质量下，内存需求比领先方法降低超过50%。

Conclusion: ReCon-GS框架成功解决了在线自由视点视频重建的关键挑战，在保持高质量重建的同时显著提升了效率和存储性能，为实时动态场景重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow
per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable
storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable
Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework
that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time
rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians
in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations,
thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations.
Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves
localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization,
while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation
inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy
levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that
flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels,
enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory
usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that,
compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by
approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced
robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS
slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR)框架，用于卫星海表温度数据的超分辨率重建，结合小波变换和状态空间模型来提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海表温度是重要的气候变化指标，但获取高分辨率数据存在挑战。Mamba模型在长距离依赖建模方面表现出色，但在SST数据超分辨率应用尚未充分探索。

Method: WMSR包含两个关键组件：低频状态空间模块(LFSSM)使用2D-SSM捕捉全局信息，高频增强模块(HFEM)使用像素差异卷积来匹配和校正高频特征。

Result: 在三个SST数据集上的综合实验表明，WMSR在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: WMSR框架成功地将Mamba模型应用于SST数据超分辨率任务，展示了在保持关键温度信息和实现清晰纹理方面的优越性能。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate
change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions.
Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in
physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising
solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM)
have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with
linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution
remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba
Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR
includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and
High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture
global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling
capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature
information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel
difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature,
achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on
three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/oucailab/WMSR.

Motivation: 早期检测糖尿病视网膜病变至关重要，可以及时干预，预防视力丧失并有效管理糖尿病并发症。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）预处理：模糊滤波去噪、非线性扩散滤波去除伪影、自适应可变距离斑点滤波增强对比度；2）分割：改进的Mask RCNN；3）特征提取和分类：自空间注意力VGG-16。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过有效的预处理、分割和分类策略，提高了DR和DME检测和分级的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is crucial as it allows for
timely intervention, preventing vision loss and enabling effective management
of diabetic complications. This research performs detection of DR and DME at an
early stage through the proposed framework which includes three stages:
preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In the
preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact
removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast
improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance
Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation
methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter
adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value
amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to
achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error
value with high PSNR. The segmentation stage is performed using Improved
Mask-Regional Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask RCNN). In the final stage,
feature extraction and classification using novel Self-Spatial Attention
infused VGG-16 (SSA-VGG-16), which effectively captures both global contextual
relationships and critical spatial regions within retinal images, thereby
improving the accuracy and robustness of DR and DME detection and grading. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using two distinct datasets:
IDRiD and MESSIDOR.

Motivation: 传统自动多智能体系统采用"一次性生成部署"范式，导致系统脆弱且无法适应现实环境的动态性和不确定性，需要更灵活的自适应系统。

Method: 设计了"生成器-实施者-修正者"三智能体团队，能够根据实时任务需求动态组合和自适应修正目标智能体系统，并使用协作树优化来训练这些元智能体。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，MAS²在深度研究和代码生成等复杂场景中比最先进的多智能体系统性能提升高达19.6%，且具有优异的跨骨干网络泛化能力，使用未见过的LLM也能获得15.1%的改进。

Conclusion: MAS²在不产生过高令牌成本的情况下实现了显著的性能提升，始终位于成本-性能权衡的帕累托前沿，为多智能体系统的自进化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

Motivation: 解决情感研究中行为-神经鸿沟问题，即人类自我报告难以预测大脑活动，探索大规模相似性判断是否能更准确地捕捉大脑的情感几何结构。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型和仅语言模型作为认知代理，对2,180个情感激发视频进行数百万次三元组异常判断，生成30维情感嵌入表示。

Result: MLLM的情感表示在预测人类情感处理网络神经活动方面准确率最高，不仅优于LLM，也出乎意料地优于直接来自人类行为评分的表示。

Conclusion: 感官基础（从丰富视觉数据学习）对于发展真正神经对齐的情感概念框架至关重要，MLLM能自主开发丰富、神经对齐的情感表示，为连接主观体验与神经基础提供了有力范式。

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

Result: 环境对话性和救赎弧等特征预测可靠性高（R²≈0.64-0.68），而记忆印记等特征仍具挑战性，揭示了纯视觉编码的局限性。可视化创造力特征空间支持可解释的、特征感知的协同创作。

Conclusion: 通过将文化美学洞察与计算建模相结合，该研究为艺术家、研究人员和AI系统提供了共享语言和可解释工具，促进了有意义的协作，同时认识到纯视觉编码在捕捉某些创造力维度方面的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for
modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and
Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from
psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and
ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we
annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and
evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits
such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high
reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint
remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond
technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how
it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a
Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking
cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to
reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable
tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

Conclusion: 全面理解过去对于准确预测用户未来路径至关重要，MHL框架有效提升了生成式推荐的性能

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

Conclusion: Retro*通过细粒度推理和可扩展的评分机制，有效解决了推理密集型文档检索的挑战，为LLM代理和RAG系统提供了更可靠的文档检索能力。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

*Siwei Wang,Yifei Shen,Haoran Sun,Shi Feng,Shang-Hua Teng,Li Dong,Yaru Hao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象模型分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现RL通过探索避免SFT的伪相关解，但PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持多样性且具有离策略学习优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在LLM规划中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用可处理的图抽象模型，重点分析策略梯度(PG)和Q学习方法，并在真实规划基准Blocksworld上进行验证。

Result: SFT会引入基于共现的伪相关解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；PG存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持多样性且具有离策略学习优势；需要精心设计奖励函数防止奖励黑客攻击。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制提升LLM规划泛化能力，但不同RL算法存在显著差异，Q学习在多样性和离策略学习方面优于PG，奖励设计对防止奖励黑客至关重要。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架来评估LLM机制发现的可推广性，定义了五个对应轴，并通过分析Pythia模型中的1-back注意力头验证了发展轨迹的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来判断发现何时能推广到其他模型，需要解决机制发现的可推广性这一基本认识论挑战。

Method: 提出了五个机制对应轴（功能、发展、位置、关系、配置），并实证分析Pythia模型不同规模（14M-410M）和随机种子中1-back注意力头的发展轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力头在发展轨迹上具有惊人一致性，但位置一致性有限；更大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早出现、更陡峭增长和更高峰值。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性映射到其涌现行为和机制上。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，用几何交互取代全局排名，揭示模型的专业化能力和泛化特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估方法将多样化能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维特性，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 使用几何项目反应理论框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型与问题的几何交互决定。

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，大范数对应更难问题，支持新LLM的单嵌入拟合，揭示与人类定义类别部分对齐的LLM内部分类法。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，通过蒸馏问题解决策略来动态提升弱模型性能，减少对强模型的调用并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法在遇到相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵的强模型，导致成本增加。需要一种能够在线学习并减少对强模型依赖的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，将其解决方案蒸馏为可重用的通用问题解决策略，这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态改进性能，无需耗时耗力的微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统性能（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少对强模型的调用（相对减少48.05%）和相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识转移，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Agentless训练方法可以培养技能先验，这些技能可以迁移到SWE-Agent框架中，实现工作流和代理框架的融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SWE领域的解决方案分为多轮交互的SWE-Agent框架和单轮可验证步骤的工作流方法，作者认为这两种范式并不互斥，而是可以相互补充。

Method: 首先制定了Agentless训练方案，开发了Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行SFT适配，使其能够支持SWE-Agent。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中最好的；经过适配后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: 来自Agentless训练的结构化技能先验可以桥接工作流和代理框架，创建可迁移的编码代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出MNPO框架，将Nash学习从人类反馈从双玩家扩展到多玩家设置，解决了现有方法在捕捉复杂偏好结构时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法（如RLHF）和双玩家Nash学习（如INPO、ONPO、EGPO）难以捕捉现实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性，存在单一对手偏差。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n玩家Nash博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质标注条件和混合策略评估场景下实现更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无超参数的p-less采样方法，基于信息论动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响，需要一种更鲁棒的采样策略。

Method: 基于信息论方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需手动设置超参数。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中表现优于现有方法，在高温条件下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效且高效的解码策略，在保持质量的同时提高了推理效率，无需超参数调优。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段框架，通过识别计算器模式和算法模式两种工具使用模式，并优化模式选择来提升工具集成推理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽视了如何应用工具的问题。研究发现工具使用模式选择不当会导致推理失败。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从两种模式（计算器模式和算法模式）构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐。

Result: 在多个数学数据集上显著提升了代码使用率和准确率，如MATH500上的Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，AIME24从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知的方法能有效提升工具集成推理的性能。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: JET方法训练大型推理模型主动终止不必要的推理步骤，通过轨迹截断和质量控制长度奖励，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高，现有强化学习方法难以在rollout阶段构建短推理路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: 提出JET方法：1) 在rollout阶段进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径；2) 使用质量控制长度奖励，在鼓励简洁推理的同时保持正确性。

Result: JET显著提升推理效率而不牺牲准确性。DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准测试中准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET通过主动终止冗余推理步骤，有效解决了大型推理模型的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力限制等问题，需要一种更机制化的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和LLM能力的内在联系。

Method: 通过大规模元评估，使用逐步前向选择和线性回归在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，分析签名与基准问题语义相似性和模型性能相关性之间的关系。

Result: 发现知识和推理子任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似性较低，编码是最不重叠的领域。性能级结果受基准无关因素（如问题格式）影响，而基准签名对这些影响保持稳健。

Conclusion: 基准签名为基准测试有效性和LLM敏感性提供了机制性洞察，描绘了相互关联的LLM能力底层图景，有助于更准确地评估模型能力。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

TL;DR: ChemMAS是一个基于多智能体系统的化学反应条件推荐框架，将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，通过分解为多个子任务并提供可解释的决策依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法很少解释推荐反应条件背后的原理，限制了其在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性，需要开发能够提供可解释推理的AI系统。

Method: 将任务分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和原理聚合四个步骤，每个决策都有基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释依据。

Result: 实验显示ChemMAS在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提高20-35%，比通用大语言模型高出10-15%，同时提供可证伪、可信赖的推理依据。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多智能体系统实现基于证据的推理和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

TL;DR: CANON是一种新的优势估计方法，通过基于目标指标（如熵或响应长度）对采样响应进行分组比较，在不预设指标方向的情况下增强其影响，从而提升LLM在推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通过奖励或优势塑造引入先验知识，但需要手动调整超参数且方向性先验可能过于偏颇导致失败。需要一种不预设指标方向的方法来有效利用训练指标。

Method: CANON方法：1）根据目标指标值高低将采样响应分为两组；2）通过组间比较衡量哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能；3）在同一组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于先前方法。应用于响应长度时，CANON进一步提高了token效率，在性能-成本权衡中获得了更优的Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: CANON提供了一种有效的方法来放大目标指标的影响而不预设其方向，在推理任务中实现了持续的性能提升和更好的效率权衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，研究发现至少需要2次重复运行才能显著提高排名稳定性，建议在随机解码下使用≥2次重复评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不清楚，因此重新评估了8个最先进模型在AI4Math基准上的表现。

Method: 使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估，通过三次独立运行评估额外重复的价值。

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转；平均运行仅带来约5%的标准误缩减。

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复，这些实践能提高鲁棒性，同时对小团队可行，有助于使模型比较与现实世界可靠性保持一致。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型存在推理过程与最终答案不一致的问题，研究发现这是由于链式推理和记忆检索两种机制同时作用导致的。作者提出FARL框架，通过记忆遗忘与强化学习结合来抑制检索捷径，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解决复杂问题时表现出色，但研究发现其最终答案经常与自身的推理轨迹相矛盾。作者假设这种不一致性源于两种竞争机制：链式推理和记忆检索。

Method: 通过受控实验挑战模型在推理过程中的误导线索和检索过程中的损坏答案，验证两种机制的同时作用。提出FARL框架，整合记忆遗忘与强化学习来抑制检索捷径。

Result: 实验结果证实两种机制确实同时运作，其相对主导地位受问题领域、模型规模和微调方法等因素影响。当前推理微调范式存在关键限制，模型可能利用检索机制作为捷径。

Conclusion: FARL框架通过抑制检索捷径，促进了推理主导行为，增强了可泛化的推理能力，为解决当前推理微调范式中的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入应用统一推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题推理不足，需要更智能的计算分配策略。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来暂停或执行推理步骤，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization作为奖励信号自适应调节推理深度。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-准确率边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配的准确性，优于早期退出基线方法。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder成功实现了与问题难度相关的校准计算分配，展示了可解释的引导方向，为LLM推理提供了高效的自适应计算框架。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: SpecExit是一种新颖的框架，通过轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号，解决了大型推理模型过度思考的问题，显著减少了生成长度和端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型经常存在过度思考问题，产生不必要的长输出并导致高延迟，这限制了其实际部署。现有的提前退出机制虽然能缩短生成长度，但依赖探测机制引入了检测开销，限制了延迟收益和跨问题的泛化能力。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态使用的启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。该方法利用隐藏状态的固有信号提供有效的提前退出信号。

Result: 与推测解码基线相比，该方法将平均生成长度减少了66%，端到端延迟实现了2.5倍加速，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用隐藏状态进行高效推理的广泛适用性，为大型推理模型的实时部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a

effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒和可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，通过教导模型动态自我修正来解决思维链推理中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这种不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对齐推理过程的安全性。

Method: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过将合规步骤替换为安全触发器，构建强信号偏好学习对来强制安全推理。

Result: 在越狱和对抗安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升了推理和回答的整体安全性，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务中保持优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Conclusion: EvoPH推进了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域，有效解决了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: 当前大模型在遇到困难问题时会产生大量无效推理，浪费计算资源且给出错误答案，这反映了现有回答范式忽视了问题与模型能力边界的关系。

Method: 通过分析推理置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现模型能识别自身能力边界。基于此提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种边界感知策略。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型具有识别自身能力边界的自我意识，边界感知策略能有效提升模型推理的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SQuID方法利用大语言模型嵌入有效恢复心理测量问卷的潜在维度结构，无需领域特定微调即可获得维度间负相关，解释55%的人类数据方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索语义嵌入能否有效复制人类调查建立的心理测量结构。

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，在修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)上验证，比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标。

Result: 嵌入方法解释55%的人类数据维度相似性方差，多维缩放配置显示良好的因子一致性，与理论基础相符。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

TL;DR: 提出了MASLegalBench，一个专门为多智能体系统设计的法律基准测试，使用GDPR作为应用场景，通过角色化MAS架构评估LLM在法律任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律基准测试未考虑多智能体系统的独特优势，如任务分解、智能体专业化和灵活训练，这限制了MAS在法律领域的潜力。

Method: 基于演绎推理方法设计MASLegalBench基准，使用GDPR场景，手动设计多种角色化MAS架构，并用不同先进LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了现有模型和MAS架构的优势、局限性和潜在改进领域。

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估的空白，为未来MAS在法律任务中的发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，通过组合现有技能来获得复合能力，这类似于人类获取认知技能的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中的真实作用：是教授新技能还是仅激活现有能力，以澄清相关学术争议。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究LLM如何通过RL学习未见过的函数组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习未见过的函数组合，且这种组合能力可泛化到更复杂的多函数组合问题，并能迁移到不同任务中。

Conclusion: RL能从根本上改变模型的推理行为，建议先构建具有基础技能的基座模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决技能。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

TL;DR: 提出RLHI范式，通过用户自然交互学习持续改进模型，包含用户引导重写和基于用户奖励两种方法，在个性化和指令遵循方面优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家反馈进行对齐，但为了实现持续改进和多方面对齐，需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发两种互补方法：1）用户引导重写：基于用户自然语言后续响应修订不满意输出；2）基于用户奖励：通过基于用户长期交互历史（个人资料）的奖励模型学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面均优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 自然人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型智能体在持续任务流中无法从历史交互中学习，导致重复错误和浪费宝贵经验。

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体自我评判的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略，测试时检索相关记忆指导交互；MaTTS通过扩展智能体交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了效果和效率；MaTTS进一步增强了这些收益。

Conclusion: 内存驱动的经验扩展成为一种新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域有改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出MoVT范式，通过AdaVaR两阶段学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，然后通过RL过程使用AdaGRPO算法诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案，在各种场景下实现一致改进。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

TL;DR: AttAnchor是一个参数自由的框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型中的token局部性和跨模态对齐，减少幻觉并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖图像和文本token的直接拼接，导致跨模态语义相关token之间的注意力距离过长，造成幻觉和性能下降。

Method: 提出Attention Anchor框架，将文本token插入到相关的视觉patch附近，创建语义路标，引导模型关注正确的图像区域。

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中，13个获得提升，推理任务最高提升32%，幻觉基准最高提升15%。TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B，仅增加0.1%推理时间开销。

Conclusion: AttAnchor是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作，实现了跨模态语义聚类，显著改善了视觉语言模型的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

TL;DR: 本文探索了视觉语言过程奖励模型（VL-PRMs）的设计空间，提出了混合数据合成框架和感知聚焦监督方法，系统评估了多种测试时扩展策略，在多个多模态基准测试中取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要更有效的VL-PRM设计方法。

Method: 1) 结合MCTS与强VLM判断的混合数据合成框架；2) 感知聚焦监督，使PRM能显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试上的实验表明：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型优于过程步骤选择；小模型可匹配或超越大模型；能发掘强VLM的潜在推理能力；感知监督带来显著提升；在数学推理数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，为VLM发展提供了重要支持，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一个有效的锚点引导扩散框架，解决了现有方法在理论一致性和性能方面的限制，具有实时部署的潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Motivation: 现有零样本LLM视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述而过度简化视觉细节，要么处理原始图像输入而无法捕捉高层次推理所需的抽象语义。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述来促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理增强全局场景理解和空间推理能力。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了导航性能。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理，可以有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力，提高导航准确性。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Motivation: 长上下文支持带来了内存和计算挑战，现有基于注意力分数的token淘汰方法缺乏对token在注意力输出中贡献的信息。

Method: 提出CAOTE方法，通过注意力分数和值向量的无缝集成来优化token淘汰误差，是首个在闭式表达中使用值token的注意力淘汰方法。

Result: 与最先进的注意力分数方法结合时，CAOTE始终提高下游任务的准确率。

Conclusion: 在token淘汰过程中利用值向量的信息至关重要，CAOTE证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含所有特征交互但性能不如GAMs，需要一种既能保持可解释性又能提升性能的方法。

Method: MACMs由乘法部分和加法部分组成，通过加法部分解耦CESR中交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间。两部分都可以自然可视化形状函数，帮助用户理解特征在决策过程中的作用。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法和加法部分有效提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Motivation: 现有RLHF中的奖励模型学习方法使用固定margin或简单函数，无法处理不同偏好强度的变化，且依赖可能不可靠的偏好评分。

Method: 提出DPO-PoP方法，利用偏好间的比较信号（即哪个偏好反映更强的区分）来推断每个数据点的自适应margin。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP优于原始DPO、固定margin DPO和真实margin DPO，但发现判别性能和生成性能存在权衡。

Conclusion: 通过偏好间的监督信号可以学习自适应margin，并提出两种采样策略来平衡判别和生成性能的权衡。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

TL;DR: 该论文采用谱分析方法研究大语言模型训练过程中的表示几何变化，发现了预训练中三个一致的几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段的维度扩展、压缩寻求阶段的选择性保留，以及后训练对几何的不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型能力的形成过程。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩(RankMe)和特征谱衰减(α-ReQ)，分析OLMo(1B-7B)和Pythia(160M-12B)模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现了预训练中三个非单调几何阶段：初始表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段的维度扩展(与n-gram记忆峰值重合)、压缩寻求阶段的选择性方差保留。后训练中，SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求动态。

Conclusion: 模型能力的涌现与表示几何的阶段性变化密切相关，这些几何动态源于交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的相互作用，后训练方法对几何有不同影响，需要在性能与鲁棒性之间权衡。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的奖励塑造框架，通过Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，用Minkowski组合器将因果连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合，在保持准确性的同时提高推理的忠实性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小的因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: 引入因果增强策略优化(CE-PO)，通过Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，反事实硬化这些信号以抑制干扰线索，并使用Minkowski组合器将连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验结果显示，CE-PO比基线平均提高准确率5.49%（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO减少了奖励黑客攻击和不忠实的思维链推理，在保持接近同等准确性的同时提高了推理的忠实性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，需要一种能够有效捕捉时空模式的方法。

Method: 使用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，采用分层注意力机制捕捉日和周依赖，结合预计算提示嵌入来增强表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，RHYTHM相比最先进方法实现了2.4%的整体准确率提升，周末准确率提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM证明了LLM作为通用时空预测器和轨迹推理器的有效性，通过创新的时间标记化和分层注意力机制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在过度自信问题，阻碍了自感知推理模型的发展

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则器校准置信度与奖励

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面优于最先进方法

Conclusion: C²GSPG通过置信度校准和GSPG框架的协同作用，有效解决了强化学习中的过度自信问题

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个新颖的框架，通过将推测性解码与RL rollout过程集成，重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，避免了冗余生成，同时确保策略一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地依赖具有可验证奖励的强化学习来引发可靠的思维链推理。然而，训练过程仍然受到计算昂贵的rollout阶段的瓶颈限制。现有加速方法要么收益递减，引入偏差，要么忽略了迭代间的冗余。

Method: SPEC-RL识别出连续训练时期的rollout经常共享大量重叠段，浪费计算。该框架重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，并通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们。

Result: 在多种数学推理和泛化基准测试上的实验表明，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少了2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: 作为一个纯粹的rollout阶段增强，SPEC-RL与主流算法无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了一条通用且实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布偏移下往往性能下降，研究旨在探索仅使用历史数据时模型是否能有效泛化到未来数据。

Method: 探索了参数插值（历史模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出历史参数凸包的外推）两种方法，在语言建模、新闻摘要、卫星图像分类等多样化时序任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 实证结果显示，所有评估方法都无法在所有场景中持续优于简单使用最新模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据或对数据生成过程的强假设情况下，泛化到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对混合专家模型的专用缩放定律，解决了现有密集模型缩放定律不适用于MoE模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的缩放定律无法应用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在多重影响因素、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响等挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个控制实验来表征它们的边际效应，构建全面的联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关，随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可为未来MoE模型设计和训练提供准确且深入的指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Motivation: 解决监督微调(SFT)容易记忆化而强化学习(RL)计算成本高的问题，DFT作为折中方案存在不稳定性，需要改进。

Method: 基于奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析DFT，提出ASFT方法，在DFT重加权基础上增加轻量级KL正则化来保持紧致性并确保稳定性。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务中一致优于SFT和DFT，获得显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统视角，表明原则性理论分析既能带来更强的理论保证又能获得实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，研究LLMs中知识的结构组织模式，特别是知识同质性（相似实体具有相似知识水平），以提升知识密集型应用的效率。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图结构，分析实体间知识性关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识性评分，优先检查知识较少的triplet。

Result: 发现LLMs存在知识同质性模式，GNN模型能有效预测知识性评分，在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖，提升知识注入和多跳推理效率。

Conclusion: LLMs中的知识具有结构组织特性，基于知识同质性的GNN方法能有效优化知识管理和推理应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

Conclusion: 探索与利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，VERL方法成功实现了探索与利用的协同增强，突破了传统权衡限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出动态正交持续微调(DOC)，跟踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务参数梯度与历史功能方向正交以减少干扰。

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为连续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，成功缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Conclusion: 研究结果为LLM的离策略RL提供了可操作的见解，并为原则性算法设计开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Motivation: 现有方法存在灾难性遗忘严重、知识干扰和数据增强引入语义扭曲的问题，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案来处理少样本持续学习场景。

Method: 采用专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；结合标签描述的对比学习；以及防止过拟合的知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试中，LEAF持续实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义感知路由和知识保留策略，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: LLM对齐面临多目标偏好冲突的困境：提升一个维度往往以牺牲其他维度为代价。现有方法主要关注约束优化和数据选择，但忽视了在参数层面直接解决冲突的根本问题。

Method: OrthAlign利用正交子空间分解，将参数更新空间分解为相互正交的子空间，使不同偏好的优化在数学上互不干扰的方向进行，并提供理论保证确保稳定收敛。

Result: 实验显示：I. 在多目标对齐后，单偏好最大改进达34.61%-50.89%；II. 平均整体奖励提升13.96%。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解开创了解决多目标偏好对齐中梯度冲突的新范式，实现了稳定的多维度性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在顺序决策中探索能力不足，需要研究如何通过不同训练方法提升其探索策略和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 不同训练范式各有优劣，需要定制化奖励设计和超越平均遗憾的评估方法，以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Motivation: 探索在实用缩放配方下训练的LLM家族是否也存在损失曲线坍缩现象，以及这种现象的实际应用价值。

Method: 通过分析不同规模LLM的训练损失曲线，研究在宽度、深度、学习率、批量大小和权重衰减联合缩放时，损失曲线坍缩的条件和特征。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实会坍缩，且偏离坍缩可作为训练病理的早期诊断指标，坍缩曲线的可预测性支持大规模超参数调优中的早停策略。

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩现象是开发高效LLM的有效工具，通过训练Celerity LLM家族验证了这一洞察的实际价值。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SIREN方法解决强化学习中熵崩溃和早熟收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化限制探索范围，在数学基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在大规模推理模型中失效，导致熵爆炸和早熟收敛问题，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: SIREN采用两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码）和自锚定正则化形式，将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集中。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN平均性能优于现有方法，在AIME24/25上提升+6.6 maj@k，促进响应多样性并保持适当熵水平。

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了RLVR在LRM中的早熟收敛问题，维持验证通过率，为大规模推理模型的强化学习提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大推理模型存在重复思维模式，减少这些模式通常以性能下降为代价，需要克服这种权衡关系。

Method: 通过训练过程中动态调整最大rollout长度，在压缩阶段缩短长度迫使模型在有限上下文中做出精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制让模型探索长时程设置。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时token使用减少46.9%，SIRI-high达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 周期性振荡大推理模型的输出截断长度可以在训练中动态平衡探索和效率，收敛到两者之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估局部攻击的效果。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上系统评估局部对抗攻击。

Result: 局部攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算工作量增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（PGD、C&W）比单步方法（FGSM）对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 局部对抗攻击在不可感知性方面具有优势，但需要权衡计算成本和攻击成功率，为攻击策略改进和防御系统设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调多层感知机头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表示比基准线紧凑9倍、鲁棒性提高1.5倍，同时保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI句子相似性任务中，表示紧凑3.4倍、鲁棒性提高1.4倍。

Conclusion: 通过功能约束学习的鲁棒、超紧凑表示为从边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling是一种有效的解决方案，能够解决从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调时的子优迁移问题，为鲁棒迁移学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR)框架，通过将模型预测生成的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示。该框架作为自提示机制，让模型利用自身输出来优化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示往往包含与模型预测语义相矛盾的噪声类间相似性。GCR旨在解决这一问题，通过图一致性正则化来增强特征的语义结构。

Method: 引入参数免费的Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs)，在任意深度构建批次级特征相似图，并将其与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐。采用多层跨空间图对齐机制和自适应权重学习，让模型优先选择语义可靠的层。

Result: 实验表明GCR能够促进更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和更好的泛化性能，在各种网络和数据集上都能改善语义结构。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构中学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的框架，无需修改架构或训练过程即可提升特征质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了有效处理大规模数据集的聚类任务，需要开发能够降低计算复杂度同时保持准确性的算法。

Method: 使用粒度球技术，通过多采样数据集并构建多粒度粒度球，逐步揭示统计"骨架"作为数据的空间抽象。

Result: 在标准计算硬件上的大量实验表明，GBSK在大规模数据集上实现了高效率和强聚类性能，包括处理高达1亿个实例、256维的数据集。

Conclusion: GBSK算法通过粒度球技术成功解决了大规模数据聚类问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率，并提供了自适应版本AGBSK以增强实用性。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架，旨在解决医疗领域联邦学习部署中的实际操作挑战，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有工作忽视了这些实际编排挑战，因此需要自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个基于代理的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的真实世界联邦学习工作流程关键阶段，并引入了FedAgentBench基准测试来评估LLM代理自主协调医疗联邦学习的能力。该框架包含40种联邦学习算法，针对不同的任务需求和跨客户端特征进行定制。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能，涵盖小、中、大模型规模。结果显示，虽然某些代理核心（如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3）能够自动化联邦学习管道的各个阶段，但基于隐含目标的更复杂、相互依赖的任务对即使是最强大的模型也具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 基于智能代理的联邦学习框架可以有效解决医疗联邦学习部署中的操作挑战，但复杂任务仍需要进一步改进。该工作为自主联邦学习系统的发展提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: DART是一个用于GUI代理的解耦强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计和自适应数据管理，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在强化学习中面临的两个主要挑战：与GUI环境的多轮交互速度慢，以及用于策略学习的高质量代理-环境交互不足。

Method: 将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、rollout服务、数据管理器和训练器，采用非阻塞通信、异步训练、rollout轨迹采样和逐工作器模型同步。引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整rollout数量和轨迹长度、选择性训练高熵步骤，以及截断重要性采样。

Result: 显著提升系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量、5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理，有效解决了GUI代理强化学习的效率问题，显著提升了性能表现，并将完全开源以贡献给开源社区。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过融合稀疏和线性注意力来加速扩散模型中的注意力计算，实现20倍注意力计算减少和2.2倍端到端加速，且不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，特别是视频生成场景下，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且注意力具有二次复杂度。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N^2)注意力、O(N)注意力和跳过计算，并将这些计算融合到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现13.7倍注意力计算加速和2.2倍端到端视频生成加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过有效融合稀疏和线性注意力，显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算，为长序列生成任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPS-MTM是一个用于大规模移动数据的基础模型，通过将移动轨迹分解为状态和行动两种模态，使用双向Transformer和掩码建模目标来学习人类移动的正常模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在文本、视觉和视频理解方面取得了显著进展，现在有望在轨迹建模领域实现类似突破。现有方法将轨迹扁平化为坐标流，无法充分捕捉移动的语义相关性。

Method: 将移动轨迹分解为状态（兴趣点类别）和行动（代理转移）两种互补模态，使用双向Transformer和自监督掩码建模目标，跨模态重建缺失片段。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife等基准数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等下游任务中持续优于其他方法，在动态任务（逆向和正向动力学）中优势最明显。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM为轨迹分析建立了一个稳健的基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一流模态。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个开放获取的室内水产养殖环境质量数据集，记录了6种IEQ变量，填补了智能水产养殖信息学中的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集，限制了预测和异常检测工具的发展，因此需要创建这样的数据集来支持智能水产养殖系统。

Method: 使用单个Awair HOME监测器在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样，记录空气温度、相对湿度、二氧化碳、总挥发性有机化合物、PM2.5和PM10等6个变量，采用ISO标准安装高度，并进行校准检查和质量控制。

Result: 产生了超过23,000个时间戳观测数据，显示稳定的环境条件（中位CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米），有明显的喂食时间峰值，为短期预测和事件检测提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据驱动的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

TL;DR: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高，而等变模型虽然在某些任务中精度更高，但计算需求大。现有等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了表达能力和性能。

Method: 使用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，实现O(N log N)计算复杂度，利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性支持高阶不可约特征，并通过权重共享或数据增强实现可选token置换等变性。

Result: 在n-body模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集等多个基准测试中，在GPU内存大小、速度和准确性方面均优于现有等变transformer。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能，为等变transformer的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入伪影，需要一种能保持视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的方法。

Method: 使用耦合SDEs，通过相同相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，引导采样过程向目标语义靠近。

Result: 方法实现高提示保真度和接近像素级的一致性，在扩散模型和整流流模型上均有效。

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，使用固定教师模型替代EMA更新，通过两阶段训练实现更高效、可扩展的视频表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA中的EMA机制虽然防止表示崩溃，但增加了模型选择的复杂性并耦合了师生架构。研究重新审视掩码潜在预测，发现固定教师模型已足够。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段用像素重建目标训练教师编码器，第二阶段冻结教师，训练学生模型预测掩码区域的教师潜在表示。

Result: SALT学生模型在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，在相同FLOPs下获得更高精度，且对教师质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，建议计算预算应主要分配给学生模型。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在解决逆问题时，通常使用固定尺度来平衡先验得分和似然得分，这种静态设计在不同时间步和任务中表现不佳，限制了性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SAIP插件模块，无需重新训练或修改扩散主干网络，在每个时间步自适应地优化尺度参数，可无缝集成到现有采样器中。

Result: SAIP在多种图像恢复任务中持续提升重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景。

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型存在模态对齐不足的问题，某些模态可能未被有效对齐，影响下游任务性能。需要一种能确保所有模态有效对齐的方法。

Method: TRIANGLE：三模态神经几何学习，直接在模态嵌入的高维空间中计算三角形面积相似度，避免额外的融合层或成对相似度计算。

Result: 在视频-文本、音频-文本检索和音频-视频分类等三模态任务中，TRIANGLE达到最先进结果，比基于余弦的方法Recall@1提升高达9个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIANGLE通过几何相似度有效改进多模态对齐，提供可解释的对齐原理，显著提升多模态建模性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SimA攻击方法，一种针对扩散模型的单查询成员推理攻击，通过分析去噪器输出向量的范数来检测训练样本成员身份。研究发现潜在扩散模型比像素空间模型更安全，并提出了增强LDM训练鲁棒性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型可能无意中泄露训练数据集的成员信息，这引发了严重的隐私担忧。现有成员推理攻击方法需要多次查询，效率较低。

Method: 基于理论分析发现去噪器输出指向训练样本的核加权局部均值，其范数编码了与训练集的接近程度。提出SimA单查询攻击方法，利用这一原理进行高效的成员推理。

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM等扩散模型变体上均表现出色。发现潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的强信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更安全。通过调整β-VAE中的正则化超参数可以增强LDM训练对MIA的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE的反演问题，而不仅仅是扩散过程的反演。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

*Zhitao Wang,Yanke Wang,Jiangtao Wen,Roberto Horowitz,Yuxing Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReSeFlow：一种基于SE(3)-等变网络和整流流的快速轨迹生成方法，在机器人操作任务中实现高效推理和鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SE(3)-等变扩散模型在推理时间上的高成本问题，同时保持数据效率和鲁棒性，适用于非结构化环境中的机器人操作。

Method: 将整流流引入SE(3)-扩散模型，使用SE(3)-等变网络保持旋转和平移对称性，实现测地线一致的最小计算策略生成。

Result: 仅需一步推理即可超越基线方法的100步推理性能，在绘画任务上误差减少48.5%，旋转三角形任务上减少21.9%。

Conclusion: ReSeFlow结合了SE(3)等变性和整流流的优势，为生成式策略学习模型在真实世界应用提供了数据和推理效率。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 人类演示受益于丰富的运动捕捉数据和互联网资源，而机器人操作训练样本有限，需要弥合人类与机器人操作能力之间的差距。

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While human
demonstrations benefit from abundant motion capture data and vast internet
resources, robotic manipulation suffers from limited training examples. To
bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose
UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from
human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three
key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery
mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate
and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive
prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic
systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human
manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency
and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will
be released upon acceptance at an anonymous repository.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出A2C2方法，通过轻量级实时动作块校正头解决VLA模型动作分块导致的响应性下降问题，无需重新训练基础策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型使用动作分块提高效率和时序一致性，但会损害在推理延迟和长时域下的响应性。

Method: A2C2在每个控制步骤运行，结合最新观测、VLA预测的基础动作、基础动作在块中的位置特征和基础策略特征，输出逐步校正。

Result: 在动态Kinetix任务套件和LIBERO Spatial上，相比RTC方法，在增加延迟和执行时域下分别获得23%和7%的成功率提升，即使在零延迟下也能改善长时域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: A2C2是部署高容量分块策略到实时控制的有效即插即用机制，具有最小开销。

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

TL;DR: RAVEN是一个基于3D记忆和行为树框架的空中语义导航系统，专为户外非结构化环境设计，结合了语义体素-射线地图、长短程搜索策略和大视觉语言模型，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义导航方法主要针对室内环境，受限于空间范围和结构化布局，不适合长距离户外搜索。户外方法要么依赖反应式策略导致短视行为，要么依赖离线预计算场景图，缺乏在线部署的适应性。

Method: 使用空间一致的语义体素-射线地图作为持久记忆，结合短程体素搜索和长程射线搜索，利用大视觉语言模型提供辅助线索，通过行为树协调自适应切换行为。

Result: 在10个逼真户外模拟环境中进行100个语义任务测试，RAVEN比基线方法性能提升85.25%，并在真实空中机器人户外实地测试中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架通过3D记忆、多尺度搜索策略和智能行为协调，有效解决了户外长距离语义导航的挑战，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

TL;DR: Oat-VLA提出了一种面向对象的视觉语言动作模型tokenization方法，通过减少视觉token数量实现高效训练，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在适应机器人领域时计算成本过高，主要问题在于视觉输入的tokenization方案效率低下。

Method: 基于对象中心表示学习，引入对场景对象和智能体自身视觉信息的归纳偏置，将视觉token数量大幅减少到仅几个token。

Result: 在LIBERO套件上收敛速度至少比OpenVLA快两倍，在多样化真实世界拾放任务中表现优于OpenVLA。

Conclusion: Oat-VLA通过高效的tokenization方案实现了VLA模型的高效训练，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

TL;DR: SPARTA是首个针对物体状态变化操作任务的统一框架，通过空间进展性物体变化分割图来感知可操作区域与已变换区域，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励，支持强化学习和贪心控制两种策略变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数机器人操作关注物体的运动状态变化，但现实世界中许多任务涉及物体物理和视觉状态的渐进变化（如捣碎、涂抹、切片），这些任务需要新的处理框架。

Method: 基于物体状态变化具有空间进展性、物体中心化变化的共同结构模式，SPARTA整合空间进展性物体变化分割图，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励，采用强化学习和贪心控制两种策略。

Result: 在真实机器人上验证了3个具有挑战性的任务和10种不同的真实物体，相比稀疏奖励和视觉目标条件基线，在训练时间和准确性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 进展感知的视觉表示是更广泛物体状态操作任务家族的通用基础，SPARTA为这类任务提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合学习式初始化和优化式精化的RGB-D SLAM方法，通过相机位姿回归网络预测相对位姿作为优化起点，解决了不稳定相机运动下的实时稠密场景重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RGB-D SLAM系统在相机经历大视角变化、快速运动或突然抖动时会失效。传统优化方法精度高但需要良好初始化，而学习方法鲁棒性强但精度不足。

Method: 使用相机位姿回归网络从连续RGB-D帧预测度量感知的相对位姿，作为随机优化算法的可靠起点，进一步将深度图像与场景几何对齐。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中优于最佳竞争对手，在稳定运动序列上保持相当精度，系统能够实时运行。

Conclusion: 结合简单且原理性技术可以同时实现不稳定运动下的鲁棒性和稠密重建的精度。

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

Conclusion: CEDex通过桥接人类抓取运动学和机器人运动学，实现了有效的跨形态灵巧抓取合成，为多样化机器人操作提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Conclusion: DRCP框架有效解决了协同感知中的关键问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in

Motivation: 随着机器人从受控环境转向非结构化人类环境，构建能够可靠遵循自然语言指令的通用智能体仍是一个核心挑战。现有的多模态数据集缺乏同步的力扭矩传感、分层注释和明确的失败案例。

Method: 创建了包含25,469个片段（约94小时）的数据集，使用人形支持机器人（HSR）收集，采用同步的多模态数据采集和创新的两层注释模式（子目标和原始动作）。

Result: 数据集已标准化为LeRobot v2.1格式，并在HuggingFace上公开可用。

Conclusion: 通过独特地整合移动操作、接触丰富的交互和长时程结构，AIRoA MoMa为推进下一代视觉-语言-动作模型提供了关键基准。

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

Result: 新闻稿内容与盈利惊喜具有同等预测能力，FinBERT表现最佳。股价在开盘时已完全反映新闻稿信息，若存在信息泄露则提供预测优势。主题分析显示管理层叙述存在自利偏差。

Conclusion: 文本分析框架支持实时收益预测，提供可解释性，揭示了语言在价格形成中的微妙作用，证明新闻稿内容对股票市场具有重要信息价值。

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock
returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from
2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We
find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as
earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest
predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and
interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect
the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it
offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in
managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction
through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and

Result: MTAM在测试商业软件时达到16.7%-51.1%的错误发现率，在测试学术算法时达到45.7%的错误发现率。

Conclusion: MTAM框架能有效发现音频内容审核软件的漏洞，证明现有系统在面对对抗性音频输入时存在显著缺陷。

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp
and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content
in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to
disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive
advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative
consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response,
researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio
content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious
actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio
content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the
effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs
remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a
Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software.
Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14
metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based
and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic
audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more
likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five
commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against
three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%,
18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing
commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu,
Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when
testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

### [692] [DiffTester: Accelerating Unit Test Generation for Diffusion LLMs via Repetitive Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24975)
*Lekang Yang,Yuetong Liu,Yitong Zhang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DiffTester是一个针对扩散语言模型的单元测试生成加速框架，通过动态识别测试代码中的重复结构模式，在保持测试质量的同时提高生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在单元测试生成中逐个token生成效率低下，而扩散LLM虽然支持并行生成但存在效率与质量的权衡问题，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 基于抽象语法树分析动态识别单元测试中的重复结构模式，自适应增加每步生成的token数量而不影响输出质量。

Result: 在三个基准测试和两种代表性模型上的实验表明，DiffTester在保持测试覆盖率的同时实现了显著加速，且在不同dLLM和编程语言上泛化良好。

Conclusion: DiffTester为软件开发中的高效单元测试生成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes
the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important.
However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each
forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs)
have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing
strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application
to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test
quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often
causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this
limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically
tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests
targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By
dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree
analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of
tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To
enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark,
which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages
including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two
representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration
while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across
different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable
solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly
available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

### [693] [YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070)
*Po-Heng Chou,Wei-Lung Mao,Ru-Ping Lin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的框架，使用连续小波变换的时频谱图进行轴承故障诊断，在多个数据集上达到高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障诊断方法难以捕捉瞬态故障特征，且缺乏对故障位置的可视化能力，需要更准确和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 将一维振动信号通过Morlet小波变换为时频谱图，然后使用YOLOv9、v10、v11模型进行分类和故障定位。

Result: 在CWRU、PU和IMS数据集上，YOLOv11分别达到99.4%、97.8%和99.5%的mAP分数，显著优于基线MCNN-LSTM模型。

Conclusion: CWT-YOLO框架在轴承故障诊断中表现出高精度、强泛化能力和故障位置可视化优势，为旋转机械状态监测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault
diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into
time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault
signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11
models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets,
including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU),
and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline
achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline
MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8%
(PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism
enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a
practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动睡眠分期方法通常从复杂的PSG信号中提取特征并训练领域特定模型，缺乏直观性且需要大量专业数据集。

Method: 将原始一维PSG时间序列转换为直观的二维波形图像，然后微调多模态大模型来学习这些表示。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法使通用模型能够获得稳健的分期能力，且在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学应用中具有高效性和实用价值，能够模仿人类专家基于PSG图像的视觉诊断工作流程。

Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing
neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from
complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which
often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages
large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic
practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into
intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large
model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets
(ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose
models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging
capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic
the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG
images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for
medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG
image dataset will be released.
