### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StreetMath基准，用于评估大语言模型在真实世界近似场景下的近似推理能力，发现LLMs在需要近似计算的任务中仍倾向于计算精确值或调用外部工具，且近似和精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在精确算术运算中的表现，而对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，在不同LLM架构上进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探测其内部计算状态。

Result: LLMs在近似任务中仍尝试计算精确值或调用外部工具；模型有时在早期层或步骤得到正确答案，但解决近似任务时仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLMs在街算场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似推理能力有待提升。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，用于对产品评论进行情感强度和极性分类，实现更精确的实体排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑情感强度差异，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同强度的情感表达。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法对情感词进行分类，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面相关的情感词，通过副词、形容词、名词和动词等情感词来评估特定方面的情感强度。

Result: 能够将情感表达分类为非常弱、弱、中等、非常强和强五个粒度级别，实现更精确的情感强度分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地分析评论中的情感强度和极性，为基于用户查询的实体排名提供更精细的情感分析支持。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了LASTIST数据集，这是一个大规模韩语目标无关立场检测数据集，包含563,299个标注句子，填补了韩语立场检测研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中于目标相关任务且基于英语数据，韩语等低资源语言缺乏相应数据集，限制了立场检测模型的发展。

Method: 从韩国政党新闻稿中收集数据，构建包含563,299个标注韩语句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练最先进的深度学习模型进行验证。

Result: 成功构建了大规模韩语立场检测数据集，支持目标无关立场检测和时间演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，促进了低资源语言立场检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA零延迟融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上实现零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs部署中，任务特定的适配器参数虽然只占基础模型的不到1%，但在推理时会产生高达2.5倍的计算开销，这在实际应用中是不可接受的。

Method: 开发了零延迟融合低秩适配器(zFLoRA)，通过融合技术将适配器参数整合到基础模型中，避免额外的推理延迟。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLMs上，zFLoRA在18个不同任务上的表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调(FFT)。在NPU和GPU平台上均显示零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Conclusion: zFLoRA提供了一种高效的适配器解决方案，在保持性能的同时消除了推理延迟问题，适用于多下游应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了机械可解释性中电路发现的三个关键改进：使用自助法识别一致性边、基于比率的边选择策略、以及整数线性规划方法，在多个任务和模型上优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械可解释性中的主要挑战是电路发现，即确定模型的哪些部分执行特定任务。基于MIB基准，需要改进现有电路发现方法以获得更忠实和性能更好的电路。

Method: 1. 使用自助法识别具有一致归因得分的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先选择强正得分边；3. 用整数线性规划替换标准贪心选择方法。

Result: 所提出的方法在多个MIB任务和模型上产生了更忠实的电路，并优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过自助法、比率选择策略和整数线性规划的组合改进，显著提升了电路发现的忠实性和性能，为机械可解释性研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用LLM作为零样本偏好预言机，通过自然语言指导从多目标选项中选择最佳方案，包含参数化方法LISTEN-U和非参数化方法LISTEN-T。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家在多个竞争目标下从大量选项中选择最佳方案时的困难，特别是难以形式化复杂隐含偏好的问题。

Method: 提出LISTEN框架，使用LLM作为偏好预言机，包含两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U（参数化效用函数优化）和LISTEN-T（非参数化锦标赛选择）。

Result: 在航班预订、购物、考试安排等任务中，LISTEN-U在偏好参数对齐时表现优异，LISTEN-T提供更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 探索了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter是一个用于长上下文预训练的数据筛选框架，通过对比长上下文与短上下文设置下的模型预测来识别具有长距离依赖性的训练样本，显著提升了模型在长上下文任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，大部分内容仅通过局部上下文即可预测，导致训练效率低下，因此需要精心筛选训练数据。

Method: LongFilter通过对比模型在长上下文与短上下文设置下的预测差异，来衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，从而识别那些长距离依赖关系至关重要的样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K的实验表明，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，并在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter框架为长上下文预训练提供了有效的数据筛选方法，能够识别具有真正长距离依赖性的训练样本，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，角色设定会影响LLM在有害内容分类中的公平性和一致性，不同意识形态的角色会形成不同的判断倾向，导致模型输出存在隐性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM在内容审核系统中的公平性和中立性，探索角色设定如何影响模型对不同内容类型的判断。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态，比较不同意识形态角色在有害内容分类中的表现，并进行一致性分析和政治倾向性测试。

Result: 表面指标显示角色对分类准确性影响不大，但深入分析发现不同意识形态角色对内容危害性的判断存在显著差异，大模型更倾向于与同意识形态角色保持一致。

Conclusion: 角色设定会在LLM输出中引入隐性意识形态偏见，这对号称中立的AI系统使用提出了警示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答任务中实现了更好的性能，F1分数达到0.90，比基于嵌入的检索方法高出0.04，同时减少了70%以上的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)中的临床文档以base64编码附件形式存储在FHIR DocumentReference资源中，这使得语义问答变得困难。传统向量数据库方法常常错过细微的临床关系。

Method: 临床实体增强检索(CLEAR)方法，使用实体感知检索技术。开发了临床笔记问答评估平台，用于验证CLEAR与零样本大上下文推理和传统基于分块的检索增强生成的对比。

Result: 在12个临床笔记(10,000-65,000 tokens)上测试，CLEAR获得了58.3%的胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，比宽上下文处理减少了78%的token使用。对于超过65,000 tokens的长文档，胜率达到75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索在临床自然语言处理中同时提高了效率和准确性。评估框架为评估临床问答系统提供了可重用和透明的基准，其中语义精度和计算效率至关重要。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动标注在框架多样性上优于纯人工标注，而全自动标注除标注时间外其他指标均表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM应用在语言资源创建中已有实际应用，但对其在标注数据集创建中的性能和影响，特别是从NLP视角进行的全面评估仍然缺乏。

Method: 比较了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：人工标注、自动标注和半自动标注，使用基于LLM的语义角色标注器进行FrameNet式语义标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了框架多样性并保持相似的标注覆盖率，而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现明显较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在语义标注任务中具有优势，能够提高多样性同时保持覆盖率，而全自动方法在质量上仍有不足。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个代理式管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM输出中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包括越狱模块处理对齐拒绝，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著提升提取效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要找到可靠的方法来验证模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型自由重现目标内容

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，比较输出与参考段落并识别差异，然后转化为最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成，还包括检测和克服对齐拒绝的越狱模块

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试（涵盖30多本完整书籍）上，RECAP相比单次迭代方法有显著提升，GPT-4.1提取受版权保护文本的ROUGE-L平均分从0.38提高到0.47，增长近24%

Conclusion: RECAP通过反馈驱动循环和越狱模块有效提升了从LLM中提取记忆训练数据的能力，为验证模型训练数据提供了可靠方法

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言训练中的常见假设，发现适当平衡的多语言数据可以提升语言模型能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源语言中也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间权衡的争议（即多语言诅咒问题）。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的语言模型，在25到400种语言的不同多语言语料库上进行实验，研究英语作为枢纽语言的作用。

Result: 1) 英语和多语言数据结合不会降低任一组的语言内性能；2) 英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益；3) 在此规模模型中没有观察到明显的多语言诅咒效应。

Conclusion: 多语言数据在适当平衡时可以增强语言模型能力，而不会损害性能，即使对于低资源语言也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译在低资源语言中生成合成数据时，由于文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域，LLMs编码的文化知识会放大这种漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保存的影响，现有研究忽视了文化因素在翻译过程中的作用。

Method: 通过跨文化敏感和中性领域的实验，分析不同MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译过程中的标签漂移现象。

Result: 发现MT系统（包括LLMs）在翻译中会导致标签漂移，LLMs编码的文化知识会放大漂移，文化相似性是标签保存的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视文化因素会损害标签保真度，并可能导致下游应用中的误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提高了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成导致未经验证和算术上不可靠的解决方案，现有方法缺乏确定性验证机制。

Method: 引入SymCode框架，将数学问题解决重构为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎为LLM推理提供确定性基础。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且具有更高的token效率。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎上，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能矩阵乘法（matmul）计算核心，通过内核融合和新型缓存策略优化LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了有吸引力的异构架构选项，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，定制化设计了一系列技术，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，相比AWS现有最佳实现，matmul核心平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 提出的优化技术显著提升了Trainium上LLM推理的矩阵乘法性能，证明了定制化方法在AI加速器上的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache是一个加速LLM预填充推理阶段的框架，通过检索和重用相似的注意力图来减少自注意力计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载（如分类、问答等）仅使用LLM的预填充阶段，而自注意力计算因其二次复杂度成为性能瓶颈。研究发现不同语义的句子在不同层和头中会产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理时识别并重用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: 实验结果显示，在CPU上平均实现1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上平均实现1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache能有效加速LLM预填充推理，通过重用相似注意力图显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，通过内部推理独白和基于专家动作相似性的平滑奖励，解决小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解决方案很少被采样时失败，而监督微调则容易通过僵化的逐令牌模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL框架将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑动作序列，训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白。它基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供平滑奖励，即使在所有rollout都不正确时也能提供丰富的学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习之前SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强整体性能。SRL还能有效泛化到代理软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是一个强大且多功能的训练框架，适用于面向推理的LLMs，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种正确的工具调用轨迹来提高模型在动态环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用的工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态变化的工具调用环境中表现有限。

Method: 使用强化学习方法：1)为给定查询生成多个轨迹，形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力为每个步骤分配奖励；3)计算分叉相对优势和轨迹相对优势来训练LLM。

Result: 在17种工具的实验环境中，PORTool相比其他训练方法在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种正确轨迹的方法，有效提升了工具使用LLM在动态环境中的性能表现。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架来分析跨语言对齐中的权衡，发现现有方法在改善事实传递的同时会导致文化擦除，并提出了一种新的推理时方法来平衡这两个目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐虽然有助于知识跨语言传递，但可能导致文化擦除问题，即模型无法提供基于查询语言的文化特定响应。本文旨在系统分析这种权衡。

Method: 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架，重新评估现有CLA方法，并提出Surgical Steering方法——通过在模型不同层应用有针对性的激活引导来分离事实传递和文化特定知识。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在六种语言中都一致地以牺牲文化本地化为代价来改善事实传递，且事实传递和文化特定知识在模型的不同层中具有最优可控性。

Conclusion: Surgical Steering方法能够更好地平衡事实传递和文化本地化这两个竞争维度，有效克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了基于NLP的管道来识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，发现7.8%的患者存在ITFs，这些发现与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关，需要标准化报告和选择性随访。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偶发甲状腺发现在非甲状腺指征的影像检查中日益增多，但其流行率、特征和临床后果尚未明确界定。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的NLP管道从多个影像模态和身体区域的报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有ITFs，其中92.9%为结节。ITFs患者甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。大多数癌症为乳头状癌，且检测时体积更大。

Conclusion: ITFs常见且与导致发现小型低风险癌症的级联效应密切相关，强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用，需要标准化报告和更选择性随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Result: GPT-4o准确率仅18.97%，而推理模型o3达到78%准确率，优于人类代码平均成功率39.98%。

Conclusion: 量子编程对LLM具有挑战性，推理模型表现更优，发布数据集和API支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Motivation: 传统1P1S训练导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展的效果，需要增加推理路径的多样性。

Method: 提出1PNS训练范式，引入RPD指标衡量思维链差异，基于RPD选择多样化解决方案集进行微调。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base上实验，RPD选择的训练集带来更多样化输出和更高pass@k，pass@16平均提升2.80%，AIME24上提升4.99%。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效增强测试时扩展的效果，通过增加推理多样性提升模型性能。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和话语关系的数据集，研究旨在探索这两者之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集作为基础，开发了基于4个LLM和10种提示的40个话语关系分类器，通过多数投票策略创建了5个银标注数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种话语关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中至关重要，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和引发怀疑时。

Conclusion: 这项研究为检测网络宣传和错误信息提供了重要见解，并增进了我们对有效沟通的理解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Conclusion: MossNet为高效、高性能的循环LLM架构提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在指令遵循任务中可能存在统计效率不高的问题，需要改进模型以减少弃权并提高生成内容的质量。

Method: 使用监督微调方法，在预训练的Transformer语言模型基础上添加SDM激活层，通过对比输入编码方案和在线生成硬负样本进行训练。

Result: SDM语言模型相比强监督基线减少了弃权率，提高了统计效率。

Conclusion: SDM方法能够有效提升语言模型在指令遵循任务中的性能，通过简单的微调即可实现更好的校准和生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格，引入交叉响应相似性(CRS)来衡量风格自一致性，并在十个LLM和四个推理基准上进行实验。

Result: 实验显示指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一个原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，一致性可作为模型可靠性的有价值代理指标。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型在实际应用中存在更新遗忘问题，即均匀且上下文无关的更新会导致token级波动，抹去先前的语义编辑并破坏累积细化过程，从而降低流畅性和连贯性。

Method: 提出TTA方法，通过为每个token分配时间步调度实现软语义token排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续细化。这可以作为固定策略或由任务信号驱动的自适应策略实现。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，TTA将准确率提高超过20%，困惑度几乎减半，且仅使用不到五分之一的时间步；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释特征来理解偏好数据的编码内容，揭示不同数据集的人类偏好差异，并支持数据筛选和个性化应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但实践者缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解。现有方法需要预先指定假设，难以自动提取相关特征。

Method: 引入WIMHF方法，使用稀疏自编码器解释反馈数据，表征数据集能够测量的偏好和标注者实际表达的偏好。

Result: 在7个数据集中，WIMHF识别出少量人类可解释特征，这些特征占黑盒模型偏好预测信号的大部分。揭示了人类偏好的广泛多样性，以及数据集上下文的作用。

Conclusion: WIMHF为实践者提供了以人为中心的分析方法，以更好地理解和利用偏好数据，支持有效的数据筛选和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GlobalQA基准来评估全局RAG能力，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来解决现有方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（从少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力（跨整个文档集合聚合分析信息）。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过分块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并加入聚合模块进行精确符号计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，显著优于最强基线的1.51 F1。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG有效解决了全局RAG任务，验证了多工具协作框架在提升全局信息聚合能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含意义在人类交流中至关重要，语言模型也需要具备这种能力。研究探索如何通过语用学理论提示来增强语言模型的语用推理能力。

Method: 提出将格莱斯语用学和关联理论等语用学理论概述作为提示词，引导语言模型进行逐步推理来得出最终解释。

Result: 相比不使用语用学理论的中介推理提示方法，该方法在语用推理任务上提升了9.6%的得分。即使仅提及理论名称，在大型模型中也能获得1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为上下文学习提示是提升语言模型理解隐含意义能力的有效方法。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续向少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 在10种语言上评估多个预训练语言模型（包括大语言模型），使用明确指令和上下文信息进行借词识别测试。

Result: 模型在区分借词和本土词汇方面表现不佳，证实了现代NLP系统存在对借词而非本土等效词的偏见。

Conclusion: 这项工作对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具以及在主导语言词汇压力下支持语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文对多语言视觉语言模型的知识蒸馏进行了实证研究，发现在模型压缩过程中，不同蒸馏方法对跨语言表示一致性和下游任务性能稳定性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，特别是在模型尺寸减小时问题更加严重。知识蒸馏在将大模型知识迁移到小模型方面表现良好，但在多语言环境下的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了五种知识蒸馏方法，在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上进行实验，评估了领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务。

Result: 发现某些蒸馏配置即使模型尺寸减半也能保持或提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法反映的设计敏感性权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有潜力，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以确保跨语言和跨任务的性能稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，通过分析神经元激活模式而非外部输出来改进LLM推理，实现无监督的最佳候选选择，显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估）进行候选评分，但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。作者发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息。

Method: 基于神经元激活分析提出NAD方法：1）利用激活稀疏性（正确回答激活更少神经元）；2）利用跨样本神经元一致性（正确回答激活模式更一致）。无需文本输出比较即可选择最佳候选。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64；通过早期停止减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无监督集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，支持早期正确性预测和激进早期停止。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释LLM在数字嵌入表示准确性与输出错误之间的冲突，探索语言模型如何处理数字并量化这些机制的准确性下限。

Method: 通过分析不同LLM的隐藏状态和输入上下文，创建通用探针来追踪信息（包括输出错误的原因）到特定层。

Result: 发现不同语言模型学习到了可互换、系统化且高度准确的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入上下文中具有普遍性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLM如何操作数字提供了基本理解，并指出了更准确探针技术在改进LLM架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: 对ChatGPT Atlas在网页游戏中的交互能力进行早期评估，发现其在逻辑推理任务表现出色，但在需要精确时机的实时游戏中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ChatGPT Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出能力，但其在动态交互环境中的性能尚未充分探索，因此使用网页游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world等浏览器游戏作为测试场景，以游戏内性能得分作为量化指标评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现困难，往往无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: Atlas展示了强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在显著局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

<details>

Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署面临的隐私担忧、计算资源限制和教学有效性三大挑战，需要能够在本地运行且能可靠输出正确信息的小型开源模型。

Method: 结合领域特定工具和自我反思推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复，通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或超过更大模型的质量，学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE证明了在低资源、隐私敏感的教育应用中部署小型语言模型的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在需要深度原理性理解的专业领域（如经济学、心理学）表现不佳，需要解决这一领域差距。

Method: ACER首先为特定学科生成目录，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问题-答案对，构建系统性课程。使用交错课程调度进行持续预训练，在内容和认知维度上对齐学习。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在专业MMLU子集上显著提升：微观经济学准确率提高5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点，非目标领域也提升0.7点。在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个绝对点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一个可扩展且有效的方法来缩小LLMs在关键领域的差距，同时防止灾难性遗忘并促进跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 健康相关的错误信息非常普遍且具有潜在危害，特别是当这些主张扭曲或曲解科学发现时，很难被识别。

Method: 提出MisSynth管道，应用检索增强生成(RAG)来生成合成谬误样本，然后使用这些样本来微调大型语言模型(LLM)。

Result: 微调后的模型相比原始基线有显著准确率提升，LLaMA 3.1 8B微调模型在MISSCI测试集上的F1分数比原始基线绝对提升了35%以上。

Conclusion: 通过引入合成谬误数据来增强有限的标注资源，可以显著提高LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务上的零样本分类性能，即使在计算资源有限的情况下。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现功能一致的模型组，反映其潜在专业化；识别的协同团队在下游基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知模型专业化的手动策划团队达到相当准确度。

Conclusion: 为协作式多智能体LLM团队的自动化设计提供了新的基础，证明了基于交互的方法在团队构建中的有效性。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Conclusion: LLM在教育领域的应用仍面临重大挑战，当前模型性能与人类智能存在明显差距，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大型语言模型，无需额外训练就能在保持性能的同时实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然表现出色，但带宽和计算需求限制了广泛应用。现有方法如剪枝和低秩逼近各自有效，但它们的协同作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于理论分析，将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上测试，SSLC无需额外训练就超越单独方法，达到SOTA结果。压缩Qwen2.5 50%无性能损失，至少1.63倍加速。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，通过协同稀疏和低秩压缩实现高性能压缩。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前领域专用LLM缺乏透明度、微调成本高、需要大量提示工程、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境影响等问题。

Method: BNLF框架通过贝叶斯网络将多个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点，进行后期融合。使用FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个模型。

Result: 在三个具有不同语言和上下文特征的人工标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM准确率一致提升约6%，显示出对数据集变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 概率融合方法在可解释情感分类中有效，BNLF框架能够提高模型性能并保持对数据集变化的稳健性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 研究比较了使用多个LLM代理的集成方法与传统单一LLM在评估AI分诊工具性能方面的差异，发现LLM集成能提供更可靠的地面真值评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否能比单一LLM提供更可靠的像素级AI分诊工具评估。

Method: 分析了29,766例非对比CT头部检查，使用8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o的集成方法，通过多轮提示评估颅内出血情况，并与手动审查的1,726例进行比较。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳（AUC=0.78）。LLM集成方法（Full-9、Top-3、Consensus）在MCC指标上均优于单一GPT-4o，且集成方法间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成比单一LLM能提供更一致可靠的临床AI分诊工具回顾性评估方法。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: 本文对CORE-KG框架进行消融研究，量化其核心组件（共指消解模块和结构化提示）在减少节点重复和噪声方面的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从复杂法律文本构建知识图谱时面临的节点重复和噪声问题，传统LLM方法缺乏引导提取和共指消解能力。

Method: 对CORE-KG框架进行系统消融研究，分别移除共指消解模块和结构化提示，比较节点重复率和噪声节点增加情况。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示对减少噪声节点更关键，共指消解对减少节点重复更重要，为设计稳健的LLM知识图谱提取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: DIVRIT是一个希伯来语变音符号恢复系统，将任务构建为零样本分类问题，使用视觉语言模型处理未加变音符号的文本图像，在候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语变音符号恢复对于确保准确发音和消除文本歧义至关重要，尽管未加变音符号时语言存在高度歧义性，但机器学习方法已显著提升了该任务的性能。

Method: 将变音符号恢复构建为零样本分类问题，在单词级别操作，从动态生成的候选集中为每个未加变音符号的单词选择最合适的变音模式，使用希伯来视觉语言模型将未加变音符号的文本作为图像处理。

Result: 在正确变音形式保证在候选集中的"oracle"设置下，DIVRIT实现了高准确率。通过架构增强和优化训练方法，系统整体泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面的潜力。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现它们不是编码特定关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性，这种属性中心的结构解释了其高压缩性和有限泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统性地研究多关系解码器的组织结构，解释其高压缩性的原因。

Method: 使用简单的三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议，将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主题。

Result: 发现线性映射不编码不同关系，而是提取重复的粗粒度语义属性（如国家属性），关系解码器集合可被高度压缩而不显著损失精度。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而非关系特定的，这解释了其压缩性和仅对语义相近的新关系泛化的原因。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: InfoFlow框架通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三个方法，解决强化学习中奖励密度低的问题，显著提升探索效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在深度搜索场景中面临奖励密度低的挑战，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这阻碍了RLVR方法的应用。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：为停滞轨迹注入纠正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用研究者和精炼者双智能体架构压缩感知轨迹。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性地提高奖励密度，有效解决了深度搜索中的探索效率问题，为强化学习在复杂任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型由于自回归设计和庞大尺寸面临显著的推理延迟问题，现有推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进，但往往忽略了GPU设备和批处理大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，综合考虑GPU配置、批处理大小等推理成本因素，动态优化树结构。

Result: 在六个不同任务和六个不同LLM上的综合实验表明，该方法相比传统解码方法速度提升最高达5.2倍，普遍优于现有最先进技术5%-20%。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统级推理成本因素来动态优化树结构，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了LLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档的代理框架，特别针对幻灯片文档。它通过三级专业化代理（全局、页面、元素）进行分解推理，构建结构化表示，在推理时选择性激活代理并整合输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂的多页面视觉文档时存在困难，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面。大型语言模型虽然提供了文档理解的机会，但需要更好的框架来处理这类复杂文档。

Method: SlideAgent采用专业化代理框架，将推理分解为三个层级：全局级、页面级和元素级。构建查询无关的结构化表示，捕捉整体主题和详细视觉/文本线索。在推理时选择性激活专业化代理进行多级推理。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9分，相比开源模型整体提升9.8分，取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架能够有效处理多页面视觉文档的理解任务，通过多级专业化代理的协同工作，在文档理解方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从规模扩展角度的严谨对比分析，可能忽视了编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用解码器LLM的最新配方进行增强，在150M到8B不同规模上与因果语言建模预训练的DecLLM进行对比。

Result: RedLLM展现出有竞争力的扩展特性和强大性能，在指令调优后在下游任务上达到相当甚至更好的结果，同时具有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器LLM具有开发强大高效LLM的潜力，值得重新审视和进一步探索。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: Evontree从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，并通过自蒸馏微调来强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先的监督基线，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs在低资源领域适应提供了有效、高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，在公平比较下首次在各种场景中超越全注意力机制，包括短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景。核心是Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)，通过更细粒度的门控机制扩展Gated DeltaNet，有效利用有限有限状态RNN内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力方法在性能上仍落后于全注意力机制，特别是在公平比较条件下。需要开发既能保持高效性又能超越全注意力性能的线性注意力架构。

Method: 提出Kimi Linear混合架构，核心是KDA模块（扩展Gated DeltaNet的细粒度门控机制），使用专门的分块算法和Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) 变体矩阵实现硬件效率。预训练3B激活参数、48B总参数的模型，结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)。

Result: 在相同训练方案下，Kimi Linear在所有评估任务中显著超越全MLA，同时减少KV缓存使用达75%，在1M上下文长度下实现6倍解码吞吐量。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的即插即用替代方案，提供更优性能和效率，包括处理更长输入输出长度的任务。开源KDA内核和vLLM实现，发布预训练和指令调优模型检查点。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一个新型架构，通过在标准Transformer上添加轻量级头部，使模型能够动态预测上下文相关的温度值和top-p值，实现真正的端到端生成，无需手动调整解码超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际依赖非可微的解码过程，需要手动调整温度、top-p等超参数，过程繁琐且不灵活。

Method: 在标准Transformer架构基础上添加轻量级头部，在每个生成步骤同时预测下一个token的logits以及上下文特定的温度和top-p值，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且性能接近通过"黑客测试集"获得的oracle调优基线，这是任何静态方法的实际上限。

Conclusion: AutoDeco实现了真正的端到端生成，并展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，模型能够理解自然语言指令并相应调整解码策略，为可引导和交互式LLM解码开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型在训练过程中如何学习人类价值观对齐，发现监督微调阶段主要确立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐价值观，不同优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会产生不同对齐结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中作用日益重要，需要研究它们如何学习与人类价值体系对齐，而现有工作主要关注已训练好的模型，忽略了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合流行的监督微调和偏好优化数据集与算法，分析训练过程中价值观漂移的幅度和时间。

Result: 监督微调阶段一般确立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观；不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会导致不同的价值观对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究为理解训练过程中价值观学习提供了可行见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择模型和偏好优化算法来改善模型与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个包含50道奥林匹克数学竞赛难度原创题目的高级数学推理基准，旨在评估顶尖大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准对顶级大语言模型的评估效果逐渐减弱，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型推理能力的提升。

Method: 创建50道经专家交叉验证达到国际数学奥林匹克竞赛难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案而非证明，实现自动评分。

Result: 在26个大语言模型上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅为52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但发现测试时计算量增加时的良好扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在数学推理方面仍有巨大改进空间，AMO-Bench的发布将促进语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify是一个代码库级别的评估任务，要求编码LLM从完整代码库中提取特定功能的必要代码，生成一个最小化的独立文件来复现相同功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中的部署增加，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级别评估方法。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成一个最小化、自包含的文件来复现相同命令的输出。

Result: 研究发现当前最先进的模型在解决Gistify任务时表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务需要代码库结构理解、执行流程建模和生成大型代码补丁的能力，现有模型在这方面仍有困难。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习水下目标检测模型中的有效性，比较了标准YOLOv5、时间增强的T-YOLOv5以及结合CBAM的T-YOLOv5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决动态海洋环境中目标检测的挑战，特别是在突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动条件下提高检测精度。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发了结合卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)的T-YOLOv5增强版本。

Result: 测试结果显示，YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂目标检测中表现出更优的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5相比标准模型显著提高了检测可靠性，而T-YOLOv5+CBAM在挑战性场景中性能更优，但在简单场景中精度有所损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中让模型学习多个奖励模型，直接学习用户偏好，而不是采用后处理选择图像的方式，从而显著提升生成图像质量并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练，虽然能实现多样化生成，但与用户偏好不一致。现有的奖励模型通过后处理选择图像来对齐奖励，但会损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型基于多个奖励模型进行条件生成，直接学习用户偏好，而不是采用后处理丢弃数据的方式。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准测试和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上实现了最先进的性能，不仅大幅提升生成图像视觉质量，还显著加速训练过程。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中直接学习用户偏好，而不是依赖后处理选择，MIRO方法在保持多样性和语义保真度的同时，实现了更好的图像质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

Motivation: 解决STM技术中针尖退化和串行数据采集缓慢的问题，提高实验通量。

Method: 使用36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练流匹配和扩散模型。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，将图像采集时间减少2-4倍，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验通量，减少针尖调节频率并增强高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

Motivation: 现有整流流模型在图像生成中表现出色，但在图像编辑任务中存在反转过程不准确和梯度纠缠问题，导致编辑结果无法忠实反映目标提示词。

Method: 采用流分解与聚合框架：语义分解目标提示词为多个子提示词，为每个子提示词计算独立流，设计投影和软聚合机制自适应加权子目标速度场。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在语义保真度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零样本编辑方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架有效解决了整流流模型在图像编辑中的局限性，实现了更好的语义一致性和编辑质量。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Method: 使用脑交互变换器(BIT)实现功能相似脑体素簇之间的有效交互，预测高层语义特征和低层结构特征来指导扩散模型

Result: 在视觉和客观指标上都超越现有方法，仅用1小时fMRI数据即可达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能簇共享机制，实现了高效且高保真的fMRI图像重建

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Motivation: 解决TrackRAD2025挑战中的实时肿瘤跟踪问题，特别是在胸腹部区域cine-MRI序列中，面临严重数据稀缺约束。

Method: 采用SAM 2.1基础模型进行分割，使用第一张标注切片作为掩码提示，仅在小规模标注数据上微调。训练采用1024x1024图像块、标准数据增强、Dice+IoU损失函数，所有模块使用0.0001的低学习率以防止过拟合。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，在TrackRAD2025挑战赛中排名第六。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中具有强大的实时肿瘤跟踪潜力，能够在数据稀缺条件下实现准确分割。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在低光图像增强中存在信息不一致和空间局部性不足的问题，需要更有效的特征空间探索机制来捕捉精细细节。

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制，增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，改善空间局部性，同时保持处理长距离依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试中显著提升了定量指标和定性视觉质量，同时减少了计算资源消耗和推理时间。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了低光图像增强的技术水平，还为基于Mamba技术的更广泛应用领域提供了前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal

potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时序注意力模块的Video-LLM架构，显著提升了视频时序理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解视频复杂时序动态方面存在严重局限，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时序进展的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时序注意力模块，通过时序注意力机制使模型在将视觉标记传递给LLM之前就能更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时序推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面超越了现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准测试中性能提升最高达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时序结构，解决了Video-LLM在视频理解中的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlexICL框架，通过上下文学习在超声图像中分割骨骼区域，仅需5%标注数据即可在肘部和腕部超声数据集上实现稳健分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和腕部骨折超声诊断中像素级专家标注耗时耗力的问题，帮助训练不足的用户更自信地进行检查。

Method: FlexICL框架采用视频内分割设置，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧；系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖拼接方法增强模型性能。

Result: 在1252个超声扫描上，Dice系数比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等先进视觉ICL模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型高出1-27%。

Conclusion: FlexICL为超声图像分割提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学影像应用场景。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的中间结果动态调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询视觉语言模型来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法比传统固定负提示更有效，能够根据生成过程自适应调整，提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PReMA攻击方法，通过修改输入图像而非提示词来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是在固定提示词场景下产生NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的文本和图像模态对齐不足，存在生成不当内容的风险，特别是在图像编辑应用中固定提示词的情况下。

Method: PReMA攻击通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，无需修改提示词本身，区别于以往主要生成对抗性提示词的方法。

Result: 在图像修复和风格迁移任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵模型生成NSFW内容。

Conclusion: PReMA对多模态扩散模型的完整性构成了新的威胁，特别是在固定提示词的图像编辑应用中。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoExo-Con基准来评估视频LLM在多视角视频中的时间理解一致性，发现现有模型存在跨视角一致性问题，并提出了View-GRPO强化学习框架来改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角视频中是否能保持时间理解的一致性，现有模型在这方面表现不佳。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我视角和外部视角视频对，并提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角一致性。

Result: 现有视频LLM在跨视角一致性方面表现较差，View-GRPO方法相比传统微调和GRPO能显著提升一致性表现。

Conclusion: 跨视角时间理解一致性是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO为改进这一能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：甲骨文释读涉及复杂的串行和并行子任务流程；甲骨文信息组织和检索效率低下，学者需花费大量时间搜索和管理相关资源。

Method: 开发OracleAgent智能体系统，集成多种甲骨文分析工具和LLMs，构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条释文的多模态知识库，通过多模态工具辅助专家进行检索任务。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLMs（如GPT-4o）；案例研究显示能有效辅助领域专家，显著降低甲骨文研究时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent是甲骨文辅助研究和自动化释读系统实际部署的重要进展，为甲骨文研究提供了有效的智能支持工具。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法严重依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会带来计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，然后使用结合几何和光度约束的自定义3D光流算法优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超过了基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合优化策略有效解决了传统方法在大视角变化和稀疏特征分布等挑战性场景中的投影误差问题。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

TL;DR: 提出了WOD-E2E数据集，专门针对自动驾驶中的长尾挑战场景，包含4021个驾驶片段，并设计了新的开环评估指标RFS来更准确地评估端到端驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统潜力；现有开环评估指标难以捕捉驾驶的多模态特性，也无法有效评估长尾场景性能。

Method: 构建了WOD-E2E数据集，专门收集发生频率低于0.03%的挑战性长尾场景；提出了Rater Feedback Score (RFS)评估指标，基于人工标注的轨迹偏好标签来评估预测轨迹质量。

Result: 发布了包含4021个驾驶片段（约12小时）的数据集，专门针对罕见的长尾场景；提供了验证集的所有标注者偏好标签，测试集标签用于2025年WOD-E2E挑战赛。

Conclusion: 通过WOD-E2E数据集和RFS评估指标，旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的真实世界场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

TL;DR: 提出将基于梯度的网络注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，用于改进RGB-D室内SLAM中的帧关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能通过梯度识别网络在图像识别任务中的注意力区域，但将这些注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的研究仍然有限。这种集成对于需要空间注意力对象位置的视觉任务（如SLAM）特别有益。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将基于网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相结合，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 将梯度注意力信息集成到CNN表示中能够有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，特别是在复杂大环境中的帧关联任务。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Result: 在PartVerse-XL数据集上实现最先进的3D部件生成效果，能够合成复杂细节。

Conclusion: FullPart框架有效结合了隐式和显式方法的优势，显著提升了3D部件生成的细节质量和全局一致性。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Motivation: 在南亚国家，人力车是常见的交通工具，但自动人力车（机动化）和非自动人力车（脚踏式）外观相似，现有监控系统难以区分。自动人力车在某些路段受限，需要有效监控手段，而人工视频分析效率低下。

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw

TL;DR: 提出了CRAG-MM基准测试，包含6.5K图像-问题-答案三元组和2K多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，专门针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态检索增强生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补可穿戴设备场景下多模态检索增强生成任务缺乏全面基准测试的空白，支持智能眼镜等设备的信息查询需求。

Method: 构建包含6.2K第一人称视角图像的多样化数据集，设计五种图像质量问题、六种问题类型、不同实体流行度和信息动态性，提供图像-KG检索和网页检索API。

Result: 现有RAG方法在单轮和多轮问答中的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，行业最优解决方案质量相似（32%/45%），表明改进空间很大。KDD Cup 2025获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准测试揭示了当前多模态RAG方法的局限性，为可穿戴设备场景下的信息检索研究提供了重要评估平台，已产生实际影响。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架MoTDiff，从单张运动模糊图像中估计高质量的运动轨迹，在图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度和不准确，需要开发高质量的运动轨迹估计方法。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）新的条件扩散框架，使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件；2）新的训练方法，促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径的整体形状和位置，以及沿运动轨迹的像素连通性。

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中能够超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoTDiff是首个基于扩散模型的高分辨率运动轨迹估计框架，能够从单张运动模糊图像中估计出高质量的运动轨迹，在多个应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个可扩展的自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中提取人类可解释的概念，用于发现和量化数据集中的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据点偏向某些概念的数据集偏差问题，但系统性地识别这些偏差需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器在视觉基础模型表示上训练，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏差类型，基于语义相关性和统计相关性进行类别级数据集分析。

Result: 验证了ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，生成与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠检测已知偏差并发现未标注的新偏差。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了实用工具，能够自动化识别数据集偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于"从合成中学习"策略的3D人体姿态估计方法，通过扩散模型生成草图-3D姿态配对的合成数据集SKEP-120K，并构建端到端框架实现从多样化草图风格中估计人体姿态和形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统草图到姿态方法因缺乏大规模草图-3D姿态标注数据而依赖耗时优化和启发式规则的问题，提高估计的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 训练扩散模型从2D姿态合成草图图像，创建SKEP-120K合成数据集；2) 结合现有2D姿态检测器和生成扩散先验进行草图特征提取；3) 使用前馈神经网络进行高效2D姿态估计；4) 引入多种启发式损失函数保证几何一致性和自接触精度。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，该方法在草图到姿态任务中的估计准确性和速度均显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据驱动的框架成功解决了草图到3D人体姿态估计的挑战，为计算机动画和电影制作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Motivation: 供应链可持续性对优化供应链绩效至关重要，风险管理是提升网络可持续性和效率的基础问题，产品正确分类也是可持续供应链的关键要素。

Method: 使用新颖的几何深度网络提出集成深度网络Ch-EGN，这是一种混合卷积和几何深度学习的方法，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在DataCo数据集上获得98.95%的平均准确率用于风险管理；在SupplyGraph数据集上，5产品组分类获得100%准确率，4产品关系分类获得98.07%准确率，25公司关系分类获得92.37%准确率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，验证了其在供应链风险管理和可持续性方面的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M，首个百万级多样化文档布局数据集，以及OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用粗到细两阶段学习范式，在多个领域实现了优越的布局生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局生成领域研究不足，现有数据集主要集中于学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，缺乏报纸、杂志等开放世界文档类型的多样化布局数据。

Method: 构建OmniLayout-1M数据集，覆盖六种常见文档类型；提出OmniLayout-LLM模型，采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：先在OmniLayout-1M上学习通用布局原则，再迁移到特定领域进行细粒度学习。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有布局生成专家模型和多个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型有效解决了文档布局生成中的数据稀缺和复杂布局安排问题，为文档AI领域提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在判断视频时间方向性方面的能力，发现现有模型在时间推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解能力较弱且缺乏充分评估，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 通过判断视频片段是正向播放还是反向播放的简单挑战，使用经过心理物理学验证的基准测试，比较模型与人类在时间方向判断上的表现差异。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机猜测，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作上，最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统存在根本性差距：虽然能捕捉丰富的视觉语义关联，但缺乏时间连续性和因果理解所需的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法在模态信息平衡方面存在困境，生成式融合方法的数据分布学习能力有限，且模态信息选择缺乏可解释性，影响复杂场景下的融合可靠性。

Method: 1. 多尺度掩码调控变分瓶颈编码器：通过后验概率建模和信息分解提取准确简洁的低层模态信息；2. 时变物理引导机制：结合扩散模型的概率生成能力和物理规律，自适应调控生成过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升语义分割指标，证明该方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面的优势。

Conclusion: 基于人类认知启发的生成式图像融合方法能够有效提升融合图像的结构一致性和细节质量，为复杂场景下的可靠融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Method: 在VGGFace2的大规模眼部图像数据集上训练三种CNN架构，使用余弦和chi2距离度量，应用逻辑回归进行分数级融合，并使用LIME热图和Jensen-Shannon散度分析注意力模式。

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合带来显著性能提升，热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，验证了它们的互补性。

Conclusion: 通过融合不同复杂度的CNN架构，在UBIPr数据库上实现了新的最佳性能，证明了模型互补性在虹膜验证中的重要性。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样化的轨迹假设；而现有生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全和物理约束，需要额外的优化阶段来精炼输出。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，在流匹配过程中显式施加约束，确保生成的轨迹遵守安全和运动学规则；同时将驾驶激进性参数化为控制信号，实现轨迹风格的精确控制。

Conclusion: CATG框架成功解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束集成问题，通过约束流匹配实现了安全、多样化且可控的轨迹生成。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分度和最小采集约束的优势，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集（仅几千张图像），本文旨在利用大规模数据集评估CNN架构在眼周识别中的表现。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在VGGFace2数据库提取的1,907,572张眼部图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular两个数据集上进行实验评估。

Result: 在非受控条件下的VGGFace2数据集上，眼部图像的等错误率为9-15%，明显高于全脸图像的3-6%；而在UFPR-Periocular数据集上，由于图像质量更高和采集协议更一致，等错误率显著改善至1-2%。

Conclusion: 大规模训练数据显著提升了眼周识别的性能，在高质量、一致性采集的数据集上可以达到1-2%的等错误率，这是目前UFPR数据集上报告的最佳结果，证明了大规模训练数据对眼周生物识别的重要性。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于证据理论的新型融合范式，有效整合CNN和ViT骨干网络的特征，用于糖尿病视网膜病变分级诊断，提高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致中老年人视力丧失的主要原因，现有基于单一CNN或ViT骨干网络的方法性能已达瓶颈，需要融合不同骨干网络的优势来进一步提升性能。

Method: 基于证据理论提出融合范式，通过深度证据网络将不同骨干网络的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见来自适应调整融合模式。

Result: 在两个公开DR分级数据集上的实验表明，该混合模型不仅提高了DR分级的准确性，还提供了优秀的特征融合和决策可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功融合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力，突破了单一骨干网络的性能瓶颈，为DR诊断提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [96] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率问题，同时优化文本可读性和感知质量，在OCR准确率和视觉质量指标上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要关注失真度或感知质量指标，但对字符级错误不敏感。场景文本（如标志、产品标签等）通常包含最关键的信息，当字符模糊或产生幻觉时，即使图像其他部分清晰，OCR和后续决策也会失败。

Method: GLYPH-SR采用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，以及乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心引导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率任务中，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1提高了高达15.18个百分点（SVT x8，OpenOCR），同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又读起来正确的超分辨率结果，满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双条件框架，结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图来增强图像生成，解决了现有方法忽视空间注意力机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动的图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了重建图像的保真度和语义一致性。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过低秩适应(LoRA)微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，同时使用ControlNet分支基于显著性图进行空间控制。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，该方法在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验能够解决EEG的模糊性，实现高保真重建，在医学诊断和神经自适应接口中具有应用价值，通过高效适应预训练扩散模型推进了神经解码技术。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准测试，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含多维度评估框架和新指标如事件级对齐、时间一致性、内容清晰度和HERD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要依赖简化提示并关注低级指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建复杂提示，包含场景转换和事件动态元素，并建立多维度评估框架和新指标。

Result: 对9个代表性LVG模型进行评估，发现当前方法在基础视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了A-TPT框架，通过引入角度多样性来改善视觉语言模型在测试时提示调优中的校准性能，通过最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现特征均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法缺乏文本特征间的分散性，导致校准性能不佳，影响模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。这些方法主要关注最大化平均文本特征分散性或施加正交约束，但可能无法实现最优的角度分离。

Method: 提出A-TPT框架，引入角度多样性概念，通过在单位超球面上最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离，鼓励学习提示诱导的文本特征分布均匀性。

Result: 在各种骨干网络和数据集上的广泛实验表明，A-TPT在降低聚合平均校准误差方面持续优于最先进的TPT方法，同时保持相当的准确性。在自然分布偏移和医学数据集上表现出优越的零样本校准性能。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适应于点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪方面取得竞争性或更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到点跟踪任务，特别是在动态场景中实现更好的性能。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅在包含查询点的帧对上进行训练和评估，移除了时间上下文。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS上73.8 δ_avg/85.8%遮挡准确率（CoTracker2为75.7/88.3%）；EgoPoints上61.3 vs 54.2；RGB-S上87.0 vs 82.8，显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: PointSt3R方法成功将3D重建模型适应于点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点对应方面都表现出色，证明了3D基础对应在点跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 本文提出FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述解决小样本异常检测中语义对齐不足的问题，提升异常定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练视觉语言模型，但缺乏细粒度文本描述，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义错位，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建流程，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件，通过自动替换、区域聚合和多级对齐训练改善语义对齐。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的小样本设置中实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD框架通过多级细粒度语义描述有效解决了语义对齐问题，显著提升了小样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于因果推理的方法来解决视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文捷径问题，通过合成反事实嵌入来消除背景偏差，提升零样本可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时，存在对象-上下文捷径问题，导致零样本可靠性下降。本文将其重新定义为因果推理问题。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过将对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的不同上下文重新组合来合成反事实嵌入。使用总直接效应估计和干预模拟来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，该方法在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为消除偏差和实现可靠的多模态推理提供了一条实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 当前自我改进范式存在关键问题：模型擅长为简单查询生成高质量轨迹，但在复杂查询上表现不佳，导致优化不平衡，阻碍模型处理复杂推理任务的能力。

Method: 提出了四种高效策略，从两个角度入手：分布重塑和轨迹重采样，在探索-学习自我改进过程中实现头尾数据重新平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法在视觉推理任务上持续提升能力，平均比原始自我改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过解决自我改进过程中的头尾不平衡问题，提出的方法有效提升了大型视觉语言模型的推理能力，突破了性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视频摘要技术的自动视频广告剪辑框架，将视频剪辑定义为针对广告优化的镜头选择问题，特别强调音频在广告中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统广告制作需要为同一广告活动手动制作不同时长的版本，这个过程劳动密集且耗时。现有的通用视频摘要方法主要关注视觉内容，而忽略了音频在广告中的重要性。

Method: 开发了一个双流音视频融合模型来预测视频帧的重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入公司制作的短广告的可能性。为解决缺乏广告特定数据集的问题，创建了AdSum204数据集，包含102对真实广告活动中的30秒和15秒广告。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将视频剪辑作为专门针对广告的镜头选择问题，证明了音频在广告剪辑中的重要性，并提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级域分类器和双适配器机制，在不重新训练主干模型的情况下提升VQA模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗、数学图表等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降，现有方法依赖按域微调或定制化流程，成本高且不灵活。

Method: 引入两个轻量级模块：域分类器识别输入图像类型，双适配器机制包括用于语言调制的提示适配器和用于视觉特征调整的视觉适配器，通过统一钩子接口动态注入。

Result: 在四个域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA +2.3 BLEU，MedVQA-RAD +2.6 VQA，ChartQA +3.1 ROUGE，无需重新训练主干模型。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，能够在不同应用领域中实现实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够原生预测视觉和语言下一状态的多模态世界模型，实现长序列视觉语言生成、任意到图像生成等复杂能力。

Method: 采用端到端预训练，使用统一的下一标记预测目标；提出离散扩散适应(DiDA)技术将逐标记解码转换为双向并行预测，提升推理效率；通过大规模强化学习增强多模态推理和生成能力。

Result: Emu3.5在图像生成和编辑任务上达到与Gemini 2.5 Flash Image相当的性能，在交织生成任务上表现更优；推理速度提升约20倍；具备时空一致的世界探索和开放世界具身操作能力。

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，包括长序列视觉语言生成、任意到图像生成和复杂文本丰富图像生成，为社区研究提供了开源模型。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种新的计算超分辨率方法，使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验，在生物结构图像上表现出色，特别是在噪声多的低分辨率图像中，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光显微镜中的计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，核心在于找到能够外推显微镜未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动的机器学习技术发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: ResMatching使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法比较，ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳权衡，特别是在噪声多的低分辨率图像中表现优异。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中表现出色，特别是在先验难以学习的情况下，能够提供校准的后验分布和有用的不确定性指导，帮助用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了Spiking Patches事件标记化方法，为事件相机设计的新型标记器，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但破坏了事件的异步性和空间稀疏性特征。需要一种能保持事件相机独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 提出Spiking Patches标记器，将异步稀疏事件流转换为标记表示，在保持事件原始特性的同时实现高效处理。

Result: 在姿态识别和物体检测任务中，Spiking Patches标记比体素标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧标记快10.4倍，精度相当甚至更好（姿态识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 事件标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是向保持事件相机特性方法迈进的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the

model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模评估了48种深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的性能，多个模型实现了亚公里级精度，证明了深度学习光流方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计海冰漂移对北极航行、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。传统光流方法依赖数学模型和强运动假设，在复杂场景中精度有限，而深度学习光流方法在计算机视觉中表现出色，但其在地球物理问题和卫星SAR图像中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用48种深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过端点误差(EPE)和Fl指标与GNSS跟踪浮标进行对比评估。

Result: 多个模型实现了亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），相对于海冰运动的空间尺度和北极典型导航需求来说误差较小。模型能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法相比传统方法显著提高了运动估计精度，可有效转移到极地遥感应用。光流产生空间连续的漂移场，为每个图像像素提供运动估计，为导航和气候建模提供了新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级的引导模块，通过动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接，实现对视觉语言模型输出的细粒度控制，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循复杂指令方面存在不足，需要一种轻量级方法来引导模型输出更好地符合期望指令，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应引导来动态调整激活连接，仅需学习原模型0.14%的参数。

Result: 在引导和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，提出了通过激活工程实现多模态模型控制的稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: SteerVLM提供了一种高效的推理时控制方法，能够在不修改模型权重的情况下实现复杂的输出语义控制，并引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM引导技术的发展。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适用于广泛运动中心任务的数据驱动分层建模范式。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成领域向运动生成领域迁移知识，能够有效提升3D人体运动生成的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像精确定位的挑战，现有方法要么效率低下，要么精度粗糙，无法在覆盖不足时有效工作。

Method: 使用代理分类任务学习隐含编码精确位置信息的特征表示，结合航空影像嵌入增强对稀疏地面数据的鲁棒性，实现直接细粒度检索。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%以上的查询能够在200米范围内实现定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，解决了现有方法的局限性，代码已公开。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件修复模型，实现了从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽无需姿态标签，但轨迹到轨迹的表述将相机运动与场景动态混在一起，使建模和推理复杂化。

Method: 提出轨迹到相机框架，用固定虚拟相机库替代显式轨迹预测，分离相机控制与场景建模。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推理管道在虚拟相机样条上生成连贯内容。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹条件的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D推进了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的能力，无需显式3D标注即可生成高质量的时空内容。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征。在训练中随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，然后基于视觉特征训练解码器重建原始文本。该方法不依赖标记在序列中的位置，减少了辅助目标的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，这限制了特征学习效果。MDC旨在通过扩散模型提供更均匀的视觉学习信号，减少对辅助目标的依赖。

Method: 使用图像条件掩码扩散语言模型，在训练过程中随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，然后训练基于视觉特征的解码器来重建原始文本。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，MDC学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC提供了一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，通过扩散模型实现了与现有方法相媲美的性能，同时减少了对外部辅助目标的依赖。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Conclusion: OmniX框架成功将2D生成先验重新用于全景感知任务，实现了图形就绪3D场景的生成，推动了沉浸式虚拟环境的发展。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Result: 视频模型在短时空间一致性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型还不能作为独立的零样本推理器，但可以作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎，展现出令人鼓舞的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，通过拒绝采样方法从仅标签注释中推断思维轨迹，用于微调开放LLM评分器和改进专有LLM评分器的标注指南，显著提高LLM与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估任务评分器时，对于主观任务的可靠性有限，因为人类判断涉及超越标注标签的微妙推理。思维轨迹（判断背后的推理）信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用简单有效的拒绝采样方法重构思维轨迹，将推断的思维轨迹应用于两个互补任务：微调开放LLM评分器和为专有LLM评分器合成更清晰的标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法显著提高了LLM与人类判断的一致性，改进后的标注指南还增加了不同LLM模型之间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为未揭示的人类思维轨迹的实际代理，使仅标签语料库能够扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评分器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Conclusion: 该框架为解决LLM法官校准问题提供了有效方法，能够更好地对齐人类偏好，提升奖励模型和路由系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Motivation: 当前强化学习主要关注数学和编程领域，但需要将推理能力扩展到更广泛的领域。

Method: 两阶段课程学习：1）在数学领域进行强化学习，使用可验证奖励培养推理技能；2）在多领域数据上进行联合强化学习，迁移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B模型上，该方法在跨领域基准测试中取得一致性能提升，消融实验表明两个阶段都必不可少。

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理能力提升方案，数学优先的推理激发策略能增强解决复杂问题所需的关键认知行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅适用于训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，包括Best-of-N采样和自校正，为工具学习领域的奖励建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Method: 引入了一个新数据集，涵盖规范和认知领域的广泛推理模式，通过比较LLMs在规范性模态和认知模态中的推理表现来评估其能力。

Result: 结果显示LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定规范性推理类型中存在显著不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs规范性推理中实现逻辑一致性的挑战，为提升其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

TL;DR: 提出异步思维(AsyncThink)新范式，通过组织者动态分配子任务给工作者并行执行，降低推理延迟28%并提升数学推理准确率，且能泛化到未见任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现智能体组织新范式，让多个智能体通过协作并发解决复杂问题，超越个体智能的局限。

Method: 引入异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识生成连贯解决方案，并通过强化学习优化思维结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，提升数学推理准确率，且无需额外训练即可有效处理未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是实现智能体组织协作的有效范式，能显著提升推理效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

*J. de Curtò,I. de Zarzà,Pablo García,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个跨平台的基础模型推理能力评估框架，在三种计算范式（HPC超级计算、云平台、大学集群）上评估了15个基础模型在8个学术领域的79个问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立基础设施无关的基准测试，系统评估当代基础模型在不同计算环境下的推理能力，挑战传统的规模扩展假设。

Method: 采用三阶段实验设计：1）基线建立（6个模型在19个问题上）；2）基础设施验证（在不同平台上重复基准测试）；3）扩展评估（在79个问题上全面评估）。

Result: 发现训练数据质量比模型规模更重要，挑战了传统的规模扩展假设，并为不同应用场景提供了模型选择指南。

Conclusion: 提出的三基础设施方法和79问题基准能够纵向跟踪基础模型推理能力的发展，为模型选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

*Soufiane Essahli,Oussama Sarsar,Imane Fouad,Anas Motii,Ahmed Bentajer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero是一个完全客户端、跨平台的浏览器扩展，能够在用户滚动时实时标记Facebook和X平台上的不可靠帖子，所有计算都在本地进行，保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体以空前速度传播信息，同时也加速了错误信息的传播，威胁公共讨论。需要一种能够实时检测虚假信息且保护用户隐私的解决方案。

Method: 采用三阶段训练课程：基线微调、领域自适应训练（包含焦点损失、对抗增强和后训练量化）。使用DistilBERT-Quant和TinyBERT-Quant模型，所有计算通过Chromium消息API在本地运行。

Result: 在239,000条帖子的数据集上，DistilBERT-Quant模型（67.6 MB）达到97.1%宏F1、97.4%准确率和0.996 AUROC，中位延迟约103毫秒。TinyBERT-Quant变体（14.7 MB）保持95.7%宏F1和96.1%准确率，延迟降至约40毫秒。

Conclusion: FakeZero证明了在严格资源预算下实现高质量虚假新闻检测的可行性，为政策制定者提供遏制错误信息传播的有价值工具，并为研究人员收集大规模虚假新闻数据集开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

*Kaiwen Zhou,Ahmed Elgohary,A S M Iftekhar,Amin Saied*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIRAJ是一个通用的红队测试框架，用于发现黑盒LLM代理的安全漏洞。它采用动态两步流程生成多样化的测试用例，并通过模型蒸馏优化成本，使8B模型在攻击成功率上超越671B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理规划和使用工具的能力带来了新的安全风险，需要全面的红队测试系统来发现漏洞并确保安全部署。

Method: 采用动态两步流程：首先生成覆盖各种风险结果、工具使用轨迹和风险源的多样化种子测试用例；然后基于先前执行轨迹迭代构建和优化基于模型的对抗攻击。通过结构化推理的模型蒸馏方法训练更小的模型。

Result: 种子测试用例生成方法使风险结果和工具调用轨迹的覆盖率提高了2-2.5倍。蒸馏后的8B红队模型攻击成功率提升100%，超越了671B的Deepseek-R1模型。

Conclusion: 该框架验证了迭代框架、结构化推理和红队模型泛化能力的有效性，为LLM代理的安全部署提供了可靠的红队测试解决方案。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark是一个基于零知识证明的插件，使LLM水印检测过程能够被第三方公开验证，同时不泄露任何密钥，解决了现有水印方案无法公开验证的信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM水印方案存在信任问题：非公开的水印检测无法证明自己忠实地执行了检测。这源于密钥的困境——公开密钥会导致攻击者发起移除攻击，私有密钥又使水印检测对公众不透明。

Method: 基于零知识证明构建水印检测的'正确执行'证明，包括映射、随机数生成、比较和求和等约束条件。实现了多种PVMark变体，覆盖三种水印方案、三种哈希函数和四种ZKP协议。

Result: 实验结果表明，PVMark能够在不影响水印性能的前提下，高效地为最先进的LLM水印方案提供公开可验证性，有望在实际中部署。

Conclusion: PVMark通过零知识证明技术成功解决了LLM水印检测的公开验证问题，为水印方案的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DARTS是一个基于无人机和AI的实时交通事故检测系统，通过整合无人机的高机动性、热成像技术和轻量级深度学习框架，实现了99%的检测准确率，比传统方法提前12分钟检测到事故。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通事故检测方法存在检测与验证分离、灵活性有限、需要密集基础设施等问题，限制了适应性和可扩展性。

Method: DARTS整合了无人机的高机动性和空中视角进行自适应监控，使用热成像技术提升低能见度性能和隐私保护，采用轻量级深度学习框架进行实时车辆轨迹提取和事故检测。

Result: 在自收集数据集上达到99%检测准确率，在佛罗里达州75号州际公路实地测试中，比当地交通管理中心提前12分钟检测到追尾事故，并能监控事故引发的拥堵传播。

Conclusion: DARTS展示了更灵活、集成的实时交通事故检测系统的潜力，对现代交通管理的运营效率和响应能力具有重要影响，特别是在偏远地区和资源受限环境中具有可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出结合CNN和Vision Transformer的新方法，用于在动态障碍物存在时实现基于单目相机的3D地图自定位，相比现有方法精度显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用廉价单目相机在3D地图上实现自定位对自动驾驶很重要。基于相机的自定位通常使用CNN提取局部特征，但当存在动态障碍物（如行人）时，CNN效果不佳。

Method: 将擅长提取局部特征的CNN与擅长提取全局特征的Vision Transformer相结合，Vision Transformer能够提取整个图像上patch之间的关系。

Result: 在包含动态障碍物的CG数据集上，精度提升率比无动态障碍物时高1.5倍；在公共数据集上自定位误差比现有最佳方法小20.1%；机器人平均自定位误差为7.51cm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CNN与Vision Transformer结合方法在动态障碍物环境下显著提升了自定位精度，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的定位方案。

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM是一个结合视觉-LiDAR的SLAM框架，在果园环境中实现实时3D场景理解，通过多相机3D高斯泼溅渲染和LiDAR里程计耦合，在季节变化和遮挡条件下提供稳定的重建和轨迹估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决果园环境中自主机器人面临的挑战：重复的行几何结构、季节性外观变化和风驱动叶片运动，需要实时3D场景理解能力。

Method: 结合直接LiDAR里程计和闭环检测与多相机3D高斯泼溅渲染，使用批量栅格化恢复遮挡下的果园结构，通过统一梯度驱动的地图生命周期管理保持细节并限制内存使用。

Result: 在苹果和梨园跨休眠、开花和收获季节的测试中，相比现有3DGS-SLAM基线方法，提供更清晰稳定的重建和更平稳的轨迹，同时保持拖拉机上的实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在果园监测中表现优异，也可应用于其他需要鲁棒多模态感知的户外领域。

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

TL;DR: 提出了SP-MCQA评估方法，通过口语段落多选题问答来评估合成语音中关键信息的准确性，发现低WER并不保证高关键信息准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS可懂度评估过度依赖词级准确率指标如WER，无法捕捉真实语音的复杂性或反映人类理解需求。

Method: 提出Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering主观评估方法，并发布8.76小时新闻风格基准数据集SP-MCQA-Eval。

Result: 实验显示低WER不一定保证高关键信息准确率，暴露传统指标与实际可懂度之间的差距。即使SOTA模型在文本归一化和语音准确性方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前许多系统在WER上表现出色但在真实世界可懂度上可能不足，迫切需要更高级、更贴近生活的评估标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Nexus是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于生成非回归测试中的测试预言，通过专门化智能体的协作审议、验证和迭代自优化过程，显著提升了测试预言的准确性和下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决软件工程中长期存在的非回归测试中测试预言生成的挑战，目标是生成能够准确判断被测函数是否按预期行为的测试预言。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含四个体现不同测试理念的专门化智能体进行协作审议，生成候选FUT实现并在安全沙箱中执行验证，对失败的预言启动自动化自优化循环进行调试和修正。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试上，Nexus持续且显著优于现有最先进基线方法。例如，在LiveCodeBench上将GPT-4.1-Mini的测试级预言准确率从46.30%提升至57.73%，在HumanEval上错误检测率从90.91%提升至95.45%，自动程序修复成功率从35.23%提升至69.32%。

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过多智能体协作和迭代自优化机制，有效解决了测试预言生成问题，显著提升了测试准确性和下游任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法主要关注通用目的审查，在识别和解决安全相关问题方面效果不足，且面临数据稀缺和评估指标不完善等挑战。

Method: 1) 构建安全代码审查专用数据集；2) 采用安全感知微调策略训练LLM；3) 集成RAG技术减少幻觉；4) 提出SecureBLEU评估指标。

Conclusion: SecureReviewer通过专门的数据集、微调策略和评估指标，有效提升了LLM在安全代码审查中的性能，为软件安全开发提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑技术通常只编辑单一模态(视觉或语言)，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的持续性，导致编辑效果不佳。

Method: 使用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部内存用于跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器实现各模态解耦参数更新，以及脑启发知识连接器进行组合推理。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，有效保留先前编辑，为LVLMs的CCKE设定了新基准。

Conclusion: MemEIC通过组合编辑方法解决了多模态知识编辑的挑战，为持续知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs

*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练方法（而非SFT）进行冷启动，将多模态学习解耦为浅层格式学习和深层推理学习，在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织在一起，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并最终影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1）通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2）进行偏好训练，专注于学习可转移的表面形式标准；3）将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提高4.1%，MathVista提高12.2%，同时减少分布内"卡顿"、改善探索、稳定训练并提高性能上限。

Conclusion: 偏好训练方法在冷启动中比SFT方法具有更好的泛化能力，解耦学习框架能够有效提升多模态模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Motivation: 研究知识蒸馏对模型去偏能力迁移的影响，探索KD如何影响模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性

Method: 在自然语言推理和图像分类任务上进行广泛实验，分析注意力模式和内部机制，提出三种改进方案

Result: 发现KD会削弱去偏能力，不同偏见的鲁棒性变化显著，识别了导致这种行为的内部注意力模式和电路

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模研究KD对去偏影响及其内部机制的工作，为设计更好的去偏方法提供了理解

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Motivation: 在工业物流仓库中，摄像头可用于定位工人并获取环境上下文信息，但仅凭视觉数据难以识别个体。现有方法通过比较轨迹和可穿戴传感器测量来识别人员，但在真实条件下可能失效。

Method: 1. 深度学习模型预测每个轨迹与传感器测量对的对应概率和可靠性；2. 算法基于预测的概率和可靠性随时间匹配轨迹和传感器测量。

Result: 开发了包含实际仓库操作的数据集，证明了该方法在真实场景应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法能够有效解决工业环境中基于视觉和传感器数据的人员识别问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了序列建模中参数化记忆作为实体共现关联查找的传统观点，提出了几何视角，认为Transformer模型通过谱偏差自然形成了原子事实的几何结构，简化了复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将参数化记忆抽象为实体共现的暴力查找，作者认为这种关联视图忽略了记忆的几何结构特性，需要探索模型如何自然形成全局实体关系的几何表示。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理实例，对比关联视图与几何视图；建立与Node2Vec的联系，揭示谱偏差在几何结构形成中的作用；证明即使没有优化压力，优雅的几何结构也会自然产生。

Result: 发现Transformer模型能够合成原子事实的几何结构，编码所有实体间的全局关系，将复杂的ℓ重组合推理任务简化为易于学习的1步几何任务；几何结构比暴力查找关联更简洁。

Conclusion: 参数化记忆的几何视角应该重新指导研究者在知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的研究直觉；实践者还有提升Transformer记忆几何强度的空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 虽然AI在研究型基准测试中表现出色，但其经济价值和实际自动化能力尚不清楚。需要建立一个能够衡量AI在实际工作场景中表现的基准。

Method: 引入远程劳动指数(RLI)，这是一个多行业基准，包含真实世界、具有经济价值的项目，用于评估AI代理在实践环境中的端到端性能。

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文发现RL微调LLM时的不稳定性源于BF16精度引入的舍入误差，导致训练与推理策略不一致。简单改用FP16即可解决此问题，无需修改模型或算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL微调方法常因训练与推理策略的数值不匹配导致不稳定，先前工作通过算法修正或工程对齐尝试缓解，但根本原因在于浮点精度本身。

Method: 将广泛采用的BF16精度改为FP16精度，这一改变简单易行，现代框架完全支持，只需几行代码修改，无需改动模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 统一使用FP16能带来更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，在多样化任务、算法和框架上都表现出更强的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑RL微调中的精度权衡，FP16是更优选择。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量不足——高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。本文旨在通过改进表示学习来构建真正准确的世界模型。

Method: 提出GRWM方法，在潜在表示空间中实施几何正则化，强制连续观测点保持接近性。该方法即插即用，只需最小架构修改，可扩展且兼容多种潜在生成骨干网络。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长期预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了推演保真度和稳定性。分析表明其优势源于学习到具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效路径，可在不扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired
from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model).
The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific

various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with
various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal
registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

Motivation: 橄榄树生物体积估算是精准农业的关键任务，支持产量预测和资源管理，特别是在受气候变化影响严重的地中海地区。

Method: 使用手动标注的树冠和阴影掩膜，通过空间特征提取和稳健分割，结合树冠投影面积和基于阴影的高度（利用太阳几何学）估算单株生物体积。

Result: Mask R-CNN获得最佳整体精度（F1 = 0.86；mIoU = 0.72），YOLOv11m-seg提供最快处理速度（每图0.12秒），估算的生物体积范围为4-24立方米。

Conclusion: Mask R-CNN在生物体积精度要求高时更优，YOLOv11m-seg适合速度关键的大面积部署，U-Net是轻量级高灵敏度选项。该框架可实现准确、可扩展的果园监测。

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
artifact severity classification. The code is available at

Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and
interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Result: 实验表明：(1) 全面数据集有助于提升模型泛化能力；(2) 基于优化的方法对未见解剖结构具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MORE数据集为CT重建模型的鲁棒训练和泛化评估提供了重要资源，基于优化的方法在跨解剖结构泛化方面表现更优。

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies
with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust
training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our
project page https://more-med.github.io/

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出StructLayoutFormer，一种基于Transformer的条件结构化布局生成方法，能够生成具有明确布局结构的2D视觉内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法能自动生成固定布局但无法产生布局结构，而结构化布局在GUI、网页等2D视觉内容中具有重要编辑优势。

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，并将结构信息与元素位置解耦，通过Transformer架构实现条件结构化布局生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法在条件结构化布局生成方面优于现有基线方法，并能有效提取和传输布局结构。

Conclusion: 这是首个实现条件结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能够生成具有现实布局结构的明确布局。

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is
publicly available at %\href{https://github.com/Teagrus/StructLayoutFormer}

TL;DR: DySQL-Bench是一个用于评估Text-to-SQL模型在动态多轮交互场景下性能的新基准，通过自动化流水线生成任务，模拟真实用户意图演变过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Text-to-SQL系统在静态单轮任务中表现良好，但在真实交互场景中用户意图会随时间演变，需要模型能够适应查询约束和维度的多次调整。

Method: 采用两阶段自动化流水线：基于数据库表结构树表示的任务合成，以及交互导向的过滤和专家验证。同时提出多轮评估框架，模拟LLM用户、被测模型和可执行数据库之间的交互。

Result: 构建了包含13个领域、1072个任务的基准，人工验证确认合成数据100%正确。GPT-4o在该基准上仅达到58.34%整体准确率和23.81%的Pass@5指标。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench揭示了当前Text-to-SQL模型在动态交互场景中的显著不足，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

Conclusion: ORBIT基准测试揭示了现有推荐方法的局限性，特别是在大规模网页推荐场景中，并展示了LLM集成的改进潜力。该平台为推荐系统研究提供了更真实和一致的评估环境。

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT
benchmark, leaderboard, and codebase are available at
https://www.open-reco-bench.ai.
