### [1] [Advancing Mental Disorder Detection: A Comparative Evaluation of Transformer and LSTM Architectures on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19511)
*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer,Mukulika Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了多种Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa等）与LSTM模型在心理健康分类任务中的表现，发现Transformer模型表现更优，尤其是RoBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题的增加需要自动化工具进行早期检测和监控，NLP技术的进步为此提供了可能。

Method: 构建大型标注数据集，比较Transformer模型（BERT、RoBERTa等）与LSTM模型的表现，并通过统计分析和主题建模验证数据可靠性。

Result: RoBERTa表现最佳，测试集F1分数达99.54%，外部测试集为96.05%。LSTM结合BERT嵌入也有竞争力，F1分数超过94%。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在实时、可扩展的心理健康监测中效果显著，为临床应用和数字干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

### [2] [Setting The Table with Intent: Intent-aware Schema Generation and Editing for Literature Review Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19521)
*Vishakh Padmakumar,Joseph Chee Chang,Kyle Lo,Doug Downey,Aakanksha Naik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用LLMs生成文档比较框架的方法，解决了现有评估模糊和缺乏编辑技术的问题，并通过数据集和编辑技术提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术文献数量激增，需要有效组织与比较文档，但现有方法在评估和编辑方面存在不足。

Method: 通过合成意图增强无标注表格数据，创建数据集；提出多种LLM框架编辑技术，并对比单次生成方法。

Result: 结合意图显著提升基准性能；小规模开放权重模型通过微调可与先进提示LLMs竞争；编辑技术进一步优化生成框架。

Conclusion: 论文为文档比较框架生成提供了新方法，解决了评估和编辑问题，并展示了性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

### [3] [Mind the Language Gap in Digital Humanities: LLM-Aided Translation of SKOS Thesauri](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19537)
*Felix Kraus,Nicolas Blumenröhr,Danah Tonne,Achim Streit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WOKIE是一个开源、模块化的自动化SKOS词表翻译工具，结合外部翻译服务和LLM优化，提升翻译质量和语义互操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字人文学科中语言多样性导致的资源访问和语义互操作性限制。

Method: 结合外部翻译服务和LLM进行针对性优化，支持多语言翻译和本体匹配改进。

Result: 在15种语言的词表测试中，WOKIE显著提升了翻译质量、性能和本体匹配效果。

Conclusion: WOKIE通过无障碍自动化翻译和本体匹配改进，支持更包容和多语言的研究基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

### [4] [Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19586)
*Shengyuan Wang,Jie Feng,Tianhui Liu,Dan Pei,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估和减轻大语言模型（LLM）地理空间幻觉的框架，通过知识图谱和动态事实对齐方法（KTO）显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在地理空间任务中表现出不准确的知识（地理空间幻觉），影响其可靠性，而现有研究对此缺乏系统性评估和解决方法。

Method: 提出基于结构化地理空间知识图谱的评估框架，并通过Kahneman-Tversky优化（KTO）方法动态对齐事实以减少幻觉。

Result: 在20个先进LLM上的评估揭示了地理空间幻觉问题，KTO方法使性能提升29.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和方法有效提升了LLM在地理空间知识与推理任务中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19595)
*Yutao Sun,Zhenyu Li,Yike Zhang,Tengyu Pan,Bowen Dong,Yuyi Guo,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文综述了Transformer架构中自注意力机制的效率问题，介绍了线性注意力和稀疏注意力两种高效注意力机制，并探讨了其在大规模预训练语言模型中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，需要研究高效的注意力机制以提升模型的可扩展性。

Method: 线性注意力通过核近似、循环公式或快速权重动态实现线性复杂度；稀疏注意力通过固定模式、块路由或聚类策略选择部分token进行计算。

Result: 两种方法均显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了上下文覆盖能力，适用于大规模语言模型。

Conclusion: 该综述为设计和部署高效、可扩展的语言模型提供了理论和实践参考。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

### [6] [MOCHA: Are Code Language Models Robust Against Multi-Turn Malicious Coding Prompts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19598)
*Muntasir Wahed,Xiaona Zhou,Kiet A. Nguyen,Tianjiao Yu,Nirav Diwan,Gang Wang,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Ismini Lourentzou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出代码分解攻击，通过多轮对话分解恶意任务以绕过安全过滤，并引入MOCHA基准评估模型鲁棒性。微调后模型拒绝率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在对抗性多轮恶意提示下的鲁棒性不足问题。

Method: 提出代码分解攻击，构建MOCHA基准评估模型，并通过微调提升模型拒绝率。

Result: 实验显示模型在多轮场景下存在漏洞，微调后拒绝率提升32.4%。

Conclusion: 微调MOCHA能有效增强模型对抗性鲁棒性，且无需额外监督。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

### [7] [HITSZ's End-To-End Speech Translation Systems Combining Sequence-to-Sequence Auto Speech Recognition Model and Indic Large Language Model for IWSLT 2025 in Indic Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19616)
*Xuchen Wei,Yangxin Wu,Yaoyin Zhang,Henglyu Liu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HITSZ团队在IWSLT 2025 Indic赛道中提出了一种端到端系统，结合Whisper ASR模型和Krutrim LLM，提升了低资源语言对的翻译质量，并探索了Chain-of-Thought方法的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言对（英语与印度语言）的语音到文本翻译问题，提升翻译质量。

Method: 结合预训练的Whisper ASR模型和专为印度语言设计的Krutrim LLM，构建端到端系统，并尝试Chain-of-Thought方法。

Result: 平均BLEU分数为28.88（英译印）和27.86（印译英），Chain-of-Thought方法在某些情况下显著提升翻译质量（如泰米尔语到英语提升13.84 BLEU）。

Conclusion: 端到端系统有效，Chain-of-Thought方法有潜力但需解决输出格式一致性问题。

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

### [8] [MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634)
*Sara Papi,Maike Züfle,Marco Gaido,Beatrice Savoldi,Danni Liu,Ioannis Douros,Luisa Bentivogli,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCIF是一个多语言、多模态的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在多语言和多模态任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在多语言、多模态和长上下文评估方面存在不足，MCIF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于科学讲座构建多语言、多模态的人类标注数据集，涵盖语音、视觉和文本三种模态及四种语言。

Result: MCIF提供了全面的评估框架，支持跨语言和多模态的指令跟随能力测试。

Conclusion: MCIF的发布将促进多模态大型语言模型的开放研究和进步。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

*Andrei Vlad Man,Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu,Cristian-George Craciun,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop,Mihaela-Claudia Cercel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLMs和VLMs在理解和推理罗马尼亚驾驶法律方面的能力，并引入了RoD-TAL多模态数据集。实验表明，领域特定微调提升了检索性能，而思维链提示和专门推理模型提高了QA准确性，但视觉推理仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI与法律系统的交叉领域需要支持法律教育的工具，尤其是在资源不足的语言（如罗马尼亚语）中。

Method: 通过文本和视觉问答任务评估LLMs和VLMs的能力，引入RoD-TAL数据集，并测试了RAG管道、密集检索器和推理优化模型。

Result: 领域特定微调显著提升了检索性能，思维链提示和专门推理模型提高了QA准确性，但视觉推理表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs和VLMs在法律教育中具有潜力，但视觉推理仍是挑战。

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

### [10] [Towards Inclusive NLP: Assessing Compressed Multilingual Transformers across Diverse Language Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19699)
*Maitha Alshehhi,Ahmed Sharshar,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言和单语言大语言模型在阿拉伯语、英语和印度语言中的表现，重点探讨了模型压缩策略（如剪枝和量化）的影响。发现多语言模型普遍优于单语言模型，量化能保持准确性，但剪枝会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在高资源语言中表现优异，但在低资源语言（如阿拉伯语和印度语言）中的能力尚未充分了解，因此需要研究其表现及优化策略。

Method: 通过基准测试评估多语言和单语言大语言模型（如BLOOMZ、AceGPT等）在多种语言中的表现，并分析模型压缩策略（如剪枝和量化）的效果。

Result: 多语言模型表现优于单语言模型；量化（4位和8位）能保持准确性，但剪枝会显著降低性能，尤其是在大型模型中。

Conclusion: 研究为构建可扩展且公平的多语言NLP解决方案提供了关键策略，并强调需解决低资源环境中的幻觉和泛化错误。

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

### [11] [Ta-G-T: Subjectivity Capture in Table to Text Generation via RDF Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19710)
*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的三阶段管道方法，用于从表格数据生成包含主观性的文本，通过RDF三元组提取、文本聚合和主观性注入，实现了事实准确性与主观解释的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成方法主要关注客观描述，而忽略了主观性文本的生成，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三阶段管道：1) 提取RDF三元组；2) 聚合文本为连贯叙述；3) 注入主观性以丰富文本。使用小型T5模型而非大型语言模型。

Result: 在多项指标上表现优于Mistral-7B和Llama-2，与GPT-3.5性能相当，同时保持事实准确性和主观性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出了一种结构化管道，通过中间表示增强表格到文本生成的事实正确性和主观性。

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为基本阅读蒸馏（BRD）的方法，通过教育小型模型模仿大语言模型的基本阅读行为，从而在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）因高计算资源需求而难以实际部署的问题，同时弥补现有蒸馏方法忽视通用文本基础教育的不足。

Method: 通过基本阅读蒸馏（BRD）训练小型模型模仿LLMs的基本阅读行为（如命名实体识别、问答等），再应用于下游任务。

Result: 小型模型在语言推理和BIG-bench任务中表现优于或接近20倍大的LLMs。

Conclusion: BRD能有效影响小型模型的概率分布，且与知识蒸馏或任务蒸馏正交，为模型压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

TL;DR: JT-Math-8B是一系列开源模型，通过多阶段优化框架提升数学推理能力，在复杂问题上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在复杂数学问题上的不足，提升深度概念理解和多步推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段优化框架，包括基础模型、指导模型和思维模型，分别通过SFT、GRPO强化学习和长链思维训练。

Result: 在开源模型中达到领先水平，超越OpenAI的O1-mini和GPT-4o，尤其在竞赛级数学任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B通过系统优化和高质量数据，显著提升了数学推理能力，为AGI发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过计算工具分析了基督教小说的主题及其对神迹的描写，发现《末日迷踪》系列与其他基督教小说及男女作者作品间存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基督教小说的文化及文学层面，填补该领域学术空白，尤其是对神迹描写的分析。

Method: 结合人类注释者与轻量级语言模型，开发“神迹”定义及标注手册，并进行文本分析。

Result: 轻量级模型能匹配人类注释，且发现《末日迷踪》与其他作品及男女作者间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 计算工具能有效分析基督教小说，揭示其内部多样性及作者性别差异。

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B模型上，训练速度提升2.06倍，性能在AIME2025和BeyondAIME任务中显著提高。

Conclusion: UloRL方法有效提升了LLMs在超长序列生成中的推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

Motivation: 当前LLM处理长上下文存在挑战，包括长文本稀缺、计算成本高、短上下文能力下降等问题，现有方法依赖人工或LLM，成本高且多样性有限。

Method: Flora通过分类组合短指令，并基于长上下文元指令生成响应，实现任意长度和多样性的上下文构建。

Result: 实验表明，Flora增强的LLM在长上下文基准测试中表现优异，同时短上下文任务性能几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: Flora提供了一种高效、低成本的长上下文优化方案，为LLM的长上下文能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention是一种异构注意力计算框架，通过量化键、卸载值和动态KV淘汰，在极端内存限制下实现高效推理，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理长上下文输入时，KV缓存的内存需求巨大，现有压缩方法在内存减少超过85%时性能显著下降。

Method: 结合键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，兼容现有Transformer架构。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，KV缓存内存占用降至25%时仍保持全注意力模型的准确性，12.5%时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: HCAttention在LLM KV缓存压缩中达到新SOTA，首次在单A100 GPU上处理400万token。

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集未能捕捉真实驾驶对话中的不流畅特征（如犹豫、重复等），限制了对话AI的实际表现。

Method: 采用两阶段、提示驱动的合成方法，动态生成包含不流畅特征的多轮对话。

Result: DiscoDrive在训练和低资源数据增强中表现优异，显著提升了BLEU-4、METEOR等指标，并在人类评估中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: DiscoDrive填补了现有资源的空白，为训练和增强对话AI提供了多功能语料库。

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Result: 部分模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Claude-3-Opus）准确性接近人类，但多模态问题和语言差异仍存在性能差距。

Conclusion: 需进一步优化非英语医学AI模型，强调多语言和多模态评估的重要性，以确保医疗AI的公平可靠部署。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CaliDrop的新策略，通过校准增强令牌驱逐，以减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时减轻精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成过程中KV缓存的内存占用随序列长度、批大小和模型规模线性增长，成为长上下文场景的瓶颈。现有令牌驱逐方法虽能减少内存，但常导致精度显著下降。

Method: 提出CaliDrop策略，利用附近位置查询高度相似的观察，对丢弃的令牌进行推测性校准，以减少精度损失。

Result: 实验表明，CaliDrop显著提升了现有令牌驱逐方法的精度。

Conclusion: CaliDrop通过校准有效缓解了令牌驱逐带来的精度损失，为KV缓存压缩提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Motivation: 解决LLM输出中的社会偏见问题，确保公平性和减少潜在危害。

Method: 提出KLAAD框架，结合交叉熵、KL散度和三元组损失，隐式对齐注意力分布。

Result: 在BBQ和BOLD基准测试中，KLAAD有效减少了偏见，且对语言建模质量影响最小。

Conclusion: 注意力层面的对齐为生成语言模型中的偏见缓解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%

Conclusion: 混合评分模型在大规模写作评估中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language

Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human

language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文任务中KV缓存的高内存和计算需求，避免现有压缩方法导致的偏置表示。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法22%，在Needle-In-A-Haystack任务中展示位置无关的高检索精度。

Conclusion: FAEDKV提供了一种高效、无偏的KV缓存压缩方案，显著提升长上下文任务性能。

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

Method: 定义信息图元数据（标题、文本见解、子图表细节），提出Infogen框架：先由微调LLM生成元数据，再转换为信息图代码。

Result: Infogen在Infodat数据集上表现优异，优于闭源和开源LLM。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了复杂统计信息图生成问题，并提供了首个相关基准数据集和高效框架。

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种编译器框架，将DNN验证器的神经元级规范自动转换为基于张量的层级实现，解决了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN的不透明性使得基于抽象解释的验证成为建立信任的实用方法，但现有验证器开发困难，设计与实现之间存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出一种编译器框架，通过堆栈式中间表示和形状分析，将神经元级规范转换为张量级实现，并引入g-BCSR格式优化稀疏张量计算。

Result: 编译器框架实现了与手动优化实现相当的性能，同时简化了新验证器的开发。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证器的开发提供了灵活性和高效性，解决了语义鸿沟问题。

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Yue Yu,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 检索增强生成（RAG）通过整合推理时检索的外部知识提升大语言模型（LLMs）性能，但在多样化检索场景中的实际效果尚不明确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RAG在多样化知识源和真实场景中的表现，揭示其局限性。

Method: 使用大规模混合知识库MassiveDS评估RAG系统，分析检索对小模型的作用、重排器的价值及检索源的多样性影响。

Result: 发现检索对小模型更有效，重排器作用有限，且无单一检索源表现一致优异；LLMs难以在异构知识源中路由查询。

Conclusion: 需开发自适应检索策略以提升RAG在真实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can
be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ProsodyLM，一种改进语音语言模型的方法，通过新的标记化方案更好地学习韵律信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型在将语音转换为离散标记后输入LLMs时，难以有效学习韵律信息。

Method: 提出ProsodyLM，将语音转录为文本后添加词级韵律标记，保留更完整的韵律信息。

Result: ProsodyLM通过预训练即可学习多样化的韵律处理能力，如生成语音中的韵律细微差别、理解情感和重音等。

Conclusion: ProsodyLM在韵律处理方面表现出色，优于传统标记化方案。

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型生成高质量古英语文本的框架，填补了古英语在自然语言处理中的资源不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古英语资源匮乏，限制了现代自然语言处理技术的应用，保护古英语对理解人类文化和语言遗产至关重要。

Method: 结合参数高效微调（LoRA）、反向翻译数据增强和双代理流程（内容生成与翻译分离），生成高质量古英语文本。

Result: 自动评估指标（BLEU、METEOR、CHRF）显示显著提升，BLEU分数从26增至65以上；专家评估确认语法准确性和风格保真度高。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩展了古英语语料库，还为其他濒危语言的复兴提供了实用方案，将AI创新与文化保护目标相结合。

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sem-DPO是一种改进的DPO方法，通过语义一致性加权优化提示工程，显著提升生成图像的质量和用户偏好得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法在自动提示工程中存在语义不一致问题，导致生成的提示可能偏离用户意图。

Method: Sem-DPO在DPO损失函数中引入基于嵌入空间余弦距离的指数权重，软性降低语义不匹配提示的训练信号。

Result: 在三个标准文本到图像提示优化基准和两个语言模型上，Sem-DPO比DPO提高了8-12%的CLIP相似度和5-9%的人类偏好得分。

Conclusion: Sem-DPO通过语义加权显著提升了提示优化的效果，为语言模型中的语义感知偏好优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型（VLMs）在面对特定场景时容易产生幻觉，影响事实准确性，团队希望通过技术方案解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一个多阶段框架，包括轻量级查询路由、查询感知的检索与摘要、双路径生成及后验验证。

Result: 在Task 1中排名第三，验证了框架在提升多模态RAG系统可靠性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑答案可靠性的保守策略在多模态RAG系统中表现优异，团队方案具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文复杂布局文档理解任务中数据稀缺问题，尤其是低资源语言如阿拉伯语。

Method: 采用多代理交互框架，自动化生成长上下文单页和多页问题，覆盖英语和阿拉伯语文档。

Result: 生成的英语和阿拉伯语问题（AraEngLongBench）对主流开源和闭源LVLMs具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升LVLMs的长上下文理解能力提供了高效数据生成方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在多轮对话中难以保持目标导向行为，限制了其在对话AI中的可靠性。

Method: 引入UGST框架，采用三阶段方法开发用户模拟器，使其能自主追踪目标进展并生成目标对齐的响应。

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和τ-Bench两个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了目标对齐能力。

Conclusion: UGST填补了对话AI中的关键空白，成为开发目标对齐用户模拟器的重要框架。

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

TL;DR: SGPO是一种新型对齐框架，通过自我改进机制生成偏好数据，优化语言模型的对齐效果，无需依赖外部标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖人工标注数据，存在分布偏移和适用性限制，SGPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SGPO通过统一改进器和策略模型，利用监督微调输出生成高质量偏好数据，直接优化策略模型。

Result: 实验显示SGPO在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard上显著优于DPO和其他基线方法。

Conclusion: SGPO提供了一种高效、无需外部数据的语言模型对齐方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种意图树概念和数据集构建流程，创建了多模态基准SessionIntentBench，用于评估模型在复杂会话中理解意图转移的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效捕捉和建模用户意图，且缺乏数据和基准。

Method: 引入意图树概念，构建数据集SessionIntentBench，包含大量意图条目和会话轨迹。

Result: 实验表明当前模型难以捕捉复杂会话中的意图，但注入意图可提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集为理解用户意图提供了新途径，并验证了意图注入的有效性。

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在主观问题上表现受限，因其依赖单一真实答案或可验证奖励，导致推理同质化。研究发现增加角色视角能提升性能。

Method: 采用无监督数据构建管道生成多角色视角的推理链，并通过GRPO强化学习结合多样性奖励信号优化模型。

Result: 实验表明MultiRole-R1在六个基准测试中有效提升主客观推理能力，揭示了推理多样性与准确性的正相关关系。

Conclusion: 多样性增强训练在大型推理模型中具有潜力，MultiRole-R1展示了其在提升推理任务中的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

Result: 识别出一小部分潜在技能，能大部分解释模型性能，并开发了实用工具。

Conclusion: 新方法能更全面地评估模型性能，识别冗余任务，辅助模型选择，并分析模型的潜在技能。

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

Conclusion: 多视角新闻表示与双尺度用户建模结合有效提升推荐效果。

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

Result: 实验显示INT在治疗质量和深度上优于标准语言模型，并能生成高质量支持对话。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理健康支持提供了更有效的工具，展示了语言模型在专业治疗中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

Motivation: 专业性在专家沟通中至关重要，但在高风险领域（如金融）中研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入新的标注框架，量化提问中的结构和语用元素（如话语调节器、前言和请求类型），构建两个数据集（专业性和来源标注），并训练分类器。

Result: 相同的语言特征与人类判断和提问来源高度相关，基于这些特征的分类器在区分专家提问上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 专业性是可学习的、领域通用的概念，可通过语言建模捕捉。

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

Motivation: 当前语言模型训练通常在遇到结束标记时停止学习，忽略了完成后的潜在学习机会。PCL旨在利用这一空间提升模型能力。

Method: 设计了白盒强化学习方法，让模型根据奖励规则评估输出内容，并通过双轨SFT和RL混合训练优化推理和评估能力。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型上的实验表明，PCL优于传统SFT和RL方法。

Conclusion: PCL为语言模型训练提供了新技术路径，在提升输出质量的同时保持部署效率。

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

*Abeer Aldayel,Areej Alokaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估框架，通过分析对话中的隐含立场来提升NLP模型的包容性和公平性，避免依赖表面特征导致的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖用户人口统计或行为属性等表面特征，忽略了对话中隐含的意见表达，可能导致模型输出中的偏见和刻板印象。

Method: 引入了一个对齐评估框架，通过建模回应的立场来捕捉隐含意见，并结合PU在线学习和指令调优语言模型进行评估。

Result: 框架能够识别和评估隐含意见的表达，为模型行为提供了更包容的视角。

Conclusion: 通过关注隐含立场，该方法为提升NLP模型的包容性和公平性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

*Kang Yang,Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoL-RL是一种新的训练范式，通过双目标优化框架将多步环境反馈信号整合到LLMs中，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用多步离散的环境反馈信号，导致信息丢失或未能充分利用反馈交互。

Method: 结合MoL持续训练（解耦领域特定信号和通用语言能力）和GRPO后训练，将多步反馈蒸馏为单步推理。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，MoL-RL表现优异，尤其在Qwen3-8B模型上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MoL-RL为利用多步文本反馈增强LLMs推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究分析了多语言模型Aya-23-8B在代码混合、填空和翻译任务中的表现，发现其语言处理方式与单语言模型不同，揭示了多语言训练对模型内部结构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多语言大语言模型（LLMs）的内部语言处理机制，尤其是与单语言模型的差异。

Method: 使用logit lens和神经元专业化分析技术，比较Aya-23-8B与单语言模型（如Llama 3和Chinese-LLaMA-2）在代码混合、填空和翻译任务中的表现。

Result: 1. Aya-23在翻译时激活类型相关的语言表示；2. 代码混合的神经元激活模式受基础语言影响更大；3. 语言特定神经元集中在最终层。

Conclusion: 多语言训练显著影响LLMs的内部结构，为跨语言迁移研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了阿拉伯语方言（DA）与标准阿拉伯语（MSA）的翻译挑战，提出了两种方法：训练无关的提示技术和资源高效的微调流程。实验表明，few-shot提示优于其他方法，GPT-4o表现最佳；微调后的量化模型在多方言联合训练中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语方言与标准阿拉伯语的分歧限制了数字服务和教育资源的访问，阻碍了机器翻译的发展。研究旨在解决这一问题，推动方言包容性。

Method: 1. 评估了六种大型语言模型的训练无关提示技术；2. 开发了资源高效的微调流程，包括量化技术和多方言联合训练。

Result: few-shot提示表现最佳，GPT-4o在所有提示设置中表现最优；量化模型在多方言联合训练中性能提升10%以上，内存使用减少60%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的情况下，也能实现高质量的方言-标准语翻译，为阿拉伯语NLP的包容性提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

Method: 基于UK-DYNAMO框架，整合发音未指定性、分段和手势控制以及协同发音原理，模拟六个关键发音器。

Result: 模型成功生成了元音和辅音的发音配置，并嵌入了一个基于网络的应用程序中。

Conclusion: 当前模型专注于静态建模，未来将扩展动态运动生成和声学模块的集成。

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于角色中心化，简化了用户与角色的互动，无法反映实际应用需求。

Method: 引入RMTBench，基于用户动机构建对话，设计多轮对话模拟机制，并采用LLM评分。

Result: RMTBench通过关注用户意图实现，填补了学术评估与实际应用之间的差距。

Conclusion: RMTBench为评估LLMs角色扮演能力提供了更有效的框架，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）通过多头注意力机制编码输出序列长度信息，且长度控制与语义信息部分解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部如何控制输出序列长度的机制，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析模型内部表示，特别是多头注意力机制，调整特定隐藏单元以控制输出长度。

Result: 发现长度信息与语义信息部分解耦，且某些隐藏单元对长度特异性提示反应增强。

Conclusion: LLMs具备无需外部干预即可灵活控制输出长度的内部机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoT是一种基于认知分阶段的提示策略，通过感知、情境和规范三阶段提升视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理能力，在多项任务中表现优于传统CoT和直接提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT在需要同时感知、理解和判断的视觉任务中表现不佳，尤其是在涉及社会背景的任务中。因此，需要一种更符合认知过程的分阶段推理方法。

Method: 提出Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT)，将推理分为感知、情境和规范三个阶段，以增强模型的社会意识和可解释性。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，CoCoT平均比CoT和直接提示方法提升8%的性能。

Conclusion: CoCoT通过认知分阶段推理提升了VLM的可靠性和社会意识，为更安全的多模态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

TL;DR: CONCAP是一种多语言图像描述模型，通过结合检索到的描述和图像特定概念，减少多语言训练需求，提升低资源语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中表现不佳，主要由于多语言训练数据有限和大规模模型参数化的高成本。检索增强生成（RAG）是一种替代方案，但依赖从英语翻译的检索描述可能引入语言偏差。

Method: 提出CONCAP模型，整合检索到的描述和图像特定概念，增强输入图像的上下文理解，并支持多语言描述生成。

Result: 在XM3600数据集上的实验表明，CONCAP在低和中资源语言上表现优异，且数据需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 概念感知的检索增强能有效缩小多语言性能差距。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

Motivation: 研究NLU基准测试的现状，尤其是诊断数据集和语言现象覆盖的不足，旨在推动建立统一的评估标准。

Method: 通过详细比较和分析现有NLU基准测试，特别是其诊断数据集和语言现象覆盖范围，提出研究问题并支持未来标准制定。

Result: 发现现有基准测试缺乏命名规范和标准语言现象集，建议建立全球语言现象层次结构。

Conclusion: 提出需要制定类似ISO标准的NLU诊断评估标准，以支持更深入的模型比较和分析。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖输入上下文信息，但NER需结合详细标注要求，因此需改进LLMs的理解能力。

Result: 在10个基准测试中优于传统方法，验证了代码提示的有效性。

Conclusion: 代码提示能显式结构化NER指令，结合链式思维提示可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 封闭领域（如教育、医疗、法律）需要透明且可解释的QA系统，现有神经符号方法效率低且依赖大规模模型。

Method: 提出Text-JEPA框架，模拟双系统认知理论（System 1生成逻辑表示，System 2进行推理），并设计三个评估指标。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上，Text-JEPA性能接近大型LLM系统，但计算开销更低。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理框架在专业领域具有潜力，能构建高效且透明的QA系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

Conclusion: AQUA填补了水产养殖领域AI应用的空白，为行业提供了新的技术支持。

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated

of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic

that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty

findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable

Method: 标注了92个对话（720条推文），结合公共指标进行统计分析，探索主题和修辞维度的互动模式。

Result: 揭示了仇恨言论的传播方式、反仇恨策略及其潜在影响。

Conclusion: 研究为理解社交媒体中仇恨言论的传播和反制提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and
counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and
counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic
categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while
the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are
communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a
sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical
analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction
between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and
counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate
messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their
potential impact on online behavior.

Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地接触黑盒生成的文本，检测幻觉成为关键挑战。

Method: 利用幻觉一旦出现会持续的特点，采样未来上下文，并将其与多种采样方法结合。

Result: 实验表明，提出的采样方法显著提升了多种方法的性能。

Conclusion: 采样未来上下文是检测黑盒生成器幻觉的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on
online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users
increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has
become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰等）对平台安全和社会福祉构成挑战，现有研究多关注事后检测，而预测性方法旨在提前预防。

Method: 通过系统综述49项研究，提出了五种任务分类法，并分析了建模技术（从传统机器学习到预训练语言模型）及数据集特征的影响。

Conclusion: 本文通过统一框架梳理了ASB预测领域，为未来研究提供了方向，以实现更稳健和社会责任导向的预测。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的知识图谱补全方法依赖隐式知识表示，容易传播错误知识，导致推理结果不明确。论文旨在结合神经感知结构信息与本体知识，提升LLM对知识内在逻辑的理解。

Method: 提出OL-KGC方法：1）利用神经感知机制将结构信息嵌入文本空间；2）通过自动化算法从知识图谱中提取本体知识并转换为LLM可理解的文本格式，提供逻辑指导。

Result: 在FB15K-237、UMLS和WN18RR三个基准测试中，OL-KGC显著优于主流方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OL-KGC通过结合结构信息和本体知识，有效提升了LLM在知识图谱补全中的推理能力，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理异常重要性加权奖励时存在策略更新不稳定的问题，GMPO旨在通过几何平均优化解决这一问题。

Method: GMPO通过最大化几何平均奖励而非算术平均，减少对异常值的敏感性，保持重要性采样比的稳定范围。

Result: GMPO-7B在多个数学和多模态推理基准测试中表现优于GRPO，平均提升4.1%和1.4%。

Conclusion: GMPO通过几何平均优化提升了稳定性和性能，为语言模型的推理能力提供了更可靠的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

TL;DR: 研究发现，在多语言事实核查任务中，小型专用模型（如XLM-R）表现优于大型通用模型（如Llama 3.1等），XLM-R的宏F1分数达到57.7%，远超大型模型的16.9%。


<details>

Motivation: 多语言错误信息的快速传播需要能够处理细粒度真实性评估的自动化事实核查系统，但大型语言模型在此任务中的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 在X-Fact数据集上评估了五种最先进的语言模型，包括小型编码器模型（XLM-R、mT5）和大型解码器模型（Llama 3.1等），采用提示和微调方法。

Result: XLM-R（2.7亿参数）显著优于所有测试的大型模型（70-120亿参数），宏F1分数为57.7%，比之前的最佳结果（41.9%）提高了15.8%。

Conclusion: 对于细粒度多语言事实核查，小型专用模型可能比通用大型模型更有效，这对事实核查系统的实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: Text2VLM是一个多阶段管道，用于将纯文本数据集转换为多模态格式，以评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对排版提示注入攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估数据集主要针对纯文本提示，忽略了视觉漏洞，因此需要一种方法来全面评估VLMs在多模态内容中的安全性。

Method: Text2VLM通过识别原始文本中的有害内容并将其转换为排版图像，生成多模态提示，用于评估VLMs的脆弱性。

Result: 开源VLMs在引入视觉输入后更容易受到提示注入攻击，且性能与闭源前沿模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Text2VLM为全面安全评估提供了可扩展工具，有助于开发更强大的VLM安全机制，推动其在实际应用中的安全部署。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过结构剪枝和高效恢复训练直接压缩多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，以解决其高计算和内存需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs的高计算和内存需求限制了实际部署，现有参数缩减方法灵活性不足且计算成本高。

Method: 采用层间和宽度剪枝两种范式，结合监督微调和知识蒸馏进行恢复训练，并评估少量数据的可行性。

Result: 宽度剪枝在低资源场景下表现更优；仅微调多模态投影器即可在小压缩比（<20%）下恢复性能；5%数据可保留95%性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩MLLMs提供了实用方案，无需大量计算资源或数据，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要一种无需大量标注数据的跨语言忠实性评估方法。

Method: 利用合成多语言摘要数据，结合跨语言迁移学习，比较语言特定和混合语言微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，框架在跨语言忠实性评估中优于现有基线，包括最先进的英语评估器和机器翻译方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言忠实性评估提供了一种高效且无需依赖标注数据的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

Conclusion: 本文为研究者和新人提供了关于GPTE当前状态和未来潜力的全面参考，强调了PLMs在推动其发展中的关键作用。

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

TL;DR: 本文评估了一种自动化语言模型工具（PFD Toolkit）在分析英格兰和威尔士验尸官发布的预防未来死亡（PFD）报告中的效果，发现其能高效、可靠地替代手动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动分析PFD报告耗时且效率低，需要一种自动化工具提高分析效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用PFD Toolkit对4,249份PFD报告进行自动化筛选和主题分析，并与手动分析结果对比验证。

Result: 自动化工具识别出72份儿童自杀PFD报告（是手动分析的两倍），且与临床专家标注的一致性高（Cohen's κ = 0.82）。

Conclusion: 自动化语言模型分析可高效、可靠地替代手动分析，为公共卫生提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

TL;DR: DEP框架通过潜在空间建模用户差异，优于依赖语言提示的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖用户历史或语言提示，未能有效捕捉用户间差异，影响个性化效果。

Method: DEP利用潜在空间对比用户嵌入与同行嵌入，通过稀疏自编码器提取任务相关特征，注入冻结LLM。

Result: 在个性化评论生成任务中，DEP在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DEP通过潜在空间建模用户差异，显著提升个性化效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，多样性在NLP中受到更多关注，但缺乏系统性理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白，促进对多样性的更好理解和比较。

Method: 调查了ACL Anthology过去6年标题含“多样性”或“多样”的文章，提出统一的多样性分类法，并基于Stirling框架（多样性、平衡性和差异性）进行分析。

Result: 发现多样性测量在NLP中术语不一致且高度专业化，通过统一框架揭示了多样性研究的趋势。

Conclusion: 本研究为NLP中多样性的形式化提供了基础，有望提升对该概念的理解和不同方法间的可比性。

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告信息丰富但非结构化且使用领域特定语言，现有专有LLM存在透明度和隐私问题，需开源替代方案。

Method: 开发了公开框架llm_extractinator，在零样本设置下评估开源LLM在DRAGON基准（28个荷兰语临床任务）中的表现。

Result: 14B参数模型（如Phi-4-14B）表现接近更大模型（如Llama-3.3-70B），但计算成本更低；翻译会降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM结合专用框架可为低资源临床信息提取提供高效、可扩展且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

### [75] [Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906)
*Jungwon Park,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Soft Injection的新方法，通过任务嵌入和注意力头激活的软混合，显著提升了ICL的性能，同时减少了内存和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ICL方法依赖多示例提示，效率低下且效果不明确，因此需要一种更高效的任务信息传递方式。

Method: 使用少量示例构建任务嵌入，并通过预优化的混合参数（软头选择参数）将任务嵌入与注意力头激活软混合。

Result: 在57个任务和12个LLM上的评估显示，该方法平均比10-shot ICL性能提升10.1%-13.9%，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: Soft Injection方法通过将任务条件从提示空间转移到激活空间，为减少提示长度和提升任务性能提供了新范式。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical
subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with
Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii)
Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中性别歧视问题日益严重，EXIST挑战赛旨在通过技术手段识别和分类性别歧视内容。

Method: 使用SCBM（基于形容词的瓶颈概念）、SCBMT（结合形容词和Transformer）和微调的XLM-RoBERTa模型，分别处理三个子任务。

Result: XLM-RoBERTa在部分任务中排名靠前，SCBMT表现中等但提供了解释性。

Conclusion: 模型在性能和解释性上取得平衡，未来可结合更多元数据优化结果。

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在金融等高风险领域中的幻觉问题，提高生成内容的可靠性。

Method: 基于用户定义的错误分类法构建合成数据集，微调Phi-4、Phi-4-mini、Qwen3-4B和Qwen3-14B模型以检测和编辑事实错误。

Result: 微调后的Phi-4模型在二元F1分数上提升了8%，整体检测性能提升了30%；Phi-4-mini模型性能接近OpenAI-o3，仅下降2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融文本生成提供了实用的解决方案，并提出了可推广的框架，增强大语言模型的可信度和对齐性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令调优对语言模型输出多样性的影响，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分析OLMo和OLMo 2模型的微调阶段，研究多样性损失，并提出conformative解码策略。

Result: 指令调优显著降低多样性，DPO影响最大；conformative解码能恢复多样性并保持质量。

Conclusion: conformative解码是一种有效的策略，可在指令调优后恢复模型输出的多样性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Motivation: 医疗领域数据隐私敏感，研究旨在揭示微调过程中记忆数据的机制，以平衡模型性能与隐私风险。

Method: 采用成员推理攻击检测记忆数据，并通过生成任务评估逐字复制。分析了Transformer架构中不同权重矩阵、困惑度与记忆的关系，以及LoRA微调中秩的影响。

Result: 发现Value和Output矩阵对记忆贡献更大；低困惑度模型记忆更强；高LoRA秩增加记忆但边际效应递减。

Conclusion: 研究为微调LLM时的性能与隐私权衡提供了见解，有助于开发更有效且负责任的模型适应策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM评估方法中角色设计随意和框架通用性不足的问题。

Method: 自动从文本中构建评估者角色，利用LLM代理进行群体辩论，生成多维反馈。

Result: 在教育与医疗领域的实验中，MAJ-EVAL的结果更接近人类专家评分。

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL提供了一种更贴近人类视角的多维评估方法。

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，自动计算伽马值以提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降，表现为低对比度、噪声和细节模糊，亟需有效增强方法。

Method: 通过分析图像颜色亮度和平均颜色，自适应计算伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型显著提升了低光照图像质量，保持了细节、自然对比度和正确色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是一种高效的低光照图像处理解决方案，适用于夜间监控、医学图像增强等场景。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和制定治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法面临肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性的挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，并通过形态学边界细化处理模糊边界。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet的肝脏和肿瘤分割DSC分别达到97.6%/89.1%和98.3%/83.3%，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的肝脏和肿瘤自动分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理手术器械的实例级分割（IIS）或部分级语义分割（PSS），缺乏任务间的交互，限制了自动化手术的准确性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，引入部分特定查询，将部分与父器械实例显式关联，并通过弱监督学习和师生方法利用部分标注数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，在PIS、IIS、PSS和器械级语义分割任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一框架和弱监督学习，显著提升了手术器械分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在多种医学影像模态中展现出强大的泛化能力和检测性能，有望推动医学影像检测系统的进步。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image

TL;DR: SynPAIN是一个大规模合成数据集，用于解决疼痛评估中的多样性和隐私问题，特别针对老年痴呆患者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疼痛检测数据集缺乏种族/民族多样性、隐私保护不足，且老年人群代表性不足，SynPAIN旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建了包含10,710张面部表情图像的合成数据集，涵盖五种种族/民族、两个年龄组和两种性别。

Result: 验证显示合成疼痛表情符合预期模式，并通过数据增强提高了真实临床数据的疼痛检测性能（平均精度提升7.0%）。

Conclusion: SynPAIN为疼痛评估研究提供了首个公开的多样化合成数据集，并建立了测量和缓解算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于半监督学习的标签高效方法，利用未标记数据和DPO优化紧凑型VLMs，显著提升了电商产品属性预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调VLMs时标注成本高的问题，探索如何利用未标记数据提升模型性能。

Method: 结合PEFT和DPO，通过生成多推理链并基于自一致性分类，利用未标记数据迭代优化低秩适配器模块。

Result: 在12个电商领域的数据集上，DPO微调显著优于监督模型，且性能随未标记数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: 半监督DPO微调能高效利用未标记数据，为电商属性预测提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和独立变异，并在ADNI数据中发现了生物学上合理的共变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Conclusion: Co-Win提升了自动驾驶系统的下游决策和规划能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 研究强调了偏见问题的严重性，并提供了分析框架和案例研究，为未来减少偏见提供了方向。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Result: uQRPCA+在移动目标检测和背景恢复任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: uQRPCA+是一种高效且性能优越的移动目标检测和背景恢复方法。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 通过LiDAR深度信息提升立体匹配的准确性，尤其是在LiDAR点稀疏的情况下。

Method: 提出预填充稀疏初始视差图的方法，并结合早期融合中的LiDAR深度注入。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo方法在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新的思路和解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Conclusion: LOMM通过创新的内存管理和对象关联策略，显著提升了视频实例分割的长期跟踪能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰技术引发了对面部图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而如何从修饰后的图像中准确恢复原始面部尚未解决。

Method: 提出MoFRR模型，采用专家混合策略，包括处理特定修饰类型的专家和共享专家。每个专家采用双分支结构，结合DDIM低频分支和HFCAM高频分支。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验证明了MoFRR的有效性。

Conclusion: MoFRR为面部修饰恢复任务提供了一种创新且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在自监督表示学习中取得了成功，但其具体学习机制尚未完全明确。本文旨在揭示MAE的学习本质，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过深入分析发现MAE早期即学习补丁级聚类模式，基于此提出自引导MAE，利用聚类信息生成智能掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了MAE的学习效率，且无需依赖外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导MAE通过智能掩码生成机制，有效改进了传统MAE的性能，同时保持了自监督学习的优势。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在点云学习中占主导地位，但其二次复杂度限制了点间交互，难以建模长程依赖。状态空间模型（S6）因其线性复杂度和优秀的长程建模能力被引入点云学习，但仍存在序列化不完善和局部学习不足的问题。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性；提出ConvBiS6层协同捕获局部几何和全局上下文依赖；扩展S6为MHS6以增强建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在对象级和场景级任务上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，有效解决了点云学习中的长程依赖和局部几何捕获问题，性能优越。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Result: 在合成和真实湍流数据集上，JDATT在视觉恢复和检测精度上表现优异，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT通过联合蒸馏实现了高效的大气湍流抑制和目标检测，适合资源受限的实时应用。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过生成逼真训练数据，解决了视频显著目标检测的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Result: 在公开VOS基准测试中达到最新最优性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: DepthFlow是一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，显著提升了VOS模型的训练效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法为在资源受限环境中部署高效计算机视觉模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用尚未充分探索，且固定查询数量限制了灵活性。学习过程中存在ROT和查询模糊性问题，影响解码器效率。

Method: 引入单查询范式，将固定查询转为灵活查询；通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，分别处理定位和去重任务；提出PoCoo损失函数优化小目标检测。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上的实验表明，DS-Det具有高效性和优越性。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和解耦学习解决了现有问题，提升了检测性能，适用于不同主干模型。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了Stable Diffusion注意力机制在像素级标注任务中的潜力，为自动化标注提供了新思路。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

TL;DR: FM-LC框架通过多阶段方法提高干旱地区洪水地图的准确性，显著优于传统单阶段方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重威胁，但传统洪水地图方法因光谱对比度低、水文动态快和城市覆盖异质性高而受限。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段方法：1) 多类U-Net初步分割；2) 针对易混淆类训练轻量级二分类模型；3) 贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在迪拜2024年4月风暴事件中，FM-LC平均F1分数提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架显著提升了干旱地区洪水地图的精度，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Motivation: 现代城市环境中，摄像头网络生成的海量视频数据需要高效处理，但现有SQL范式限制了查询的灵活性，因此探索自然语言驱动的视频分析范式。

Method: Lava系统包括：1）基于多臂老虎机的高效采样方法；2）视频专用开放世界检测模块；3）长期目标轨迹提取方案。

Result: 实验表明，Lava在查询F1分数上提升14%，聚合查询误差降低0.39，处理速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: Lava通过自然语言查询和多粒度分析，显著提升了视频分析的灵活性和效率。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展性问题。

Method: 使用1D CNN进行时间压缩处理姿态序列，结合预训练的AraGPT2解码器直接生成文本（glosses）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，AutoSign的WER得分比现有最佳方法提高了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过简化流程和直接学习文本依赖关系，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Motivation: 解决负提示调优在提升OOD检测能力时导致的泛化性能下降问题。

Method: 结合负特征调优（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）策略，NFT通过分布感知变换分离正负特征，KR优化策略增强ID和OOD的区分并减少预训练知识遗忘。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著提升了ID分类准确率和OOD检测性能，FPR95降低了5.44%。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在提升OOD检测能力的同时，有效保持了模型的泛化性能，适用于未见类和风格的场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM

editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Mamba的方法在建模关节依赖关系时忽略了运动特性的内在差异，无法均匀处理所有关节运动轨迹。

Method: SAMA框架包含结构感知状态积分器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM），分别用于融合关节特征和状态信息，以及识别关节特定运动特性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAMA以较低计算成本取得了先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAMA通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

Motivation: 现有融合方法在4D雷达和单目图像的3D目标检测中缺乏全局场景理解或受限于固定网格结构，RaGS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RaGS采用级联流程，包括基于视锥的定位初始化（FLI）、迭代多模态聚合（IMA）和多级高斯融合（MGF），动态优化高斯场表示。

Conclusion: RaGS通过3D高斯泼溅实现了高效且灵活的3D目标检测，为自动驾驶传感器融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过数据高效训练和可视化工具显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，有效解决了多任务MedIR的异质性问题。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态对齐多模态线索和特征建模，显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索联邦域泛化在自动驾驶语义分割中的潜力，解决现有方法未充分研究的问题。

Method: 提出FedS2R框架，包括不一致性驱动的数据增强和多客户端知识蒸馏。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，全局模型显著优于单个客户端模型，仅比全数据训练模型低2 mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效提升了合成到真实语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

*Drandreb Earl O. Juanico,Rowel O. Atienza,Jeffrey Kenneth Go*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RCA的插件方法，通过重新加权最终层注意力来增强视觉语言Transformer中的目标定位能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉语言Transformer在目标定位任务中的性能，尤其是针对语义相关但被抑制的token。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并放大中等激活值来重新加权最终层注意力，引入FitAP作为新的评估指标。

Result: 在15个开源VLM中，11个模型的FitAP得到提升，最高提升26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提高了性能，还增强了多模态Transformer的可解释性。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Method: 结合参数高效适配器、混合几何专家架构（MoGE）和时序上下文优化策略。

Result: 在三个常用基准测试中取得最优性能，表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D为统一模型的重要性提供了启示，并推动大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度子空间聚类（DSC）的小批量训练策略，通过引入记忆库保存全局特征表示，克服了传统全批量处理的瓶颈。同时，提出了一种无解码器框架，利用对比学习替代自编码器，显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSC方法依赖全批量处理，无法高效训练高分辨率图像。为解决这一问题，研究团队提出了小批量训练策略和无解码器框架。

Method: 1. 引入记忆库保存全局特征表示，支持小批量训练；2. 提出无解码器框架，利用对比学习进行表示学习。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上，该方法性能优于全批量方法和其他先进子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了传统DSC的计算瓶颈，还通过无解码器设计提升了效率，为大规模预训练编码器的微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Result: HumanSAM在二元和多类伪造分类中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和增强策略，提高了伪造检测的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: LLM_Control在多种预训练T2I模型上表现出色，生成质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLM_Control能够有效处理复杂输入条件，提升可控T2I生成的精确性。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Conclusion: 结合CNN和Transformer的融合方法有效解决了事件与图像融合的挑战。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution

Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上展示了强大的零样本检测能力，并可扩展至少样本场景。

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在视觉异常检测中表现出高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: FROSS为实时3D语义场景图生成提供了高效解决方案，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于OCTA图像的多功能心血管疾病风险评估方法，结合血管轨迹和形态特征，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，现有方法无法捕捉关键血管特征且分类粗糙，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 提出VAMPIRE模型，包含Mamba-Based Directional模块和信息增强形态模块，用于提取血管特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有分类模型和OCTA检测方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为心血管疾病风险评估提供了更精准的工具，OCTA-CVD数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes
and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at

TL;DR: RICE提出了一种增强区域级视觉和OCR能力的新方法，通过构建大规模候选区域数据集和设计统一的区域聚类判别损失，显著提升了密集预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务（如定位、OCR和分割）中的效果。RICE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了十亿级候选区域数据集，提出区域Transformer层提取区域语义，并设计统一的区域聚类判别损失，支持对象和OCR学习。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和MLLM视觉感知任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RICE通过区域级表示学习，显著提升了密集预测任务的性能，预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的测试时间主动学习（TTAL）框架，用于在实时数据流中动态更新提示并查询不确定样本，解决了单样本实时处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在连续数据流中有效利用预言机，同时满足延迟和内存限制，适用于安全关键应用。

Result: 在10个跨数据集转移基准和4个领域泛化数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持合理的延迟和内存开销。

Conclusion: TTAL框架为自动驾驶和医疗诊断等安全关键应用提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

### [136] [FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056)
*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器解决了Vision Mamba在医学图像分割中的高频信息缺失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等问题，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能解决部分问题，但引入了新的高频信息缺失和空间结构退化问题。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）和自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE），分别通过多频带谱重建和像素级重建恢复高频信息和空间相关性。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上，FaRMamba优于现有CNN-Transformer混合模型和Mamba变体，边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性表现更优。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了灵活的频域感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战，且计算开销可控。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS标记的偏见，生成更长、更详细的图像描述，无需复杂奖励函数或监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型生成的图像描述通常简短且缺乏细节，主要原因是交叉熵训练中引入的EOS标记偏见。

Method: 提出一种无监督方法，减少模型过早预测EOS标记的倾向，从而鼓励生成更详细的描述。

Result: 在三个视觉语言模型和三个详细描述基准测试中，显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，但幻觉率也有所上升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于任何预训练模型，显著提升了描述的详细程度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注姿态准确性，但忽略了全局图像质量，KB-DMGen旨在同时优化这两者。

Method: 通过知识库（KB）增强姿态准确性并利用图像特征信息，动态掩码（DM）调整姿态相关区域的重要性。

Result: 在HumanArt数据集上，KB-DMGen在AP和CAP指标上达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: KB-DMGen通过结合知识库和动态掩码，显著提升了人像生成的姿态准确性和全局质量。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的局部提示适配方法（LPA），通过分解提示为内容和风格标记，选择性注入U-Net注意力层，提升布局控制和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂提示下生成图像时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性，限制了可控内容生成的应用。

Method: 将提示分解为内容和风格标记，分阶段选择性注入U-Net注意力层。

Result: 在CLIP分数和风格一致性指标上优于现有方法（如Composer、MultiDiffusion等）。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的扩散生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Result: 实验表明，HDST在真实和合成数据集上均显著提升了去噪性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: HDST为高光谱图像及其他高维视觉数据的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新思路和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Motivation: 内上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨轮廓不连续，学习正常骨骼结构有助于检测异常。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器框架，学习正常骨骼结构的连续性，通过重建误差检测异常。

Result: 在16名棒球运动员的数据集上，像素级AUC达0.965，图像级AUC达0.967。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有方法，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Result: DR-MSV提高点云特征提取效率与精度，TAP-LME在语义表示上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM为3D场景感知提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线视频分割中时间一致性不足的问题，如噪声积累、遮挡和场景突变。

Method: 基于DETR框架，引入局部和全局查询，使用L2G-aligner进行早期对齐，无需复杂启发式或内存机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP分别达54.3、49.4和37.0。

Conclusion: Local2Global框架简单高效，显著提升在线视频分割的时间一致性和性能。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Result: 在Plant Village和PlantDoc数据集上，Mo-DsCC在准确率和F1分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智慧农业提供了实用工具，并为学术界和工业界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

Result: 在DVTOD、DroneVehicle和M3FD数据集上，WMNet实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: WMNet有效解决了跨模态错位问题，提升了目标检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在监督式低光图像增强研究中，增强图像与真实图像之间的亮度不匹配问题被忽视，影响了模型训练效果。

Method: 提出GT-mean loss，从概率角度直接建模图像均值，扩展现有损失函数，计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss能显著提升多种方法和数据集的性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss是一种简单有效的解决方案，可广泛应用于低光图像增强任务。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小型VLM的数据过滤框架，用于提升视觉语言模型训练数据的质量，减少噪声数据的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）需要高质量的训练数据，但现有方法通常依赖大规模但噪声较多的数据。研究发现，精心筛选的数据比单纯增加数据量更有效。

Method: 利用一个基于高质量图像-标注数据集微调的小型VLM，评估并过滤训练样本的图像和标注质量及其对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，经过过滤的数据集性能优于或等同于大规模但噪声较多的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案，用于构建高质量的视觉语言训练数据。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

Motivation: 动画着色在动画制作中至关重要，但现有方法难以实现颜色准确性和时间一致性。

Method: 结合草图序列到DiT视频扩散模型中，引入高级颜色提取器（HCE）和低级颜色引导器（LCG），并采用多阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: AnimeColor不仅推动了动画着色技术的发展，还为工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态提示的玩家身份感知体育视频字幕生成方法（LLM-IAVC），通过提取玩家相关多模态嵌入和视频上下文信息，结合大语言模型生成包含玩家身份的描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育视频字幕方法常忽略玩家身份，导致描述不完整或错误。本文旨在通过视觉角度识别玩家身份，提升字幕的准确性和实用性。

Method: 设计了身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合玩家识别网络（PIN）和双向语义交互模块（BSIM），生成多模态提示输入大语言模型。

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上实验表明，模型性能优越。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过多模态信息融合，显著提升了体育视频字幕中玩家身份的识别和描述准确性。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMPS，一种用于Temporal Point Clouds（TPC）数据的自编码器架构，解决了TPC格式在运动任务学习中的挑战，并在运动合成任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨骼结构的差异，运动数据难以跨骨架传输，TPC提供了一种兼容性强的运动表示方式，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过独立降维帧级点云为可采样特征向量，并利用潜在高斯噪声向量作为采样标识符重构TPC，引入线性分配优化重建过程。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到最先进水平，微调后进一步超越其他方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS为TPC数据提供了一种高效的运动合成解决方案，展示了其通用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）需要精确的空间感知，但VLMs的空间关系识别和运动感知能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 构建了一个合成数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类，并设计了相应的测试任务。

Result: 人类在测试中表现近乎完美，而VLMs仅在两个最简单任务上达到人类水平，其他任务表现显著较差，部分任务得分接近零。

Conclusion: VLMs的空间理解能力仍有显著提升空间，提出的基准测试为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视光照变化导致模态偏差，需一种自适应融合方法。

Method: 采用光照门控的MoCTE，结合高低光照专家子网络和CTFB模块，动态分配模态权重，并通过多阶段堆叠优化信息融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP达70.93%（MFNet）和45.14%（DroneVehicle）。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse有效解决光照变化问题，提升融合性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（如SAM）在复杂任务中性能下降，现有适配器方法因特征提取受限效果有限。

Method: 利用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复数适配器捕捉复数空间-频率信息。

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有适配方法，且适用于SAM和SAM2架构。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为适配分割模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model

We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Conclusion: 该模型有效整合全局和局部特征，提升了矿区复杂场景的分类能力。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Conclusion: MambaMap在时域建模和计算效率上具有显著优势。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全局到局部的高斯分布策略和能量引导的多分辨率训练框架，显著加速了3D高斯溅射的训练过程，并提升了重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（GS）在高质量场景重建中表现优异，但训练过程收敛慢，主要由于高斯基元的低效密集化和次优空间分布。

Method: 通过分析分裂和克隆操作，提出全局到局部密集化策略，并结合能量引导的多分辨率训练框架和动态剪枝。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法实现了超过2倍的训练加速，使用更少的高斯基元且重建性能更优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了GS训练中的效率问题，同时保持了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: AnimalClue是一个大规模数据集，用于从间接证据（如足迹、粪便等）识别物种，填补了野生动物监测中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注动物外观的直接视觉特征，而间接证据的物种识别研究较少，但其对野生动物监测至关重要。

Method: 构建包含159,605个边界框的AnimalClue数据集，涵盖五类间接证据和968个物种，并标注物种标签、边界框和细粒度特征。

Result: 实验评估了代表性视觉模型，揭示了从动物痕迹识别物种的关键挑战。

Conclusion: AnimalClue为间接证据的物种识别提供了新资源，并指出了未来研究的改进方向。

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效的基础模型，适用于少量数据的快速适应和准确解码。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and
23x fewer FLOPs than MCTrans. It maintains over 92% accuracy even under 50%
spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的人工智能变得至关重要。然而，深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性，影响可靠性。

Method: 通过协方差矩阵量化目标与偏差特征的线性相关性，并利用白化模块消除这种相关性。无需正则化项或对抗学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（Corrupted CIFAR-10、Biased FFHQ、WaterBirds和Celeb-A）上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整权重系数平衡算法效用与公平性，且无需复杂优化，显著提升了模型的可靠性和公平性。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法在不同事件的短新闻视频中存在分布偏移问题，尤其在突发新闻中性能显著下降。

Method: 设计了基于掩码语言建模（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，通过多模态（音频和视频）上下文信息预测被掩码的文本，并在测试时训练阶段适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了模型的有效性，特别是在突发新闻检测方面表现优异。

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架通过测试时训练和自监督任务显著提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Transfer VAE Training (TVT)策略，通过将8倍下采样的VAE转换为4倍下采样的VAE，同时适配预训练的UNet，以提升图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散(SD)模型的真实图像超分辨率方法在重建图像精细结构（如小字符和纹理）时表现不佳，主要原因是SD模型中VAE的激进分辨率降低（8倍下采样）。

Method: 提出TVT策略：首先基于原始VAE编码器的输出特征训练一个4倍下采样的解码器，然后固定新解码器并训练4倍下采样的编码器。此外，优化网络架构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，TVT方法显著改善了精细结构的保留效果，同时计算量低于现有的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT方法有效解决了SD模型中VAE下采样率过高的问题，提升了图像超分辨率的精细结构重建能力，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT是一种快速跨传感器适应框架，通过无监督采样和敏感权重更新，显著减少适应时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重新训练。

Method: 采用无监督采样策略选择目标域中最具信息量的样本，通过梯度分析识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: SWIFT将适应时间从几小时缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基准，甚至媲美全量重新训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，性能达到新标杆。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Result: 实现了在动态手腕场景中插入手镯的高保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法首次将3D渲染与2D扩散模型结合，为视频编辑提供了更真实和一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上达到88.94%的检测准确率，检测延迟约为7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

Motivation: 面部美感预测（FBP）因主观性和复杂特征而具挑战性，现有方法难以学习与美学评估对齐的特征表示。

Result: 在FBP5500基准上取得PCC 0.932，显著优于通用预训练方法。

Conclusion: 生成式预训练策略是性能提升的关键，为主观视觉任务提供更语义化的特征表示。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Result: 在四项任务上的实验验证了数据集支持高保真、细粒度和可控生成的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集和基准测试填补了卡通动画多模态数据的空白，支持多种生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

*Alexandru Brateanu,Raul Balmez,Ciprian Orhei,Codruta Ancuti,Cosmin Ancuti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModalFormer是一个多模态低光照图像增强框架，利用九种辅助模态和跨模态Transformer实现最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态的上下文信息，导致低光照图像增强效果受限。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，通过CM-MSA机制融合RGB数据与多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，达到当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过多模态信息融合显著提升了低光照图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR数据稀疏性和遮挡问题，提升3D标注的语义粒度。

Method: 融合LiDAR和相机数据，利用视觉语言模型进行开放词汇标注和点云域检测质量优化。

Result: 在Nuscenes数据集上，VESPA在物体发现和多类物体检测中分别达到52.95%和46.54%的AP。

Conclusion: VESPA展示了在可扩展3D场景理解中的强大性能。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非手动面部特征在自动手语识别（ASLR）中的重要性，发现嘴部是最关键的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中至关重要，但在ASLR中研究不足，现有方法多依赖手工特征提取且未深入比较不同面部区域的作用。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）在孤立手语数据集上系统评估眼睛、嘴部和全脸的作用。

Result: 嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提高了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在ASLR中整合面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Method: 竞赛分为两个赛道：Track 1评估算法，Track 2评估数据集；启用自动评估平台，并共享新的ID卡数据集。

Result: Track 1中“Dragons”团队表现最佳（AV-Rank 40.48%，EER 11.44%）；Track 2中“Incode”团队表现最优（AV-Rank 14.76%，EER 6.36%）。

Conclusion: ID卡的PAD技术有所提升，但真实图像数量仍是挑战。

Abstract: This work summarises and reports the results of the second Presentation
Attack Detection competition on ID cards. This new version includes new
elements compared to the previous one. (1) An automatic evaluation platform was
enabled for automatic benchmarking; (2) Two tracks were proposed in order to
evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,
respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it
is still a challenging problem related to the number of images, especially of
bona fide images.

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.95%，并通过多项性能指标验证其可靠性。

Conclusion: 该系统为印度聋哑社区提供了高效的沟通工具，展示了机器学习在手语翻译中的潜力。

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其在细粒度视觉元素处理上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 结合注意力定位和迭代优化的视觉推理框架$A^2R^2$，支持模型自校正和逐步优化预测。

Result: $A^2R^2$在六项评估指标上显著优于基线方法，推理轮次增加带来性能提升，消融实验和人工评估验证其有效性。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$框架通过视觉推理和迭代优化有效提升Img2LaTeX任务性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Method: 利用自监督模型的基础模型训练下游模型，通过其泛化能力减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 基础模型的应用为工作适应性预测提供了新机会，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 深度学习和基础模型结合为生物识别设备的扩展应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合学习和优化混合形状表示，显著提升了说话头合成的效果，为音频驱动的唇同步提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: SparseVAR是一种无需额外训练的加速框架，通过动态排除低频token减少计算开销，显著提升视觉自回归模型的推理速度，同时保持高质量图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉自回归模型在高分辨率阶段因大量token导致计算开销巨大，而低频token对图像质量影响较小且与邻近token相似，因此提出动态排除低频token的加速方法。

Method: SparseVAR利用轻量级MSE指标识别低频token，并通过少量均匀采样的锚点token保持区域保真度，实现高效推理。

Result: 在HART和Infinity模型中，SparseVAR实现了最高2倍的加速，且Infinity-2B的图像质量仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: SparseVAR通过动态排除低频token，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了图像生成的高质量，为视觉自回归模型提供了高效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

<details>

Motivation: 现有MIL方法未充分考虑病理症状和诊断类别的优先级问题，导致模型忽略类别间的优先级，影响临床决策。

Method: 采用垂直和水平两种层次结构，对齐MIL预测，并在训练中隐式重用特征以优先处理更严重的临床类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少误诊，并在多类场景中优先识别重要症状。

Conclusion: 新方法通过层次结构和特征重用，显著提升了临床MIL任务的优先级处理能力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Motivation: 少样本学习因数据稀缺面临挑战，现有方法仅对齐视觉表示和类别名称嵌入，忽略了视觉多样性。

Method: 提出多属性生成器（MPG）、LLM辅助检索和对比学习策略，生成视觉属性标记并优化表示学习。

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优异，验证了主导属性对分类性能的提升。

Conclusion: BCT-CLIP通过探索主导属性，显著提升了少样本学习的分类能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的户外重光照框架，通过本征图像分解精确整合阳光、天空辐射和间接光照，支持多样化的阴影效果和动态阴影生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将全局光照压缩为单一潜在向量，限制了光照效果的多样性和动态阴影的生成。

Method: 采用残差法提取阳光可见性、区域监督框架和光线追踪技术，实现物理可解释的光照分解和真实阴影模拟。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成新视角时具有高保真度，且光照和阴影效果更自然多样。

Conclusion: 该框架在户外重光照任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VParser提出了一种多视角语义表示方法，通过自适应分解标记实现文本与视频的精准对齐，解决了现有视频-文本匹配中的部分不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频内容比图像更丰富，而现有视频-文本数据集的描述仅反映部分内容，直接对齐文本与视频表示会导致错误监督。

Method: 引入自适应分解标记（Adaptive Decomposition Tokens），提取文本和视频的多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，T2VParser通过有效的跨模态内容分解，实现了精准的部分对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser在保留预训练模型知识的同时，解决了视频-文本匹配中的信息不对等问题。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

TL;DR: AgroBench是一个由农学家标注的基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在农业任务中的表现，涵盖7个农业主题、203种作物和682种病害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业任务的自动化理解对可持续作物生产至关重要，而VLMs通过文本交互有望扩展农业任务范围。

Method: 引入AgroBench基准，包含专家标注的广泛农业类别，用于评估VLMs的细粒度识别能力。

Result: VLMs在细粒度识别任务（如杂草识别）中表现不佳，接近随机水平。

Conclusion: AgroBench揭示了VLMs的不足，并为其未来发展提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

*Xun Liang,Xin Guo,Zhongming Jin,Weihang Pan,Penghui Shang,Deng Cai,Binbin Lin,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpatialVTS的方法，通过视觉和文本双重思维增强空间推理能力，显著提升了模型在空间理解任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）发展迅速，但在空间推理任务中表现仍不理想，因此需要一种新方法来提升其能力。

Method: SpatialVTS方法分为空间视觉思维和空间文本思维两阶段：前者生成与位置相关的特定标记，后者基于视觉线索和对话进行长期推理。同时改进了数据集标注和输入格式。

Result: 在不引入额外信息（如掩码或深度）的情况下，模型在多个空间理解任务中的平均表现显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS通过视觉和文本双重思维有效提升了空间推理能力，为VQA和机器人任务提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Motivation: 开发低成本、模块化的硬件平台，利用机器视觉技术提高绿扁豆分类的准确性和效率。

Method: 采用两阶段YOLOv8模型：检测模型定位豆子，分类模型将其分为六类；结合气动喷射和Arduino控制系统实现实时分离。

Result: 系统在59 mm/s的传送带速度下运行，分离准确率为87.2%，但处理速率较低（8克/分钟）。

Conclusion: 原型展示了机器视觉在谷物分选中的潜力，为未来改进提供了模块化基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic
grain classification system for green lentils (Lens Culinaris), which leverages
computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot是一个无需训练的多代理系统，通过多模态大语言模型协作，自动化提示词优化、模型选择和迭代生成，显著提升生成质量和文本-图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，用户需反复调整且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法可控性有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot包含三个代理：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，分别负责标准化输入、模型选择和生成、质量评估与反馈。

Result: 在开源模型上，T2I-Copilot的VQA分数接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%，性能提升6.17%。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作实现了高效、低成本的文本到图像生成，支持全自动和人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

TL;DR: 本文首次研究草图质量评估，提出Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL)方法，利用特征幅值作为质量指标，无需人工标注。GACL在草图与自然图像质量评估中均有效，并展示了其通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估问题，避免人工标注需求。

Method: 提出GACL方法，将特征幅值与可识别性学习作为双重任务，通过交叉熵分类损失优化。

Result: GACL与人类质量感知一致，并支持三种草图应用，且适用于自然图像质量评估。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用数据重加权策略，适用于多种问题，如噪声标签清理。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合心理学先验知识和统计AU模式的FED-PsyAU框架，通过分层学习面部运动特征提升微表情识别性能，并利用联邦学习解决数据隐私和小样本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临样本量小、特征细微及数据隐私问题，亟需一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 提出FED-PsyAU框架，结合心理学研究的面部动作单元协调先验和统计AU模式，开发DPK-GAT网络进行分层学习，并采用联邦学习实现多客户端隐私保护。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上的实验验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了识别性能。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架不仅提升了微表情识别性能，还通过联邦学习解决了隐私和小样本问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker提出了一种仅需音频输入即可生成逼真3D面部动画的方法，无需额外先验信息，提升了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外先验信息（如类别标签或3D面部网格），无法准确反映说话风格，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1）记忆通用动作；2）通过音频驱动的说话风格特征个性化合成面部动作。

Result: 实验表明，MemoryTalker在个性化面部动画生成上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker无需额外先验信息，即可生成高质量个性化3D面部动画，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致动画抖动和不自然。

Method: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失函数，通过引入音素协同发音权重，动态调整面部运动的重要性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在语音驱动的3D面部动画中显式建模语音上下文依赖的音素的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Result: 在NSLSR数据集上验证了算法的优越性，检测性能和图像融合效果显著提升。

Conclusion: LSFDNet通过多模态融合和任务交互，显著提升了复杂场景下的船舶检测能力。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

Motivation: 现有模型未充分利用MRI切片间的空间相关性，M-Net旨在填补这一空白，通过时序建模技术提升分割的连续性和准确性。

Method: M-Net引入Mesh-Cast机制整合时序信息，并采用TPS训练策略，分阶段学习序列通用模式和切片特定特征。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net是一种鲁棒的时序感知MRI肿瘤分割解决方案，兼具高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种轻量化深度学习算法用于遥感场景分类，但在资源受限的边缘设备上，模型精度、推理延迟和能耗之间的平衡仍具挑战性。

Method: 首先通过频域蒸馏减小GFNet模型尺寸，再设计动态提前退出机制以优化推理效率。

Conclusion: 提出的E3C框架在边缘设备上实现了性能与效率的优化，为遥感场景分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双路径架构DAMS，用于视频异常检测，结合多尺度时空特征和跨模态语义对齐，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测面临多尺度时间依赖性、视觉语义异质性和标注数据稀缺等挑战，需要一种高效的方法来整合多层次特征和互补信息。

Method: DAMS框架包含两条路径：主路径结合AMTPN和CBAM实现多尺度时间特征提取和注意力优化；并行路径利用CLIP进行跨模态语义对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中，DAMS表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS通过双路径互补和信息融合，构建了全面的异常事件表示和识别能力。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

TL;DR: TransPrune是一种无需训练的高效视觉语言模型（LVLM）令牌剪枝方法，通过令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）评估令牌重要性，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因视觉令牌数量庞大导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需探索新的令牌重要性评估方法。

Method: 提出TransPrune方法，结合令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）评估令牌重要性，逐步剪枝。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，TransPrune性能接近原始LVLMs（如LLaVA-v1.5和LLaVA-Next），同时减少超过一半的推理计算量（TFLOPs）。TTV单独使用时效果媲美基于注意力的方法。

Conclusion: TransPrune通过令牌转移变化和指令引导注意力高效剪枝，显著提升计算效率，为LVLMs的优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at
https://github.com/liaolea/TransPrune.

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上定量和定性评估，展示其在色彩映射调整和转移中的应用。

Conclusion: 方法有效恢复色彩映射，适用于多种场景，包括离散调色板和带图例的可视化。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该方法为多相机系统或复杂环境提供了一种简单且实用的姿态估计解决方案。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且鲁棒，无需预训练扩散模型，为跨域图像合成提供了新思路，并建立了基准数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: ICF和MIT有效解决了模态差异问题，CDCL进一步提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 实验表明，ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有PETL方法的性能，且无需额外推理成本。

Conclusion: ReSoRA是一种灵活且高效的方法，可无缝集成到现有PETL方法中，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对无人机多模态图像配准的基准数据集ATR-UMMIM，填补了该领域的空白，并支持实际场景下的多模态融合与感知研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏公开的多模态配准基准数据集，限制了无人机场景下先进配准方法的开发与评估。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建包含7,969组可见光、红外和配准图像的基准数据集，覆盖多样化场景和条件。

Result: 数据集提供高质量的像素级配准真值和丰富的成像条件属性，支持下游任务如目标检测。

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM将推动无人机多模态配准、融合与感知技术的发展，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

TL;DR: RRVF框架通过视觉反馈减少对图像-文本监督的依赖，提升MLLMs的视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在深度视觉推理中过度依赖图像-文本监督的问题。

Method: 提出RRVF框架，基于验证不对称性原则，通过推理、渲染和视觉反馈的闭环迭代过程，利用强化学习优化。

Result: 在图像到代码生成任务中，RRVF显著优于现有开源MLLMs和监督微调基线。

Conclusion: 纯视觉反馈驱动的系统为无需显式监督的更强健和通用推理模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available
at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

TL;DR: RingMo-Agent是一个多模态多平台遥感图像处理模型，通过用户文本指令执行感知和推理任务，解决了现有方法在异构数据源和复杂任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言研究依赖同质数据源，局限于分类或描述任务，无法统一处理多源异构数据。

Method: 1) 基于大规模RS-VL3M数据集；2) 学习模态自适应表示；3) 统一任务建模。

Result: 实验表明RingMo-Agent在视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现优异，且具有跨平台和模态的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为多源遥感数据提供了一个统一且独立的处理框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Motivation: 探讨合成数据是否能同时实现高准确性和公平性，以解决人脸识别系统中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Flux.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5生成平衡数据集FairFaceGen，结合多种身份增强方法，并与真实数据对比评估。

Result: 合成数据在IJB-B/C基准上表现稍逊，但SD35生成的平衡数据集在偏见缓解方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 合成数据在构建更公平的人脸识别系统方面具有潜力，但需优化增强方法以提高性能。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的森林高度估计对气候变化监测和碳循环评估至关重要，传统SAR方法依赖复杂预处理，而FGump通过简化流程提升效率。

Method: FGump采用梯度提升算法，利用多通道SAR数据和LiDAR地面真值，避免复杂预处理，仅需少量手工设计特征。

Result: FGump在分类和回归任务中表现优异，回归方法避免了量化误差，精度高于现有AI和经典方法，且训练和推理时间显著降低。

Conclusion: FGump为森林高度估计提供了高效且精确的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的进步，恶意行为者更容易伪造图像，这对KYC应用构成威胁，需要更强大的伪造检测系统。

Method: 创建FantasyID数据集，模拟真实ID卡设计，包含多样化的风格、语言和真实人脸，并模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有检测算法在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，误报率为10%时，漏报率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为伪造检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing

protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional

significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有评估方法未能真实反映CLIP在少样本下的归纳泛化能力，因多数数据集已被CLIP见过。

Method: 提出使用遗忘技术构建真实归纳基准，并改进少样本分类方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估问题，通过遗忘技术提供解决方案，并提出新基准和改进方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Conclusion: METEOR首次成功实现高效多编码器视觉语言模型，为多模态任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了交互式视频生成与编辑能力，为高级内容创作和动态场景理解开辟了新可能。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

Motivation: 无监督对象发现（UOD）缺乏标注数据，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出UnionCut（基于min-cut和集成方法的前景先验）和UnionSeg（高效蒸馏模型），用于准确识别前景并动态停止发现。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了更鲁棒和高效的前景先验，推动了无监督对象发现的发展。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像和视频去雪方法存在幻觉伪影和对高帧率的依赖，事件相机因其低延迟和高动态范围成为理想解决方案。

Result: 在PSNR上优于现有方法3 dB，且支持深度估计和光流任务，性能提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视觉系统在恶劣冬季条件下的可靠性，为全天候应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架，用于评估和改进模型在不同扫描仪下的性能一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算病理学中模型因扫描仪差异导致的性能不一致问题，确保模型在真实医疗场景中的可靠性。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个样本用5台扫描仪扫描），并提出SimCons框架，结合增强技术和一致性损失。

Result: SimCons提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: SCORPION和SimCons为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的重要工具，设定了可靠性测试的新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMLET-FFD是一个基于认知启发的多模态学习框架，通过双向跨模态推理解决人脸伪造检测中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展对检测方法提出了跨域泛化的挑战，传统方法难以学习域不变表示。

Method: HAMLET-FFD结合对比视觉语言模型（如CLIP），通过知识精炼循环和双向融合机制，逐步对齐视觉观察与语义先验。

Result: 实验表明HAMLET-FFD在多个基准测试中表现出优异的泛化能力，并能识别细粒度伪造特征。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了伪造检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

### [238] [RIS-LAD: A Benchmark and Model for Referring Low-Altitude Drone Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20920)
*Kai Ye,YingShi Luan,Zhudi Chen,Guangyue Meng,Pingyang Dai,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对低空无人机（LAD）场景的细粒度Referring Image Segmentation（RIS）基准数据集RIS-LAD，并设计了语义感知自适应推理网络（SAARN）来解决LAD场景中的独特挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低空无人机场景中的RIS研究尚未充分探索，现有方法难以应对其多样视角和高密度对象的特点。

Method: 提出SAARN网络，通过类别主导的语言增强（CDLE）和自适应推理融合模块（ARFM）动态处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN能有效解决这些问题。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了LAD场景RIS研究的空白，SAARN为复杂场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

### [239] [Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20934)
*Melissa Cote,Alexandra Branzan Albu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合生成式AI（T2I）的方法T2I-QBE，用于解决传统基于示例查询（QBE）在文档图像检索中的局限性，特别是在历史文档检索中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QBE方法需要用户提供查询示例，但实际中可能无法获取。ABDIR通过视觉属性描述文档，但缺乏灵活性。本文旨在利用生成式AI填补QBE与ABDIR之间的空白。

Method: 提出T2I-QBE方法，使用Leonardo.Ai生成基于文本提示的查询图像，结合ABDIR的视觉属性描述，再通过QBE范式进行检索。

Result: 在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的实验验证了T2I-QBE的可行性，表明生成式AI可用于文档图像检索。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是一种创新的文档图像检索方法，首次尝试将T2I生成技术应用于DIR领域，为历史文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video是一个多模态模型，用于端到端处理视频的视觉、音频和文本信号，支持多粒度时间戳视频标注、问答、时间定位和推理，显著提升用户参与度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，需要高效的多模态信息整合能力。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习和最终微调训练，利用高质量自动化标注数据，实现7B参数的紧凑设计。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现优异，支持零样本或少样本微调，实际部署显著提升用户参与度，推理时间仅10秒（1分钟视频）。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在短视频理解任务中表现出色，具备高效性和实用性，适用于多样化下游应用。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Motivation: 现有基于掩码的方法存在信息丢失、身份参考不一致以及负面影响的缺陷，需要改进。

Result: 在LRS2和HDTF数据集上验证了方法的有效性，无需掩码或身份参考图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了说话人脸生成的视觉质量和身份细节保留能力。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用时间信息，仅依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，无法有效利用全局序列信息。

Method: 提出GTAD网络，结合局部时间特征和全局时间特征，通过去噪网络实现全局时间信息聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现优越，提供了更连贯和全面的环境理解。

Conclusion: GTAD方法有效提升了动态环境感知能力，为3D场景理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Motivation: 现有基于锚点的多视图聚类方法在锚点结构设计上缺乏优化原则，忽视了核心结构需求。

Method: 将锚点聚类过程分解为RepresentModule、NoiseModule和AnchorModule三个模块，并通过展开优化步骤实现网络架构。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过优化驱动的模块化设计，显著提升了锚点多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural

both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Conclusion: 安全张量有效扩展了文本安全机制到视觉模态，填补了跨模态安全空白。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出EmoCap100K数据集和EmoCapCLIP框架，利用自然语言描述学习面部情感表示，解决了传统固定标签的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情感识别系统使用固定标签或抽象维度，无法捕捉情感的丰富性和细微差别，而自然语言提供了更灵活的表达方式。

Method: 引入EmoCap100K数据集（10万样本），并提出EmoCapCLIP框架，结合全局-局部对比学习和跨模态引导正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情感表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用自然语言描述学习面部情感表示具有潜力，EmoCapCLIP框架为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M，一个公开的大规模图像编辑数据集，通过改进现有数据集和微调开源模型，显著提升了指令引导图像编辑的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的专有性质限制了开源研究，作者希望通过公开数据集推动开放研究。

Method: 利用GPT-4o统一和优化三个流行图像编辑数据集，重新生成图像以提升质量，并重写提示以增强语义清晰度。

Result: 微调后的模型（如FluxKontext）在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著超越现有开源方法，接近专有模型性能。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动指令引导图像编辑领域的开源研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视角，将4D空间智能的重建方法分为五个渐进层次，并讨论了每层的关键挑战和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D空间智能重建是计算机视觉中的核心挑战，现有综述缺乏对其层次结构的全面分析。

Method: 将现有方法组织为五个层次：从低级的3D属性重建到高级的物理约束建模。

Result: 提出了一个层次化框架，并总结了每层的挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 论文填补了4D空间智能重建综述的空白，并提供了未来发展的方向。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date
project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜技术的快速发展产生了大量高分辨率结构数据，但传统方法在效率和可扩展性上存在局限，深度学习为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 通过卷积神经网络（如Topaz、crYOLO）实现自动颗粒挑选，利用AI工具（如spIsoNet、cryoPROS）解决取向偏好问题，并采用高级降噪算法（如Topaz-Denoise）。在cryoET中，使用U-Net架构（如IsoNet）进行缺失楔形校正和降噪。

Conclusion: 随着深度学习的进步，特别是大型语言模型和视觉变换器的应用，结构生物学将迎来更高效的自动化和更广泛的可及性，有望彻底改变对生物大分子结构和功能的理解。

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

### [253] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的中值滤波算法，通过分层分块减少冗余计算，实现了更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中值滤波计算成本高，尤其是大核尺寸时性能下降。

Method: 提出两种变体：基于寄存器操作的数据无关选择网络和基于随机存取内存的数据感知版本。

Result: 算法在CUDA实现中比现有技术快5倍，适用于多种数据尺寸和核大小。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了中值滤波的计算效率，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

Result: 实验表明，新方法在重建精度和鲁棒性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需硬件改动即可显著提升iToF系统的性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于从二维图像预测冰晶的三维微物理特性，包括有效密度、有效表面积和子弹数量，并通过合成数据验证了其高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰晶的微物理特性对云的辐射特性和地球气候有重要影响，但直接测量这些特性具有挑战性。因此，需要一种非侵入式的方法来预测这些特性。

Method: 通过3D建模软件生成合成冰晶，并利用机器学习模型从二维图像预测三维特性，包括有效密度、有效表面积和子弹数量。

Result: 机器学习模型在合成数据上表现出高准确性，单视角模型的R²值分别达到0.99和0.98，子弹数量的平衡准确率和F1分数为0.91。双视角模型进一步提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为从原位图像估计冰晶微物理特性提供了一种新方法，有助于改进微物理参数化模型。

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

Method: 提出ConSeg攻击方法，利用目标类与受害类的共现关系，通过重建上下文信息增强攻击效果。

Result: ConSeg攻击成功率比现有方法提高15.55%，且能抵抗先进防御手段。

Conclusion: ConSeg是一种简单有效的后门攻击方法，为语义分割模型的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation
models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden
triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class
as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the
reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks
against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg
leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models
to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing
observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of
the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building
upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class
and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship
between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our
experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate
(ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting
resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

Conclusion: ChartGen及其数据集有助于推动图表理解和视觉条件代码生成的研究。

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study

to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）的光谱连续性为自监督学习提供了独特机会，但目前尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SpecBPP框架，通过恢复打乱的光谱段顺序来学习全局光谱特征，并采用渐进式训练策略管理排列空间的复杂性。

Result: 在EnMAP卫星数据的土壤有机碳估计任务中，SpecBPP优于其他基线方法，R²为0.9456，RMSE为1.1053%，RPD为4.19。

Conclusion: 光谱顺序预测是高光谱理解的有效前置任务，为遥感及其他领域的科学表征学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific
representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.

Result: 混合方法AUC提升至79.6%，召回率80.5%，F1分数67.4%，优于单一方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法性能接近SOTA，且架构简单、计算高效，适合临床决策支持。

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based
embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline
(AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep
ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源CT扫描分类因域偏移问题导致跨源泛化性能下降，现有预处理方法虽有效但机制不明。

Method: 采用SSFL++和KDS预处理方法，通过空间和时间标准化减少源间差异，映射输入到一致目标空间。

Result: 实验证明该方法在不同架构中均提升性能，并在竞赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 输入空间标准化是解决多机构医学影像域偏移的实用方案。

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Result: 生成的图像质量接近真实图像，混合数据集显著提升分类和分割模型的性能（准确率和F1分数提高8%-15%）。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学影像数据挑战提供了可扩展解决方案，提升了罕见疾病诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

Result: 实验表明，DPSR在低功耗硬件上实现实时超分辨率，性能优于或媲美更复杂的现有方法。

Conclusion: DPSR是一种高效、轻量的星上实时超分辨率解决方案，适合星载高光谱图像处理。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures
essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of
limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable
preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities
offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is
a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of
satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can
be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural
network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the
pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by
line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit
previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and
computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the
ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,
on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved
images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are
significantly more complex.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

Conclusion: 该混合孪生框架为GNC系统的现实评估和验证提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 桁架结构的检查和维护成本高且危险，现有研究多关注故障检测或机器人平台设计，而自主导航研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用分析算法和深度学习模型（如PointNet、PointTransformerV3）对3D点云进行二进制分割，区分可导航表面与背景。

Result: 分析算法参数调整简单且性能接近深度学习模型，而深度学习模型（如PointTransformerV3）在分割精度上表现更优（mIoU约97%）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了分析和深度学习方法在复杂桁架环境中的潜力，为未来自主基础设施检查提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This
research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system
designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest

deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced

Conclusion: FedDPG在保持数据隐私的同时，提高了模型灵活性和效率，为联邦学习中的NLP任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Result: 在13个基准测试中表现优异，仅用一半工具使用预算即超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ARPO为LLM代理在动态环境中的对齐提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on

efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a

Result: 在多项任务中表现与或优于点积注意力，同时能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: EcoTransformer是一种高效且性能优越的Transformer变体，适用于能耗敏感场景。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应新政策或自定义政策时存在局限性，需解决多政策扩展和用户标准动态调整的挑战。

Method: 采用“先例”机制，结合批判-修订机制收集高质量先例，并利用两种策略进行稳健预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下优于现有方法，且对新政策具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于动态多政策场景。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

Motivation: 解决训练不稳定性问题，同时提升模型在代理任务中的能力，推动开源大语言模型的发展。

Method: 采用MuonClip优化器（含QK-clip技术）和多阶段后训练（包括大规模代理数据合成和联合强化学习）。

Result: K2在多个基准测试中表现优异，如Tau2-Bench（66.1）、ACEBench（76.5）等，尤其在软件工程和代理任务中领先。

Conclusion: Kimi K2是目前最强大的开源大语言模型之一，特别适合软件工程和代理任务，其模型检查点已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32
billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the
MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to
address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of
Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero
loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training
process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a
joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its
capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments.
  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking
models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on
Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on
SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in

Motivation: 探索角色设定对模型推理任务的影响，并解析模型中关键组件如何编码角色信息。

Method: 使用激活修补技术分析模型，重点关注MLP和MHA层对角色信息的处理。

Result: 早期MLP层不仅关注输入句法结构，还处理语义内容；中层MHA层利用这些信息生成输出，并发现某些注意力头对种族和肤色身份过度关注。

Conclusion: 角色信息通过早期MLP和中层MHA层影响模型输出，揭示了模型在处理身份相关任务时的潜在偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

TL;DR: 提出LoRA-PAR框架，通过双系统分区数据和参数，减少参数使用同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法未针对不同任务需求定制数据和参数，受“快与慢思考”启发，提出分区优化。

Method: 分类任务数据并分区参数，采用两阶段微调：SFT增强直觉，RL强化逻辑推理。

Result: 实验表明，两阶段微调在减少参数使用的同时匹配或超越现有PEFT基线。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，高效提升大模型性能。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在持续学习多任务时会出现灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化，影响其零样本能力。

Method: 提出梯度零空间投影（GNSP），结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失，避免干扰先前任务并保持嵌入空间结构。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，成功保持CLIP的模态间隙和跨模态检索能力。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了CLIP持续学习中的问题，保持了其零样本能力和嵌入空间稳定性。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Motivation: 现实场景中持续学习的计算资源受限问题，现有方法需重训练整个模型，计算成本高。

Method: CLoRA采用LoRA方法，仅调整少量参数并跨任务共享，减少计算需求。

Result: CLoRA性能与基线方法相当或更优，显著降低硬件需求。

Conclusion: CLoRA为资源受限环境提供了高效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Motivation: 稀疏正则化在信号处理中至关重要，但强稀疏惩罚通常不可微，与梯度优化器不兼容。

Method: 提出WEEP（Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty），基于弱凸包络框架，实现可微且平滑的稀疏正则化。

Result: WEEP在信号和图像去噪任务中优于L1范数和其他非凸稀疏正则化器。

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可行性之间的冲突，为稀疏正则化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I扩散模型常表现出性别偏见，尤其是职业与性别的刻板关联。现有方法依赖CLIP过滤或提示工程，效果有限且需模型特定调整。

Method: SAE Debias在特征空间中操作，无需重新训练或修改架构。利用预训练的k稀疏自编码器识别性别相关方向，并在推理时抑制这些方向。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）上验证，SAE Debias显著减少性别偏见，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias为构建社会责任的生成AI提供了可解释、模型无关的工具，支持公平的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过表示层操作补充现有优化器，有效促进任务间互补性，提升多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术虽能实现地标和古迹的3D重建，但对建筑风格和结构知识的沉浸式理解仍局限于静态图文对，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: 扩展语言嵌入3D高斯泼溅技术，提出多外观CLIP特征提取、不确定性地图引导优化、瞬态不确定性自编码器及后集成策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在开放词汇分割任务中优于现有方法，支持交互式漫游、建筑风格识别和3D场景编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为无约束照片集合的开放词汇场景理解提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Motivation: 现有方法难以生成与音乐节奏和用户定义舞蹈风格协调的高质量舞蹈视频，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用SMPL参数作为中介，结合新颖的音乐编码器MotionTune捕捉音频运动线索，确保生成的舞蹈与音乐节拍和表现力一致。

Result: ChoreoMuse在视频质量、节拍对齐、舞蹈多样性和风格一致性方面达到领先水平。

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse为多样音乐风格和舞者特性提供了强大的自动化编舞解决方案。

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了高参数效率、精细纹理重建和易于提取纹理网格，且基元数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 解耦几何与外观的高斯泼溅技术显著提升了效率与效果。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of
heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and
reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and
encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of
interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用链式思维（CoT）微调的开源大语言模型（LLMs）能高效、准确地从MRI/CT报告中提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征并分类风险，性能媲美GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取PCL特征耗时且难以大规模研究，需自动化工具支持。

Method: 基于GPT-4o生成的CoT数据微调LLaMA和DeepSeek模型，使用6,000份MRI/CT报告训练，评估285份人工标注报告。

Result: 微调后模型特征提取准确率显著提升（LLaMA 80%→97%，DeepSeek 79%→98%），风险分类F1分数接近GPT-4o（0.95-0.97），与放射科医生一致性高（Kappa≈0.89）。

Conclusion: CoT微调的开源LLMs可实现高效、准确的PCL表型分析，性能与GPT-4o相当。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

### [290] [PITA: Preference-Guided Inference-Time Alignment for LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20067)
*Sarat Chandra Bobbili,Ujwal Dinesha,Dheeraj Narasimha,Srinivas Shakkottai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，无需预训练奖励模型，实现了推理时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练奖励模型，可能不稳定且计算成本高，PITA旨在消除这一依赖。

Method: PITA学习一个小型偏好引导策略，通过随机搜索和迭代优化直接修改token概率。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种高效、无需奖励模型的推理时对齐方法。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在大型语言和推理模型（LLMs/LRMs）中常导致脆弱和不稳定的政策，引发虚假推理、欺骗性对齐等问题，缺乏统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过数学框架分析奖励函数到最优策略的映射稳定性，探讨非唯一最优动作的影响，并扩展到多奖励RL和熵正则化。

Result: 理论框架统一解释了多种失败现象，验证了熵正则化能恢复政策稳定性但增加随机性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更安全、可信的AI系统提供了理论基础，将政策稳定性分析从经验启发提升为原则性理论。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

evaluations on a curated benchmark demonstrate that SciToolAgent significantly
outperforms existing approaches. Case studies in protein engineering, chemical
reactivity prediction, chemical synthesis, and metal-organic framework
screening further demonstrate SciToolAgent's capability to automate complex
scientific workflows, making advanced research tools accessible to both experts

Motivation: 探讨AI代理在现实环境中的安全性，尤其是在受到攻击时是否能遵循部署政策。

Method: 通过大规模红队测试，收集180万次提示注入攻击，分析成功案例，构建ART基准并评估19种先进模型。

Result: 几乎所有代理在10-100次查询内都会违反政策，攻击在不同模型和任务间具有高转移性，且代理鲁棒性与模型规模、能力或计算资源无关。

Conclusion: 当前AI代理存在严重漏洞，需额外防御措施。通过发布ART基准，推动更严格的安全评估和更安全的代理部署。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Motivation: 高质量化学数据库是AI驱动化学研究的基础，但当前化学信息的多模态和风格多样性限制了自动提取的效率。

Method: 利用MLLM的强大推理能力理解复杂化学图形结构，将提取任务分解为子任务，并协调多个专用智能体解决。

Result: 在复杂化学反应图形的基准数据集上，F1分数达到80.8%，显著优于之前的35.6%。

Conclusion: 该系统是实现化学信息自动提取到结构化数据集的关键一步，将极大推动AI驱动的化学研究。

Abstract: To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical
databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information
from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is
currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical
information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model
(MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction.
We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态知识图谱中模态分布不平衡，现有方法忽视多模态数据的互补性。

Method: 提出MoCME框架，包含互补性模态知识融合模块和熵引导负采样机制。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCME通过利用互补性和动态负采样，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有硬重置方法导致信息丢失，而软重置方法对神经元处理过于统一，因此需要一种更灵活的重置方式。

Method: 设计自适应重置神经元，建立输入、输出与重置的关联，并集成阈值调整策略。

Result: 在多种数据集上表现优异，同时保持了低能耗优势。

Conclusion: 自适应重置神经元有效解决了信息丢失和统一处理问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

Motivation: 当前AI领域竞争激烈，大型语言模型（LLMs）不断进步，但许多研究未充分利用这些进展。本研究旨在通过模型替换提升推荐系统性能。

Method: 在LlamaRec框架中用Llama3替换Llama2，设置相同随机种子和输入数据以确保公平比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，ML-100K、Beauty和Games数据集的性能平均提升了38.65%、8.69%和8.19%。

Conclusion: 模型替换是一种低成本高效的方法，无需系统结构改动即可显著提升推荐质量，适用于当前推荐系统的性能优化。

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

Motivation: LLMs在金融领域的应用中，预训练知识与实时市场数据之间的冲突可能导致不可靠的投资建议，但目前缺乏对LLMs实际投资观点的研究。

Method: 提出实验框架，通过假设情景（平衡与非平衡论点）提取模型的潜在偏好并测量其坚持程度，重点关注行业、规模和动量因素。

Result: 分析显示，大多数模型对大市值股票和逆向策略有持续偏好，且容易形成确认偏误，即使面对反证也固守初始判断。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在金融投资分析中的潜在偏见，强调了在部署前需评估和调整模型偏好的重要性。

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

Motivation: 探讨AI建议如何影响人们对自私行为的感知与惩罚，以及责任分配。

Method: 结合社会心理学理论与行为经济学方法，通过预注册、经济激励实验，评估决策者在不同建议（AI、人类或无建议）下的惩罚与责任分配。

Result: 自私行为受更严厉惩罚，而建议内容（自私或亲社会）影响惩罚程度；责任分配上，AI建议下决策者被认为更负责，但惩罚无差异。

Conclusion: 行为内容和建议类型是惩罚的主要决定因素，建议来源不影响惩罚力度。

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural
language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously
overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying
their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case
studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral
7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of
cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

Motivation: 仇恨模因通过修改文本或图像逃避检测，现有模型对此缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 结合四种文本攻击和三种图像损坏，测试两种检测器（MemeCLIP和MemeBLIP2），并引入TDA增强MemeBLIP2。

Result: MemeBLIP2对文本攻击敏感，但TDA使其成为最鲁棒的模型；所有系统依赖文本，但架构和预训练数据影响鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 轻量级模块（如TDA）是提升多模态安全模型防御能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

Method: 在三个APR基准（QuixBugs、Defects4J、HumanEval-Java）上评估六种LLMs（如CodeGen、CodeLlama-2），比较无微调、完全微调和PEFT（LoRA和IA3）的效果。

Result: 完全微调因数据分布差异和过拟合导致性能下降，而PEFT通过限制可训练参数取得更好结果。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调（PEFT）是提升LLMs在APR中性能的更优选择。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法难以有效利用未显式导入的内部API信息，影响了代码补全的准确性。

Method: 通过构建API的使用示例和语义描述扩展其表示，建立知识库供LLMs生成补全代码，并开发了ProjBench基准测试。

Result: 在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval上的实验表明，该方法在代码和标识符的精确匹配上分别提升了22.72%和18.31%，与现有基线结合后提升更显著。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了代码补全的准确性，尤其在处理未显式导入的API时表现突出。

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.
