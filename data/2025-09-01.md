### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBA是一种反偏见数据增强框架，通过在语义三元组层面修改文本来破坏虚假相关性，提高模型泛化能力和抗偏见性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致性能下降和泛化能力差，需要一种能同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性的方法

Method: 提出CoBA框架：将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，选择性修改这些三元组来破坏虚假相关性，然后重构文本生成反偏见数据

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅能提升下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对虚假相关性带来的挑战

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个大规模德语毒性言论数据集，包含平台提供的年龄估计，揭示了不同年龄段用户的毒性言论模式差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄段在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集并标注了Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的评论，包含3,024条人工标注和30,024条LLM标注的匿名评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人类专家和最先进语言模型的标注流程

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年龄相关的毒性言论模式差异：年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更多参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中的认知偏差（特别是锚定效应）对其在现实应用中的可靠性影响

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理进行价格谈判实验，应用锚定效应，并采用客观和主观指标评估谈判结果

Result: LLMs像人类一样受到锚定效应影响；推理模型较不容易受锚定效应影响；人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLMs中的认知偏差，推动LLMs在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基础视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着问题复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现出色，但缺乏对基础视觉感知能力的系统评估，需要测试模型在简单形状和结构图像上的基本感知能力

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在问题复杂度增加时性能显著下降，不同模型在各类别上表现出相似的趋势，某些认知技能比其他技能更难

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在基础视觉感知任务上存在明显局限，需要进一步改进模型的基本视觉理解能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个以数据为中心的视角，将科学大语言模型(Sci-LLMs)的发展重新定义为模型与其底层数据基质的共同进化，并系统分析了科学数据的独特挑战和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学大语言模型在科学研究中正在改变知识的表示、整合和应用方式，但其发展受到科学数据复杂性的制约。需要从数据角度重新审视Sci-LLMs的发展路径。

Method: 采用数据中心的综合分析方法，构建统一的科学数据分类法和科学知识层次模型，系统回顾了270多个预训练/后训练数据集和190多个基准数据集，分析科学数据的多模态、跨尺度和领域特定挑战。

Result: 识别出科学数据具有异质性、多尺度、不确定性等独特需求，需要保持领域不变性并支持跨模态推理的表征。评估方法正从静态考试转向过程和发现导向的评估。

Conclusion: 提出了向闭环系统的范式转变，基于Sci-LLMs的自主代理可以主动实验、验证并为活生生的、不断演进的知识库做出贡献，为构建可信赖的、持续演进的人工智能系统提供了路线图。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在评估时会受到模型标签偏见影响，Claude标签会提高评分而Gemini标签会降低评分，错误标签甚至能逆转排名，需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，但它们的判断可能会受到偏见影响，本研究旨在检验自评和跨模型评估中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在四种标签条件下（无标签、真实标签、两种错误标签）评估各自生成的博客文章，采用整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分。

Result: 结果显示明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提高分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数，错误标签经常逆转排名，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM框架通过贝叶斯实验设计提升大语言模型的信息收集能力，使其能够智能地选择最大化信息增益的问题，在多轮对话中显著优于直接提示和其他自适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或外部源收集信息，解决传统方法在信息收集效率上的不足。

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题；使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型；设计专门的EIG估计器；不依赖上下文更新；采用有针对性的候选查询策略。

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，BED-LLM相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互，在信息收集任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习优化Llama-3.1 8B模型，实现航空事故人因分析的自动化分类，性能显著提升，超越主流大模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS人因分析方法存在可扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提升航空安全分析效率

Method: 采用强化学习与GRPO算法微调Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成解决类别不平衡

Result: 精确匹配准确率提升350%（0.04→0.18），部分匹配准确率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-fiash

Conclusion: 领域优化的较小模型可为关键安全分析提供计算效率更高、性能更好的解决方案，适合资源受限设备部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来替代文本嵌入，有效防御多语言字符的拼写攻击，提升模型鲁棒性和多语言兼容性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母拼写攻击，导致性能显著下降，主要源于子词分词器的词汇表外问题

Method: 使用像素表示替代文本嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，构建基于像素的生成语言模型

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中表现出对拼写噪声的强大鲁棒性和多语言环境下的有效性

Conclusion: 像素表示方法为解决语言模型的拼写攻击脆弱性提供了有效解决方案，同时扩展了多语言文本处理能力

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型并未显示出明显的CP效应，反而延迟L2暴露会提升L2表现，延迟L1暴露会导致L1遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前研究在文本语言模型中探讨了关键期效应，但语音模型中的这些效应仍未充分探索，而口语在人类语言习得中具有核心作用。

Method: 在儿童导向语音上训练具有不同L2训练起始时间和L1训练结束时间的自监督语音模型，并评估其音素辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型没有显示出关键期效应的明确证据。延迟L2暴露起始的模型在L2上表现更好，延迟L1暴露结束会导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在音系习得方面不表现出人类语言习得中的典型关键期效应，这与人类学习模式存在差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法在句子级生成上表现不佳，自一致性方法计算成本高，存在冗余的共享前缀token

Method: 识别自一致性方法中的冗余（共享前缀token），提出解码记忆管道（DMP），包含选择性推理和退火解码

Result: 实验显示方法实现最高3倍加速，且AUROC性能没有损失

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Method: 使用在文本和代码上预训练的自回归主干网络，通过最后标记池化技术生成嵌入向量

Result: 尽管模型规模相对较小，但在代码嵌入任务上实现了最先进的性能表现

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to
retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical
question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across
programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone
pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token
pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this
approach to code embedding model construction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's
closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a
large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we
showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned
reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore
LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to
healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited
for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and
decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and
best practices.

TL;DR: 本文通过'正常性'概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是正常/平均而非卓越的人类智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。同时指出图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官评判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新解读图灵测试，通过统计学意义上的'正常性'概念来理解图灵测试的本质和局限性，特别是针对当前大型语言模型的发展。

Method: 概念分析和理论论证，基于统计学中的正态分布概念，对图灵测试的评判标准和机制进行重新阐释。

Result: 提出图灵测试是测试正常智能而非卓越智能，ChatGPT等模型追求的是人工聪明而非真正的人工智能。人类心智是否可简化为平均心智是核心问题。

Conclusion: 图灵测试无法真正检验人类认知，关键在于人类心智是否可被简化为统计意义上的平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身的范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 调查自动文本摘要评估中的可复现性挑战，揭示现有评估指标在实际应用中的真实表现与文献报告之间的差距。

Method: 构建统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上测试六种代表性评估指标（从经典ROUGE到最新LLM方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex），进行公平透明的比较分析。

Result: 发现评估指标存在结构性权衡：与人类判断最一致的指标往往计算密集且运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限的可复现性等问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越多地被用作完全自动的评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审技能方面的具体能力和局限性，以确保科学诚信。

Method: 提出了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下隔离和测试自动评审生成器检测研究逻辑缺陷的能力，测试了多种ARG方法。

Result: 研究发现，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对自动评审生成器的输出评论没有显著影响，表明当前模型无法有效检测研究逻辑问题。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了三个可操作的建议供未来工作参考，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

TL;DR: Med-RewardBench是首个专门评估医疗奖励模型和评判器的基准测试，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医疗案例，涵盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个临床关键维度上评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中潜力巨大，但需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应。目前缺乏专门针对医疗场景的奖励模型和评判器基准，现有基准主要关注通用能力，忽略了诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度。

Method: 构建Med-RewardBench基准，包含多模态数据集，采用三步严格流程确保高质量评估数据。评估32个最先进的多模态大语言模型，包括开源、专有和医疗专用模型，并开发基线模型通过微调提升性能。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在与专家判断对齐方面面临重大挑战，但开发的基线模型通过微调实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗AI系统的可靠性和安全性提供了重要基准，展示了微调在提升医疗模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，用于从大语言模型的词嵌入中分解出可解释的细粒度语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义组织更细致结构的方法。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，有助于理解语言和大脑中意义组织的精细结构，为概念语义研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)的意识形态深度，发现不同模型在政治立场稳定性和可操控性方面存在显著差异，并通过稀疏自编码器揭示了模型内部政治特征的分布规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面层面的回应往往可以通过简单的提示工程来操控，这让人质疑它们是否反映了连贯的潜在意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：首先通过指令提示和激活导向测量两个知名开源LLMs的可操控性；其次使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测这些模型的内部机制。

Result: 研究发现某些模型可以轻松在自由派和保守派观点之间切换，而其他模型表现出抵抗或拒绝率增加。意识形态"深度"模型比相似大小的模型多包含7.3倍的政治特征，对其核心政治特征进行针对性消融会导致相关主题推理的一致逻辑转变。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操控性为了解其潜在政治架构提供了有价值的窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种AI驱动的奖励策略来激发7B参数小语言模型的创意写作能力，通过RLAIF框架显著提升中文问候语生成质量，其中基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然创意写作能力强但计算需求大，小语言模型是替代方案但现有方法存在新颖性不足或成本高的问题，需要更有效的创意激发方法

Method: 在RLAIF框架下探索两种AI奖励策略：1）使用多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2）采用对抗训练优化的原则引导LLM-as-a-Judge直接提供奖励信号

Result: 两种方法都显著超越基线，但原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法生成质量更优，训练效率更高，减少对人类标注数据的依赖，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致

Conclusion: 基于原则的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，是激发SLM创意写作能力的优选方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，实验使用了40个异构分类器和来自不同应用领域的数据集

Conclusion: 提出的HierarchySelect方法能够有效选择多样化的分类器构建集成模型，在假新闻检测任务中表现出色，优于Elbow启发式方法和现有最先进基线

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the
specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review
evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同演化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Conclusion: 人格基础的分析能够揭示传统评估方法忽略的LLM差异，对于个性化模型选择具有重要意义。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

*Peng Yu,En Xu,Bin Chen,Haibiao Chen,Yinfei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QZhou-Embedding是基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的通用文本嵌入模型，采用多任务框架和专门的数据转换策略，在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量多样化数据提升检索模型性能。

Method: 使用统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略。采用数据合成管道（LLM API生成释义、增强和困难负样本），以及两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Result: 在MTEB和CMTEB基准测试中排名第一（2025年8月27日），同时在重排序、聚类等任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 高质量多样化数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM生成能力可以进一步优化数据质量，实现嵌入模型的突破。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Misviz基准数据集，包含2,604个带有12种误导类型的真实可视化图表，以及81,814个合成图表数据集Misviz-synth，用于训练和评估误导可视化检测模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化的公开数据集

Method: 创建真实世界可视化数据集Misviz（2,604个图表）和合成数据集Misviz-synth（81,814个图表），使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，检测误导性可视化存在困难

Conclusion: 发布Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为检测误导性可视化和识别违反的设计规则提供资源，帮助保护读者并减少错误信息传播

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

*Yao Wang,Di Liang,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CPI-FT框架，通过核心参数隔离和融合技术解决多任务微调中的跷跷板现象和灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在适应大语言模型时存在跷跷板现象，即某些任务性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价

Method: 1) 独立微调识别核心参数区域 2) 基于区域重叠的任务聚类 3) 核心参数移植+非核心参数SLERP融合 4) 轻量级流水线SFT训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著减轻任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于传统多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架有效解决了多任务微调中的性能权衡问题，为LLM下游任务适应提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务的概念，针对需要从文本中推导细微数值属性的问题。作者建立了RiR基准测试，发现现有方法效果不佳，进而提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，取得了65%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中推导出细微的数值属性，但现有的冻结LLM提示方法和Transformer编码器微调方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，该方法结合了批量反射提示优化(batch-reflective prompt optimization)和神经集成学习(neural ensemble learning)，是一个简单轻量级的解决方案。

Result: MENTAT方法在三个现实问题的RiR基准测试中取得了高达65%的性能提升，显著优于冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调两种基线方法。

Conclusion: 虽然MENTAT方法在RiR任务上取得了显著改进，但推理密集型回归任务仍有很大的提升空间，需要未来的进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的评分方法，通过联合对数似然评估推理链和最终答案，在数学推理任务中显著优于现有方法，使用更少样本获得更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的关键挑战。

Method: 提出概率置信选择与排序(PiCSAR)，使用推理过程和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分候选生成结果，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著提升(MATH500 +10.18, AIME2025 +9.81)，在20次比较中16次以至少2倍少的样本优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Motivation: 开发自动化牙齿状况分类系统，提高牙科诊断效率和准确性，减轻专家工作负担

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像和11,137个专家标注，评估三种方法：自定义CNN、CNN特征提取+传统分类器的混合模型、微调预训练模型，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型表现最佳（85.4%准确率），VGG16预训练模型次之（82.3%），自定义CNN基线为74.3%

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的实用路径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align通过创新的Query-Query对齐机制有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的加速缓存框架，通过分析缓存累积误差并联合修正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差，实现2倍推理加速同时保持或提升视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，特征缓存虽能加速但简单重用会导致明显的质量下降，需要解决缓存引入的累积误差问题

Method: 采用离线残差分析识别可重用步骤，通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔，使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差，联合修正特征偏移和步长放大误差

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现2倍推理加速，视觉质量保持甚至提升，在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上实现2倍加速且VBench退化最小

Conclusion: ERTACache提供了一个原则性的缓存框架，能够在大幅加速扩散模型推理的同时保持生成质量，为高效扩散模型采样提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: TVS是一种新的视频预处理任务，通过保留关键视频片段、同步重构查询并保持答案一致性，来改善视频大语言模型的时序语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型由于稀疏帧采样和训练中缺乏帧间推理监督，难以捕捉细粒度时序语义，而人类自然具备时间筛选能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Visual Screening (TVS)任务，包含三个步骤：保留焦点关键视频片段、同步重构查询到最直接形式、保持答案不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器任务，可无缝集成到视频指令调优和视频问答流程中。

Result: 提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频修剪任务上F-1分数比先前方法提高0.47，查询重写性能具有竞争力。实验显示TVS带来7.33%（训练）和34.6%（推理）的相对增益。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负载分配，有效提升了视频语言理解能力，证明了时序信息筛选的重要性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，用于减少文本到图像生成模型中的不安全内容生成，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件向锁定模型注入安全控制信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型安全机制容易受到分布偏移的规避攻击，或者需要大量模型特定调整，存在局限性。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并。

Result: 在6个不同的T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降低到7%，而基线方法约为20%，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control显著优于7种最先进的安全机制，在减少不安全内容生成方面表现优异，且具有即插即用的适应性。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Method: 提出GENNAV方法，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Conclusion: GENNAV有效解决了stuff-type目标区域识别难题，在复杂真实环境中展现出强大的性能，为移动设备的导航任务提供了可靠的视觉语言理解解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

*Jie Jiang,Qi Yang,Bolin Ni,Shiming Xiang,Han Hu,Houwen Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时也会进行冗余的逐步思考过程，导致计算效率低下。需要一种能够根据问题复杂度自适应决定是否思考的模型。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练方法，使模型同时具备思考和非思考能力，并通过双模式策略优化(BPO)提高模型判断是否激活思考过程的准确性。训练分为两个阶段：首先在精心策划的数据集上训练，然后在改进的GRPO框架下进行策略优化。

Result: R-4B在25个具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务中优于Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上以更低的计算成本实现了与Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506(16B)相当的性能。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型在处理简单问题时的计算冗余问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiddenObject是一个基于Mamba的多模态融合框架，整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，用于检测遮挡或伪装目标，在多个基准数据集上达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来检测隐藏或部分遮蔽的物体。

Method: 提出HiddenObject融合框架，使用基于Mamba的融合机制整合RGB、热成像和深度数据，捕获跨模态的互补信号，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能够显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

TL;DR: RadGS-Reg是一个新颖的框架，通过联合3D辐射高斯重建和3D/3D配准，实现椎体级别的CT/X射线配准，解决了传统方法的空间信息丢失和领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统"渲染和比较"方法在CT/X射线配准中存在空间信息丢失和领域差距问题，而现有的双平面X射线3D重建方法受限于密集视图要求和噪声X射线处理困难。

Method: 提出RadGS-Reg框架，包含双平面X射线椎体辐射高斯重建模块，采用基于学习的辐射高斯重建方法和反事实注意力学习机制，专注于噪声X射线中的椎体区域，并使用患者特定的预训练策略从模拟数据逐步适应到真实数据。

Result: 在内部数据集上的实验表明，该方法在两个任务上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合3D重建和配准，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动该领域发展。

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中提取，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含超过620万个合成3D建筑，提供三种模态的数据表示和详细的语义标注，数据集和代码样本已公开。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D为开发新颖的生成式AI算法提供了重要资源，能够自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义几何一致性，推动3D建筑建模领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变会影响单应性估计的准确性。传统方法分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：单图像畸变、两图像相同畸变和两图像独立畸变。基于此方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在所有三种情况下，提出的求解器比现有最先进方法更快，同时保持相似的精度。在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了统一的解决方案，开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都有显著改进，适用于各种计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致问题，提高神经网络概念解释的可靠性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来保证概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的GCAV，并提出了TGCAV测试方法来评估GCAV表示的效果。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致问题，增强了概念定位能力并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解框架，提高了概念激活向量的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，利用LLM从少量样本中推断语义身份规则，指导视觉基础模型提取身份判别特征，实现跨类别对象重识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对象重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练特定模型，缺乏泛化能力且标注成本高。自监督学习难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合LLM和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从正负样本对推断语义身份规则，生成动态视觉提示指导VFM（如DINO）提取身份判别特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过语义概念对齐实现了跨类别对象重识别，无需数据集特定的重新训练，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 本研究使用SegResNet模型在Auto3DSeg架构下，针对2025 PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务进行评估。在T1加权动脉期增强MRI任务上获得DSC 0.56，在T2加权MR-Linac任务上性能下降至DSC 0.33，显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断、治疗规划和预后评估至关重要，但由于解剖结构变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用SegResNet模型作为Auto3DSeg架构的一部分，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，重点关注解剖相关感兴趣区域。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉期增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac病例。

Result: 任务1：DSC 0.56，5mm DSC 0.73，HD95 41.1mm，MASD 26.0mm，RMSE 5164mm；任务2：DSC 0.33，5mm DSC 0.50，HD95 20.1mm，MASD 7.2mm，RMSE 17203mm。任务2性能明显下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示了小数据集下MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，不同MRI序列会引入变异性。尽管性能一般，但展示了自动化分割的潜力，强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反演推断底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型难以在不同成像序列间泛化，因为图像对比度差异巨大。虽然成像协议不同，但所有图像都由相同的自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）控制，这为解决泛化问题提供了物理基础。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）通过求解非线性逆问题从观测图像反演推断底层自旋属性；2）使用扩散模型从mSASHA数据集学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）基于估计的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MR图像获得有意义的自旋属性估计，作为可解释的潜在变量，实现高度灵活的图像合成。实验表明Reverse Imaging能够在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，实现了宽谱泛化的心脏MRI分割。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性设计，依赖2D约束优化姿态但牺牲3D准确性，无法同时考虑个性化身体形状和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现形状条件3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代引导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还显著改善了绝对姿态精度，且仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效减少对2D约束的过度依赖，提供了一种数据高效且可扩展的个性化3D人体姿态恢复解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真3D人体姿态方面表现出色，但其迭代性质和多重假设需求导致计算成本高昂，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 采用分层时间剪枝(HTP)策略：1)时间相关性增强剪枝(TCEP)通过自适应时间图构建分析帧间运动相关性识别关键帧；2)稀疏聚焦时间多头自注意力(SFT MHSA)利用帧级稀疏性减少注意力计算；3)掩码引导姿态标记剪枝器(MGPTP)通过聚类进行细粒度语义剪枝。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP将训练MACs减少38.5%，推理MACs减少56.8%，推理速度平均提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的分层时间剪枝策略有效解决了扩散模型在3D人体姿态估计中的计算效率问题，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

TL;DR: 发布了首个妇科腹腔镜子宫内膜异位症数据集GLENDA，包含区域标注，用于支持计算机视觉和机器学习在手术视频分析中的应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 妇科腹腔镜手术视频的手动分析耗时且繁琐，而现有计算机视觉方法需要大量样本数据，但在医疗领域数据稀缺

Method: 与领先医学专家合作创建了包含子宫内膜异位症区域标注的图像数据集GLENDA

Result: 成功构建了首个此类数据集，为手术视频分析提供了宝贵的训练数据资源

Conclusion: GLENDA数据集的发布将促进妇科腹腔镜手术视频分析的自动化方法发展，支持治疗规划、病例记录和教育等术后活动

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用区域全卷积网络对腹腔镜妇科手术视频中的手术器械进行实例分割和识别，实现了较高的器械定位和分割精度，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索基础）由于特殊的视频内容而面临巨大挑战。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割（二值分割）和(2)器械识别（多类别识别）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量较少，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域；但由于手术器械内在高度相似性，确定具体器械类型仍然非常困难。

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但器械类型识别仍需进一步研究改进，特别是在处理高度相似器械方面。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏WSI内容的标准元数据标准，大规模WSI集合的手动检查和选择效率低下，影响AI算法发展。

Method: 提出一种通用框架，通过三层组织结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）为每个WSI生成详细的组织地图，使用统一语法语义实现不同目录间的互操性。

Result: 在临床病理学领域实现并验证了该方法，通过WSI目录、机器学习和图象表示等具体应用案例展示了其优势和适用性。

Conclusion: 该标准化框架有效解决了WSI内容元数据缺头问题，为大规模AI算法开发提供了重要支撑，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型增量学习新知识。现有类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法获得竞争性结果，比最先进的class-iNCD方法准确率高出5%以上

Conclusion: ICPL方法在细粒度数据集上展示实际应用价值，计算复杂度验证了其在资源受限环境中的适用性，为无监督增量学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Motivation: 合成医疗数据虽然可扩展性强，但存在显著的域差距，限制了其在真实临床环境中的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表示等方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类条件生成模型。学习共享的域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任意域对之间的无缝转换。引入X-DigiSkull数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管模型规模比基于扩散的方法小，MedShift仍表现出强大的性能，在推理时具有灵活性，可以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Result: 在大量实验中证明M框架在保持优越视觉质量的同时，显著减少了训练时间

Conclusion: M框架为动态场景的高斯泼溅提供了一种可扩展的高效解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面优于现有方法

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia

underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么只关注单一技术家族，要么在特定类型的OOD数据集上评估效果，忽视了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一了最先进的OOD检测器，结合特征截断技术和多种评分函数的聚合。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于现有方法，在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 特征截断和评分函数的有效结合，以及多个评分函数的聚合，能够显著提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对遥感图像船舶检测的局部增强方法，通过仅对目标区域进行增强来避免背景干扰，提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率和迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于数据变换的方法在增强对抗样本迁移性时，过度增强图像背景或无关区域可能引入不必要的干扰，导致目标检测模型出现误检，这些错误并非由对抗补丁本身引起，而是由于背景和非目标区域的过度增强造成的。

Method: 提出局部增强方法，仅对目标区域应用增强，避免对非目标区域产生影响。通过减少背景干扰，使损失函数更直接地关注对抗补丁对检测模型的影响。

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率，并增强了其迁移性。

Conclusion: 局部增强方法能够有效提升对抗补丁攻击的效果，通过专注于目标区域避免了背景干扰问题，为遥感图像船舶检测的安全性提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，专门研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加，并通过位置编码和DPO策略显著减少了27.7%的SAH比率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉。之前的基准主要关注短视频，而长视频中由于多个事件的语义复杂性增加，语义聚合幻觉(SAH)变得尤为关键，需要专门研究。

Method: 引入ELV-Halluc基准系统研究SAH；通过实验确认SAH存在并分析其特性；采用位置编码策略和DPO（直接偏好优化）策略来缓解SAH；构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实SAH确实存在且随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化的语义上更容易产生SAH；位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；DPO策略显著改善了模型区分事件内和事件间语义的能力，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 长视频中的语义聚合幻觉是一个重要但被忽视的问题，ELV-Halluc基准为系统研究SAH提供了有效工具。通过位置编码和DPO策略可以有效缓解SAH，为提升视频多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 训练卷积神经网络来上采样低分辨率的基础模型特征，以处理显微镜图像中的精细特征和大尺寸图像问题，提高分割效率和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型的特征描述符通常是基于补丁的，难以表示显微图像中的精细特征，且处理大尺寸图像时效率低下

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率基础模型特征进行上采样，然后应用于各种显微图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割比传统卷积网络更快、需要更少的标签就能产生高质量分割

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理显微图像中的精细特征和大尺寸问题，显著提高了分割效率和质量

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

TL;DR: HCCM框架通过区域-全局图像文本对比学习和匹配学习，解决了无人机场景中视觉语言理解的细粒度语义和动态环境挑战，在图像和文本检索任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中的宽视场和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解构成挑战，主流VLM缺乏细粒度语义，现有分层方法依赖精确实体分割和严格包含关系，在动态环境中效果有限。

Method: 提出HCCM框架：1）RG-ITC通过对比局部视觉区域与全局文本来捕获分层局部到全局语义；2）RG-ITM评估全局跨模态表示中的局部语义一致性；3）MCD机制提高对不完整文本描述的鲁棒性。

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%的图像检索Recall@1和14.7%的文本检索Recall@1；在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线。

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，在不依赖精确场景分割和严格约束的情况下，实现了优异的检索性能和零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的单图像3D高斯泼溅重建方法，能够从单张图像生成完整的3D场景（包括遮挡部分），解决了传统方法在遮挡区域重建时的模糊性和单一性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要密集的场景观测，无法重建遮挡和未观测区域，且回归式方法只能预测单一模式，导致结果模糊、不真实，无法捕捉多种可能的解释。

Method: 使用变分自重构器（Variational AutoReconstructor）从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后在该潜在空间上训练扩散模型，以生成基于单张输入图像的3D高斯泼溅表示分布。

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建结果和多样化样本，成功完成遮挡表面的重建，实现高质量的360度渲染。

Conclusion: 通过生成式方法解决了单图像3D重建中的遮挡和未观测区域问题，避免了传统回归方法的局限性，实现了更完整和真实的3D场景重建。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较虽然比绝对评分更可靠，但需要O(n²)次标注，计算成本过高。需要更高效的标注方法

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行零样本层次预排序 2) 初始化桶感知Elo分数 3) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同归并排序，用自动化比较替代明显的人类比较

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计(FGNET)、历史图像年代学(DHCI)、视网膜图像质量评估(EyePACS)。标注成本比穷举成对比较减少90.5%，比现有方法减少19.8%(n=100时)，同时保持或提高了评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Conclusion: 该方法首次提出了从最小观察中统一恢复三种模态的框架，为可穿戴设备的人-物交互建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景上预训练，但其在城市领域中的细粒度空间推理能力（物体、布局和深度线索）尚未得到充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用街景图像的分割、深度和物体检测预测构建合成VQA数据集，每个问题都配有LLM生成的链式思维答案用于逐步推理监督，然后对三种VLMs进行零样本评估和微调效果比较。

Result: 结果显示，虽然VLMs在零样本设置下表现合理，但使用合成的CoT监督数据集进行微调可大幅提升性能，特别是在否定和反事实等挑战性问题类型上。

Conclusion: 本研究将城市空间推理确立为VLMs的新挑战，并证明合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的实用途径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越了自然影像的时空方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育追踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类/回归任务，限制了细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，这是一种生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能退化为最近图像预测器。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM consistently超越了自然影像领域的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM成功解决了医学影像时间动态建模的根本性差距，提供了一个统一的生成框架，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，为4D医学图像预测领域设立了新的标准。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多模态深度学习框架，整合术前CT和术后病理切片图像来预测透明细胞肾癌的复发风险，发现病理图像模型优于CT模型，中间融合策略性能最佳，接近临床基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leibovich评分在透明细胞肾癌复发风险评估中应用广泛，但存在患者层面分辨率有限且缺乏影像信息的局限性，需要开发整合多模态信息的个性化预测方法。

Method: 采用模块化深度学习框架，使用预训练编码器和基于Cox的生存模型，测试了单模态、晚期融合和中间融合三种设置，在真实世界ccRCC队列中进行评估。

Result: 病理图像模型始终优于CT模型，中间融合进一步改善性能，最佳模型(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18)接近调整后的Leibovich评分，放射学通过融合增加价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基于基础模型的多模态整合在个性化ccRCC风险预测中的可行性，未来需要探索更具表达力的融合策略、更大的多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN方法在保持物理可解释性的同时，有效解决了计算机生成全息术中的非线性不适定问题，实现了优异的重建性能。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度分数有效提高了HD地图构建的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在困难场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现对抗性扰动会在CNN激活层中产生可检测的熵特征，无需修改模型即可实现90%的检测准确率，误报率和漏报率均低于20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性攻击检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的性能，因此需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方法。

Method: 通过在VGG-16上并行监控激活熵，发现对抗性输入在早期卷积层中会使激活熵产生7%的偏移，从而实现对对抗性输入的检测。

Result: 实验表明，对抗性输入与干净输入的熵分布完全分离，检测准确率达到90%，误报率和漏报率均低于20%。

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，这为实时检测对抗性输入的自诊断视觉系统提供了实用部署方案，且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，通过3D CAD模型和高级渲染技术生成数字测量设备(DMD)的VQA标注数据集，显著提升大视觉语言模型在真实场景下的读数能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在数字测量设备读数任务中表现不佳，特别是在存在遮挡、极端视角、运动模糊等真实场景条件下，需要专门的数据集来提升模型鲁棒性

Method: 利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术开发CAD2DMD-SET工具，生成多样化的合成DMD数据集，并创建DMDBench包含1000张真实标注图像的验证集

Result: 对三个先进LVLM模型进行基准测试，使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据集微调后，InternVL模型得分提升200%，且不影响其他任务性能

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET合成数据集能显著提升LVLM在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和性能，该工具将开源发布，支持社区扩展不同测量设备和生成自定义数据集

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Motivation: 当前视觉声音源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应场景（如静音、噪声、屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且现有评估主要局限于正样本场景。

Method: 提出包含静音和噪声的新训练策略，开发自监督模型SSL-SaN，设计新的对齐和可分离性量化指标，扩展IS3+合成数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了负音频场景下的声音源定位问题，为更全面的评估提供了新的指标和数据集。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强领域感知表示和分离领域不变分类，改进CLIP在域泛化任务中的性能，特别是在分布外数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP可能不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独领域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的领域感知；2）通过合成多样化领域数据；3）鼓励从领域特征中分离实现领域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在33个多样化数据集上相比现有方法有显著改进，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现更好

Conclusion: 增强领域感知是基础模型中实现有效领域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过分离分类和领域表示的方法成功提升了域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了非典型视频数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中面对罕见新概念时表现出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。本文探索非典型视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频（如科幻、动画等）的新数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，并在三个关键任务上进行评估：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Result: 使用非典型数据的学习方法在各种设置下都能持续提升性能；增加非典型样本的类别多样性可进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用较小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性有助于模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励在该方向进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但在无监督持续学习领域研究不足。现有方法依赖标签和任务边界，而实际应用中获取标注数据成本高且不实用

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer网络提取深度嵌入特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为数据的非参数概率表示，引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展内存聚类

Conclusion: 提出的非参数学习方法有效解决了无监督视频持续学习的挑战，无需使用任何标签或类别边界，为视频持续学习提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌的MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据条件下仍能保持高性能的分割方法。

Method: 采用nnU-Net框架，使用深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案和训练计划，并构建定制化的异构集成专家模型。

Result: 在Task 1上获得了0.661的肿瘤Dice分数，Task 2上获得0.523的Dice分数，达到了最先进的边界精度（MASD为5.46 mm，HD95为17.33 mm）。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型提供了稳健的方法论，通过度量感知的集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Motivation: 评估GPT-5在临床决策支持，特别是放射肿瘤学领域的性能表现，验证其作为临床辅助工具的可行性。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例的治疗方案生成评估，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家进行评分。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)；在病例治疗建议中正确性评分3.24/4，完整性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但仍有改进空间，生成的建议需要专家严格监督才能临床使用。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

### [93] [DriveQA: Passing the Driving Knowledge Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21824)
*Maolin Wei,Wanzhou Liu,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调和预训练可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要创建一个更全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉内容，全面覆盖交通规则和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调、环境因素敏感性分析以及下游任务性能测试。

Result: 1) 现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3) DriveQA-V的环境变化分析揭示了模型对光照、视角、距离和天气条件的敏感性；4) 在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA基准测试揭示了当前LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识理解方面的局限性，但通过针对性的训练可以显著改善模型性能。该基准为开发更安全的自动驾驶系统提供了重要工具，证明了模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识来有效泛化到下游问答任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

TL;DR: 巴西儿童使用对话代理的研究，通过结构化支架提升交互效果，发现配方式提示方法在可读性、问题深度和连贯性方面优于非结构化基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究巴西儿童如何利用对话代理进行学习、探索和娱乐，以及如何通过结构化支架来增强这些交互体验，填补了在巴西儿童群体中应用认知工作分析的空白

Method: 研究1：对23名参与者进行7周在线调查，使用访谈、观察和认知工作分析；研究2：使用GPT-4o-mini对1200个模拟儿童-对话代理交换进行提示测试，比较结构化配方与无结构基线

Result: 确定了对话代理的三种功能（学校、发现、娱乐），开发了反映亲子支持的配方支架，定量评估显示配方方法在可读性、问题数量/深度/多样性和连贯性方面有提升

Conclusion: 提出了设计建议：支架式对话树、儿童专用个性化配置文件、看护人策划内容，贡献包括首个巴西儿童CWA应用、儿童-对话代理信息流实证框架以及有效的LLM支架配方方法

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

TL;DR: Morae是一个UI代理系统，通过识别任务执行中的决策点并暂停让用户选择，提升盲人和低视力用户的控制权


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务而不让用户参与关键选择，减少了用户自主权，特别是在价格相同但产品特性不同的情况下

Method: 使用大型多模态模型解释用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要决策时提示用户澄清选择

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，Morae帮助用户完成更多任务并选择更符合偏好的选项，优于包括OpenAI Operator在内的基线代理

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了混合主动方法，用户既能从UI代理自动化中受益，又能表达个人偏好

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较适用于群体公平和个体公平的评估指标，发现推荐系统中高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平，揭示了两种公平类型之间的冲突关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的公平性通常分为群体公平和个体公平，但现有研究对这两种公平类型之间的关系缺乏科学理解，因为使用了不同的评估指标或目标，无法进行直接比较。

Method: 通过对适用于两种公平类型的评估指标进行全面比较，在3个数据集上对8个运行结果进行实验分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平，揭示了群体公平与个体公平之间的冲突关系。

Conclusion: 该发现对推荐系统从业者改进系统公平性具有重要价值，表明需要在群体公平和个体公平之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: CrossTL是一个通用的编程语言翻译器，通过统一的中间表示CrossGL实现多种编程语言之间的双向翻译，支持CUDA、HIP、Metal、DirectX HLSL、OpenGL GLSL、Vulkan SPIR-V、Rust和Mojo等语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每种语言对单独构建翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。CrossTL旨在通过统一的中间表示简化多语言翻译，实现"一次编写，到处部署"的开发模式。

Method: 系统包含语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块（ToCrossGLConverter类用于导入代码，CodeGen类用于目标生成），以及处理完整翻译管道的全面后端实现。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，在所有支持的后端上实现了成功的编译和执行。统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需最少的工作量，仅需要语言特定的前端/后端组件。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，证明了通用代码翻译的实际可行性，其模块化架构支持可扩展性，为GPU计算、图形编程和系统语言提供了全面框架。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型架构中的归纳偏置如何影响其在教学对话中的认知行为，旨在通过结构化机制提升模型的教学推理能力。

Method: 采用符号支架机制配合短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，包括支架、响应性、符号推理和对话记忆等方面。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最佳，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为，包括抽象能力、适应性探询和概念连续性。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明结构化机制对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM是一个综合性的音频-语言模型基准测试，集成了10个重要评估维度，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了评估流程。测试了14个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在多数方面领先但存在公平性问题，基线系统表现意外良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，各评估只关注一两个能力维度，且使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型间难以公平比较。

Method: 开发AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括新的PARADE和CoRe-Bench合成数据集），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，在10个维度上全面评估14个开源和闭源模型以及3个基线系统。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个维度中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具备语音转文本能力的系统总体排名第5。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了音频-语言模型的全面标准化评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势与不足，特别是公平性问题。该基准将持续更新，促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扶贫和乡村振兴战略的深入，改善农村人居环境成为重点。现有问卷方法难以规模化，城市导向的视觉感知方法不适合农村场景，需要开发专门的农村宜居性评估方法。

Method: 采用自上而下方法收集1766个村庄的无人机影像，开发高效的图像比较机制和二进制搜索插值，构建基于专家知识的思维链提示，从生活质量和生态宜居性两个维度评估。

Result: 中国农村宜居性呈现双核-边缘空间格局，以四川和浙江为中心向外辐射递减；政府财政支出是核心影响因素，每单位增加对应3.9-4.9单位的宜居性提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为农村建设政策制定提供了有价值的见解，证明了无人机影像和MLLMs在农村宜居性评估中的有效性。

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

Abstract: Unregistered surface meshes, especially raw 3D scans, present significant
challenges for automatic computation of plausible deformations due to the lack
of established point-wise correspondences and the presence of noise in the

motion prediction and transfer on such body meshes. Our method couples a robust
motion embedding network with a learned per-vertex feature field to generate a
spatio-temporal deformation field, which drives the mesh deformation. Extensive
evaluations, including quantitative benchmarks and qualitative visuals on tasks
such as walking and running, demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Conclusion: 两种互补的正则化策略有效改善了3D高斯泼溅的重建质量，为高质量3D网格和视觉重建提供了改进方案

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Result: 所有测试模型均未达到95%的能力阈值，最佳模型准确率为82%，文本任务表现优于图像推理任务，后者常接近随机猜测水平

Conclusion: 当前LLM在热力学领域的有限速率/不可逆场景和视觉特征与热力学意义的绑定方面存在明显不足，尚不适合无监督教学使用

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制中需要结合本体感觉和视觉信息以实现鲁棒控制的问题，传统方法在样本效率、动作抖动和能耗方面存在不足

Method: 提出QuadKAN框架，使用样条参数化的跨模态策略，包含样条编码器处理本体感觉输入和样条融合头处理多模态输入；采用多模态延迟随机化和PPO算法进行端到端训练

Result: 在多种地形（平坦/不平坦表面、静态/动态障碍物）上的评估显示，QuadKAN相比SOTA基线方法获得更高回报、更远距离和更少碰撞

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒的视觉引导运动控制提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable

autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field,
comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared
camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single
Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel
odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in
agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion

TL;DR: Miffie是一个基于大语言模型的数据库自动化规范化框架，采用双模型自优化架构实现高精度模式生成和验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库规范化需要人工操作，耗时且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构：生成模块消除异常，验证模块提供反馈，结合任务特定的零样本提示

Result: 实验结果显示Miffie能够规范化复杂数据库模式并保持高精度

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了数据库规范化的自动化，无需人工干预且保持高准确性

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了量子文本生成模型与传统Transformer/MLP架构的性能对比，发现传统Transformer在总体上仍保持优势，但量子受启发的模型在特定场景中也表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因对量子计算在自然语言处理领域应用的日益增长兴趣，需要系统性地评估量子文本生成模型的性能与传统方法的对比。

Method: 进行系统实验比较五种模型：Transformer(基准)、QKSAN、QRWKV、QASA，在五个多样化数据集上评测，使用语言模型评估指标如困惑度、BLEU分数、词汇多样性、重复率和流畅度等。

Result: 传统Transformer模型在总体上显示优势，最低平均困惑度(1.21)和最高BLEU-1分数(0.2895)。但量子受启发模型在特定场景中表现竞争力：QKSAN达到BLEU-1分数0.2800且重复率为零，QRWKV在某些任务中实现了完美词汇多样性。

Conclusion: 虽然传统Transformer模型在总体性能上仍然领先，但量子受启发的模型在特定文本生成任务中显示出了潜力，为量子计算在NLP领域的应用提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合字符串相似度、主题建模、层次聚类和基于规则的流水线方法，用于聚类银行支付系统中的交易对手方，解决了传统自然语言处理模型不适用于短文本聚类的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自然语言处理模型不适合聚类银行支付消息系统（如SWIFT）中的交易对手方，因为这些手动输入的标签缺乏句子结构但包含各种变体和噪声。现有工具主要依赖模糊匹配，存在性能不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合方法：结合字符串相似度计算、主题建模、层次聚类和基于规则的流水线，支持未知数量的预期聚类。同时设计了基于精确率和召回率的评估指标。

Result: 在真实标注数据集上的测试显示，该方法相比基于规则的基线方法性能显著提升，同时保持了规则系统的可解释性，减少了人工审查需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了交易对手方聚类问题，在制裁调查等场景中能够更好地控制遗漏实体变体的风险，为反欺诈专业人员提供了更好的工具支持。

Abstract: Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community.
When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

*Haoze Wu,Cheng Wang,Wenshuo Zhao,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现RL在LLMs中的反直觉现象（如单样本训练、不精确奖励信号、仅用负样本训练等）只在模型与任务已经高度对齐时有效，而在更具挑战性的场景中，标准RL方法仍然更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期RL在LLMs应用中报告了一系列反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件和失败情况尚不清楚，需要系统研究其背后的关键因素。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，在不同模型架构和任务领域中检验一系列反直觉主张，重点关注预训练模型的模型-任务对齐程度（以pass@k准确率衡量）。

Result: 研究表明，标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果仅在模型与任务已经表现出强对齐时出现；在更具挑战性的情况下，这些技术无法驱动实质性学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL方法在困难场景中仍然有效，而反直觉技术只在特定对齐条件下适用。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地用于高风险决策任务（如贷款审批），需要评估其在处理表格数据时的性能和公平性问题

Method: 使用来自加纳、德国和美国的序列化贷款审批数据集，评估LLM的零样本学习和上下文学习能力，比较不同序列化格式的效果

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLM的性能和公平性，某些格式（如GReat和LIFT）虽然提高了F1分数但加剧了公平性差距；ICL相比零样本学习将性能提升了4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响在不同数据集中差异很大

Conclusion: 需要开发有效的表格数据表示方法和具有公平性意识的模型，以提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

TL;DR: 提出ActSub方法，通过奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将激活分解为决定性成分和无关成分，分别处理远分布偏移和近分布偏移的OOD检测问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在现实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)样本，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测需求

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为对分类输出贡献最大的决定性子空间和贡献最小的无关子空间，针对远OOD使用无关成分检测，针对近OOD使用决定性成分检测

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: ActSub方法通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，有效利用不同子空间特性，在远分布偏移和近分布偏移情况下都能实现优异的OOD检测效果

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一个处理心率预测中数据异质性（设备源异质性和用户异质性）的框架，通过随机特征丢弃和时间感知注意力模块，在新建的ParroTao数据集和FitRec数据集上分别提升17%和15%的性能。

Motivation: 心率预测在现实部署中面临数据异质性的关键挑战，包括设备源异质性（不同设备特征集不同）和用户异质性（不同用户生理模式差异）。现有方法要么丢弃设备特定信息，要么无法建模用户特定差异，限制了实际性能。

Method: 提出学习对两种异质性都不敏感的潜在表示框架：1）随机特征丢弃策略处理设备源异质性，使模型对多种特征集具有鲁棒性；2）时间感知注意力模块捕获长期生理特征，结合对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间。

Result: 在新建的ParroTao数据集和公开的FitRec数据集上，模型分别显著超越现有基线17%和15%。学习到的表示展现出强大的判别能力，下游应用任务验证了模型的实用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了心率预测中的数据异质性问题，通过创新的特征处理和表示学习方法，在多个数据集上实现了显著性能提升，为现实世界健康监测应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.
