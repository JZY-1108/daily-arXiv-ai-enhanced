### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StreetMath基准，用于评估大语言模型在现实世界近似场景下的数学近似推理能力，发现LLMs在需要近似计算的任务中仍倾向于进行精确计算或调用外部工具，且近似与精确算术运算依赖不同的神经组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在精确算术运算上的表现，但对其在非正式、快速数学运算中的近似推理能力研究不足，特别是在非自回归解码器模型中。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准，对多种LLM架构（Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507、Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507等）进行广泛评估，并应用机制可解释性技术探查其内部计算状态。

Result: LLMs在近似任务中仍试图计算精确值或调用外部工具；模型有时在早期层或步骤就得到正确答案，但在解决近似任务时仍消耗更多token；精确和近似算术运算依赖基本分离的神经组件。

Conclusion: LLMs在街算场景中不像人类那样表现出认知吝啬性，近似与精确算术运算在神经层面存在分离。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和句法依赖解析的细粒度情感分析方法，能够对实体评论进行强度分级（非常弱、弱、中等、强、非常强）的排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于词典的情感分析方法无法考虑意见的强度差异，无法区分非常强烈、强烈、中等、非常弱和弱等不同强度的情感表达。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑算法将意见词分类到不同强度类别，使用句法依赖解析找到与目标方面词的关系，考虑与特定方面相关的意见词来计算实体得分。

Result: 该方法能够对实体评论进行细粒度的强度分级和排名，考虑了副词、形容词、名词和动词等多种意见词类型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地分析用户对产品特定方面的情感倾向和强度，为基于意见的实体排名提供了更精细的解决方案。

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了LASTIST数据集，这是一个大规模的目标无关立场检测数据集，包含563,299个韩语句子，旨在填补韩语立场检测研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前立场检测研究主要集中在目标依赖任务上，且大多数基准数据集基于英语，难以在韩语等低资源语言中开发模型。

Method: 从韩国政党的新闻稿中收集数据，构建包含563,299个标注韩语句子的LASTIST数据集，并训练最先进的深度学习模型。

Result: 成功构建了大规模韩语立场检测数据集，支持目标无关立场检测和时间演化立场检测等多种任务。

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为韩语立场检测研究提供了重要资源，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出zFLoRA零延迟融合低秩适配器，在基础模型上引入零或可忽略的延迟开销，解决了传统适配器在推理时计算开销过大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署时使用任务特定适配器，虽然适配器参数很少（通常小于基础模型的1%），但在推理时会产生不成比例的高计算开销（可达基础模型的2.5倍）。

Method: 提出zFLoRA零延迟融合低秩适配器，通过融合技术消除适配器带来的额外延迟，在NPU和GPU平台上实现零到可忽略的延迟开销。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的LLM上进行实验，在18个不同任务（常识推理、数学推理、摘要对话）上表现优于流行的监督微调基准，包括LoRA和全微调。

Conclusion: zFLoRA在保持性能的同时，显著降低了适配器在推理时的计算开销，为多任务适配器部署提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进电路发现的方法：使用自举法识别一致归因边、引入基于比率的策略选择强正分数边、用整数线性规划替代贪婪选择，在多个任务和模型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机制可解释性中电路发现的主要挑战，即确定模型中执行特定任务的部分，基于Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB)进行改进。

Method: 1. 使用自举法识别具有一致归因分数的边；2. 引入基于比率的简单选择策略，优先考虑强正分数边，平衡性能和忠实度；3. 用整数线性规划替代标准贪婪选择方法。

Result: 方法产生了更忠实的电路，在多个MIB任务和模型上优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的三种改进方法有效提升了电路发现的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN框架使用LLM作为零样本偏好预言机，通过自然语言优先级指导，在多项任务中实现复杂多目标决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专家难以从大量选项中基于复杂隐含偏好选择最佳方案的问题，降低传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Method: 提出两种迭代算法：LISTEN-U使用LLM精炼参数化效用函数；LISTEN-T采用非参数方法进行锦标赛式选择。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等任务中，LISTEN-U在偏好参数化对齐时表现优异，LISTEN-T提供更稳健性能。

Conclusion: 探索了用自然语言直接指导复杂多目标决策的有前景方向，减轻了传统偏好获取的认知负担。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter框架通过对比长短上下文预测差异来筛选具有长距离依赖的高质量训练数据，显著提升长上下文语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长文本数据大多缺乏有意义的长距离依赖关系，导致训练效率低下，需要精心选择训练数据。

Method: 提出LongFilter框架，通过对比模型在长上下文和短上下文设置下的预测差异，衡量扩展上下文提供的信息增益，识别长距离依赖关键样本。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上将上下文长度从8K扩展到64K，LongFilter能高效选择高质量数据，在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准测试上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: LongFilter为长上下文预训练提供了有效的数据筛选方法，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管人物角色对LLM的有害内容分类准确率影响不大，但会引入意识形态偏见，导致模型在不同政治立场下对内容危害性的判断产生系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在内容审核系统中使用人物角色时如何影响公平性和中立性，探索不同意识形态倾向的人物角色对有害内容分类一致性的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析不同LLM架构、模型大小和内容模态下，人物角色对有害内容分类的影响，包括一致性分析、协议分析和政治针对性任务的额外研究。

Result: 人物角色导致模型在相同意识形态内更一致，但跨意识形态分歧加大；模型倾向于维护自身意识形态观点，弱化对立观点的危害性。

Conclusion: 人物角色调节会在LLM输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，对以中立性为幌子强化党派观点的AI系统使用提出担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR方法通过实体感知检索在临床问答中实现了90%的F1分数，比传统嵌入检索提升4%，同时减少70%以上的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中FHIR DocumentReference资源存储的临床文档难以进行语义问答的问题，传统向量数据库方法常忽略细微的临床关系。

Method: 开发临床实体增强检索方法，使用实体感知检索技术，并构建临床笔记问答评估平台进行验证。

Result: 在12个临床笔记测试中，CLEAR获得58.3%胜率，平均语义相似度0.878，token使用量减少78%。在超过65,000 token的长文档中胜率达75%。

Conclusion: 实体感知检索显著提升临床自然语言处理的效率和准确性，评估框架为临床问答系统提供了可重用且透明的基准。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了使用LLM进行FrameNet语义标注的自动化和半自动化方法，发现半自动方法在帧多样性和标注覆盖率方面表现最佳，而纯自动方法除标注时间外其他指标均较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言资源创建中应用广泛，但缺乏对其在标注数据集创建中性能和影响的全面评估，特别是在视角化NLP方法下。

Method: 比较了三种实验设置下的标注时间、覆盖率和多样性：手动标注、自动标注和半自动标注。

Result: 半自动标注设置相比纯人工设置提高了帧多样性，标注覆盖率相似；而自动设置在除标注时间外的所有指标上都表现较差。

Conclusion: 半自动标注方法在语义角色标注任务中具有优势，能够平衡效率和标注质量。

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP是一个代理式管道，通过反馈驱动循环从LLM输出中提取和验证记忆的训练数据，包含越狱模块克服对齐导致的拒绝，在EchoTrace基准测试中显著优于单次迭代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，需要一种方法来确认模型是否见过特定内容，最有力的证据是模型自由复现目标内容。

Method: 采用反馈驱动循环：初始提取尝试由次级语言模型评估，与参考段落比较识别差异，生成最小修正提示反馈给目标模型指导后续生成；包含越狱模块检测和克服对齐导致的拒绝。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试中，GPT-4.1提取受版权文本的ROUGE-L得分从0.38提升到0.47，增长近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP通过反馈驱动循环和越狱模块，能够有效提取和验证LLM记忆的训练数据，显著优于传统单次迭代方法。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究挑战了多语言训练中的常见假设，发现适当平衡的多语言数据可以增强语言模型能力而不会降低性能，即使在低资源语言中也是如此。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言数据混合对大型语言模型预训练的影响，特别是关于语言覆盖范围与模型性能之间权衡的争议（即多语言诅咒）。

Method: 训练了1.1B和3B参数的大型语言模型，使用不同的多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400种不等，测试英语作为枢纽语言的效果。

Result: 发现结合英语和多语言数据不会降低任何语言组的性能；英语作为枢纽语言对所有语系都有益；未观察到显著的多语言诅咒现象。

Conclusion: 多语言数据在适当平衡时可以增强语言模型能力，而不会损害性能，即使在低资源设置下也是如此。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 机器翻译在低资源语言中广泛用于生成合成数据，但文化差异会导致语义标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域。研究发现LLMs编码文化知识会放大标签漂移，文化相似性是标签保持的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器翻译中文化对齐对语义标签保持的影响，填补文化因素在翻译中作用的空白，揭示文化差异如何导致标签漂移。

Method: 通过跨文化敏感和中性领域的一系列实验，比较不同机器翻译系统（包括现代LLMs）在文化相似和不相似语言对中的表现。

Result: 发现：(1)机器翻译系统（包括LLMs）在翻译过程中诱导标签漂移，特别是在文化敏感领域；(2)LLMs编码文化知识会放大标签漂移；(3)源语言和目标语言的文化相似性是标签保持的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 忽视机器翻译中的文化因素不仅会削弱标签保真度，还会在下游应用中导致误解和文化冲突的风险。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode是一个神经符号框架，将数学问题解决重构为基于SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，显著提升了LLM在复杂数学推理中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中表现不佳，基于文本的生成方法缺乏确定性验证机制，导致解决方案不可靠且算术上不健全。

Method: 提出SymCode框架，将数学问题解决转化为使用SymPy库的可验证代码生成任务，通过符号引擎为LLM推理提供确定性基础。

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench等挑战性基准测试中，相比基线方法准确率提升高达13.6个百分点，且token效率更高。

Conclusion: SymCode通过将LLM推理建立在确定性符号引擎上，代表了在形式化领域实现更准确和可信AI的关键一步，将模型失败从模糊的逻辑谬误转向透明的程序化错误。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对AWS Trainium AI加速器，设计了高性能的矩阵乘法内核，通过内核融合和新型缓存策略优化数据移动，在LLM推理中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trainium AI加速器虽然为LLM训练和推理提供了有吸引力的选择，但其脉动阵列架构和数据布局的特殊要求使得实现高性能具有挑战性，特别是矩阵乘法这一关键计算内核。

Method: 基于内核融合和新型缓存策略，针对Trainium架构定制了一系列技术，减少软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化SRAM带宽，避免昂贵的矩阵转置操作。

Result: 在9个数据集和4个最新LLM上的评估显示，相比AWS实现的最先进矩阵乘法，在矩阵乘法内核层面平均加速1.35倍（最高2.22倍），端到端LLM推理平均加速1.66倍（最高2.49倍）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在Trainium加速器上显著提升了矩阵乘法和LLM推理的性能，证明了定制化优化策略的有效性。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: AttnCache是一个加速LLM预填充阶段的框架，通过重用相似注意力图来减少自注意力计算的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际工作负载仅依赖预填充阶段，而自注意力计算因其二次复杂度成为主要性能瓶颈。研究发现不同语义的句子在层和头上会产生相似的注意力图。

Method: 基于注意力图记忆数据库，采用高效缓存和相似性搜索技术，在推理时识别并重用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: 在CPU上实现平均1.2倍端到端和2倍注意力加速，在GPU上实现1.6倍端到端和3倍注意力加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: AttnCache通过重用相似注意力图有效加速了LLM预填充阶段的推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了监督强化学习(SRL)框架，将问题解决重新定义为生成逻辑"动作"序列，解决了小规模开源模型在多步推理任务中的训练困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理任务上表现不佳。对于小规模开源模型，强化学习在正确解很少被采样时失败，而监督微调则容易通过逐词模仿过度拟合长演示。

Method: SRL框架训练模型在提交每个动作前生成内部推理独白，基于模型动作与SFT数据集中专家动作的相似性提供平滑奖励，即使在所有rollout都不正确时也能提供丰富的学习信号。

Result: SRL使小模型能够学习SFT或RLVR无法学习的挑战性问题。先用SRL初始化训练再用RLVR精炼可获得最强性能。SRL还能有效泛化到代理软件工程任务。

Conclusion: SRL是一个用于推理导向LLM的稳健且通用的训练框架，通过结合监督学习和强化学习的优势，解决了小模型在多步推理任务中的训练难题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: PORTool是一种基于强化学习的工具使用LLM训练方法，通过探索多种工具调用轨迹来提高在动态环境中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具使用LLM在静态数据集上训练，只能模仿通用工具调用流程，无法探索可能的解决方案，在动态工具调用环境中表现有限

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM探索多种轨迹：1)为查询生成多个rollout形成树状结构；2)基于产生正确答案和成功工具调用的能力分配步骤奖励；3)使用步骤相对优势和轨迹相对优势训练LLM

Result: 在17个工具的实验中，PORTool在最终准确率和工具调用步骤数量方面相比其他训练方法有显著改进

Conclusion: PORTool通过强化学习探索多种工具调用轨迹，有效提升了LLM在动态工具使用环境中的性能

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出跨语言对齐(CLA)可能导致"文化擦除"问题，并引入转移-本地化平面评估框架来量化知识转移与文化本地化之间的权衡。研究发现现有CLA方法在改善事实转移的同时损害了文化本地化，并提出基于模型层分析的外科手术式引导方法来解决这一矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言对齐旨在对齐多语言表示，但可能导致文化擦除问题——即失去提供基于查询语言的文化情境化响应的能力。需要系统分析知识转移与文化本地化之间的权衡关系。

Method: 1) 引入转移-本地化平面评估框架；2) 重新评估现有CLA方法；3) 分析模型内部表示；4) 提出外科手术式引导方法，在推理时对不同的模型层应用有针对性的激活引导。

Result: 研究发现现有CLA方法在6种语言中都一致改善了事实转移，但直接以文化本地化为代价。模型内部表示分析表明，通用事实转移和文化特定知识在不同模型层中具有最优可引导性。

Conclusion: 通过外科手术式引导方法，可以更好地平衡知识转移和文化本地化这两个竞争维度，有效克服当前对齐技术的局限性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于自然语言处理的工具来识别放射学报告中的偶发甲状腺发现，发现ITFs很常见且与甲状腺癌过度诊断相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偶发甲状腺发现在非甲状腺指征的影像学检查中日益增多，但其患病率、特征和临床后果尚不明确。

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用基于transformer的NLP流程从多模态影像报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名患者中，7.8%有ITFs，其中92.9%为结节。ITFs患者甲状腺结节诊断、活检、甲状腺切除术和甲状腺癌诊断的几率更高。

Conclusion: ITFs很常见且与检测小型低风险癌症的级联反应密切相关，强调了ITFs在甲状腺癌过度诊断中的作用以及标准化报告和选择性随访的必要性。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark是一个评估LLM在量子编程任务中表现的新框架，支持量子模拟器环境并提供领域特定指标反馈。实验显示GPT-4o准确率仅18.97%，而推理模型o3可达78%，超越人类代码平均成功率39.98%。


<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM在需要与硬件设备交互的领域（如量子编程）表现不佳，缺乏专门的评估框架。量子编程涉及Python代码在量子计算机上执行，需要超越传统Python执行的评估方法。

Method: 引入QCoder Benchmark评估框架，支持量子模拟器环境，提供电路深度、执行时间、错误分类等域特定指标反馈。整合真实编程竞赛中的人类编写代码，支持定量比较和定性分析。

Result: GPT-4o准确率仅18.97%，推理模型o3达到78%准确率，显著优于人类代码平均成功率39.98%。表明推理能力对量子编程任务至关重要。

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark揭示了当前LLM在量子编程领域的局限性，同时展示了推理模型在该任务上的优势。该基准数据集和公共评估API将为后续研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统1P1S训练导致模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时缩放的效果，需要增加推理路径的多样性

Method: 提出1PNS训练范式，使用RPD指标量化多步思维链的语义差异，选择最大多样性的解决方案集进行微调

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base上实验，RPD选择的训练集带来更多样化输出和更高pass@k，平均pass@16提升2.80%，AIME24上提升4.99%

Conclusion: 1PNS训练范式能有效增强测试时缩放的效果，通过增加推理多样性提升模型性能

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏同时标注说服技巧和语篇关系的数据集，研究旨在探索这两种语言现象之间的关系，以帮助检测网络宣传和错误信息。

Method: 使用SemEval 2023 Task 3数据集，开发基于LLM的分类器标注PDTB 3.0语篇关系，评估4个LLM和10种提示，构建5个银数据集。

Result: 统计分析显示六种语篇关系（原因、目的、对比、原因+信念、让步、条件）在说服性文本中至关重要，特别是在使用负载语言、夸张/最小化、重复和引发怀疑时。

Conclusion: 研究为理解有效沟通提供了新视角，有助于检测网络宣传和错误信息，揭示了语篇关系在说服过程中的重要作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Motivation: 当前基于状态空间/门控循环模型的方法通常只模拟单个注意力头，可能限制了表达能力。

Method: 采用混合专家实现，不仅在通道混合MLP块中使用，还在时间混合SSM核中实现多个"注意力头"。

Result: 在语言建模和下游评估中，MossNet在相似模型大小和数据预算下优于transformer和SSM架构。更大规模的变体在万亿token训练中进一步证实了其可扩展性和优越性能。

Conclusion: MossNet为高效、高性能的循环LLM架构提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在指令遵循任务中可能存在校准不足和统计效率低的问题，需要改进模型在高质量生成区域的性能。

Method: 对预训练的仅解码器Transformer LM进行监督微调，使用最终层SDM激活层估计对比输入编码方案中监督下一个标记损失的基数变化，并在训练期间在线生成硬负例。

Result: 与强监督基线相比，SDM LM减少了弃权（即提高了统计效率）。

Conclusion: SDM LM能够有效提高语言模型在指令遵循任务中的统计效率和生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

TL;DR: RCScore是一个多维度框架，用于量化指令表述对LLM响应的影响，通过系统地将基准问题转换为多种指令风格来揭示传统指标无法检测的性能变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常依赖单一指令模板，忽视了模型对指令风格的敏感性，这对于实际部署至关重要。

Method: 通过将基准问题系统性地转换为多种指令风格，并引入跨响应相似性(CRS)来测量风格自一致性。

Result: 在四个推理基准上对十个LLM的实验表明，指令风格可使准确率变化高达16.7个百分点，且CRS与任务准确率强相关。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一个原则性方法来评估指令鲁棒性，确定性解码产生更稳定的输出，模型规模与跨风格一致性正相关。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation (TTA)，通过为每个token分配时间步调度实现软语义排序：关键token早期冻结，不确定token持续优化。支持固定策略和基于任务信号的自适应策略。

Result: 在情感控制任务中，准确率提升超过20%，困惑度减半且仅需不到1/5的步骤；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性从14.5降至12.2，困惑度从32.0降至26.0。

Conclusion: 通过时间步分配实现的软化排序是缓解更新遗忘、实现稳定可控扩散文本生成的关键机制。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

TL;DR: WIMHF方法使用稀疏自编码器解释人类反馈数据，识别可解释特征来理解偏好数据中的偏好表达和测量能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈可能以不可预测的方式改变语言模型，但缺乏对反馈数据编码内容的清晰理解，需要自动提取相关特征而不预先指定假设。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（WIMHF方法）分析7个数据集，识别人类可解释的特征，这些特征能够解释偏好预测信号的主要部分。

Result: WIMHF识别出少量可解释特征，揭示了人类偏好的多样性，发现不同数据集用户偏好差异（如Reddit用户偏好非正式和笑话，而HH-RLHF和PRISM标注者不喜欢）。还发现潜在不安全偏好，如LMArena用户倾向于反对拒绝回答，常支持有毒内容。

Conclusion: WIMHF提供了一种以人为中心的分析方法，帮助从业者更好地理解和利用偏好数据，通过特征学习实现有效数据整理和细粒度个性化。

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估全局RAG能力的基准GlobalQA，并开发了GlobalRAG框架来解决现有方法在全局任务上的性能不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG评估基准主要关注局部RAG（从少量文档中检索相关片段），但现实应用需要全局RAG能力——跨整个文档集合聚合分析信息以得出语料库级洞察。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架：通过块级检索保持结构连贯性，集成LLM驱动的智能过滤器消除噪声文档，并包含用于精确符号计算的聚合模块。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GlobalRAG达到6.63 F1分数，而最强基线仅为1.51 F1，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 全局RAG是一个重要但被忽视的能力，提出的GlobalQA基准和GlobalRAG框架为解决这一挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 通过提供语用学理论作为提示，可以显著提升语言模型在理解隐含含义任务上的表现，最高提升9.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确理解隐含含义对人类沟通至关重要，语言模型也需要具备这种能力。语用学理论为理解隐含含义提供了系统框架。

Method: 将语用学理论（如格赖斯语用学和关联理论）概述作为提示提供给语言模型，引导其通过逐步推理过程得出最终解释。

Result: 相比仅提示中间推理的基线方法，该方法使语言模型在语用推理任务上得分最高提升9.6%。在大型模型中，仅提及语用学理论名称也能带来1-3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 将语用学理论作为提示是提升语言模型理解隐含含义能力的有效上下文学习方法。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练语言模型在识别借词方面的能力，发现尽管有明确的指令和上下文信息，模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现不佳，这证实了NLP系统对借词存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究预训练语言模型是否具备类似人类说话者识别借词的能力，特别是在双语社区中，主导语言持续对少数民族语言施加词汇影响的情况下。

Method: 评估了包括大语言模型在内的多个预训练语言模型，在10种语言上进行借词识别测试。

Result: 模型在区分借词和原生词方面表现不佳，即使有明确的指令和上下文信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了现代NLP系统对借词存在偏见，这对开发少数民族语言的NLP工具和支持面临主导语言词汇压力的社区语言保护具有重要意义。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

TL;DR: 本文对多语言视觉语言模型的知识蒸馏进行了实证研究，发现不同蒸馏方法在模型压缩时对跨语言表示一致性和下游性能稳定性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在不同语言间性能不均衡，模型尺寸减小会加剧这一问题。知识蒸馏在将知识从大模型转移到小模型方面有潜力，但在多语言环境中的应用研究不足。

Method: 研究了五种知识蒸馏方法，在CLIP和SigLIP2模型上进行实验，评估了领域内检索和领域外视觉问答任务。

Result: 某些配置在模型尺寸减半的情况下仍能保持甚至提升多语言检索鲁棒性，但其他方法无法维持跨任务稳定性，揭示了仅靠聚合准确率无法发现的设计敏感权衡。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在多语言视觉语言模型压缩中具有潜力，但需要仔细选择蒸馏方法以确保跨语言和跨任务的性能稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)方法，通过分析神经元激活的内部信号而非外部输出来改进LLM的推理能力，实现无监督的最佳候选选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外部输出信号（如token概率、熵或自评估），但这些信号在训练后可能校准不佳。作者发现内部神经元激活包含更丰富的信息，正确回答激活更少的神经元且跨样本一致性更强。

Method: 提出NAD方法，基于激活稀疏性和跨样本神经元一致性来选择候选答案，仅使用内部信号且不需要可比较的文本输出。支持早期正确预测和激进早停。

Result: 在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相当；在开放式编码基准测试中优于Avg@64。通过早期修剪减少99%的token使用，生成质量损失最小。

Conclusion: 内部信号为无监督集成解码提供了可靠、可扩展且高效的指导，证明神经元激活模式是比外部信号更优的推理质量指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释为什么LLMs在数字嵌入表示上表现准确，但在处理数字信息时却产生错误输出之间的矛盾现象。

Method: 探索语言模型如何操作数字，量化这些机制的准确度下限，创建通用探针来追踪信息到特定层。

Result: 发现不同语言模型学习到了可互换的数字表示，这些表示在隐藏状态和输入类型中具有系统性、高准确性和普适性。

Conclusion: 为预训练LLMs如何操作数字提供了基础理解，并指出了更精确探针技术在改进LLM架构方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ChatGPT Atlas在信息检索任务中表现出能力，但其在动态交互环境中的性能尚未充分探索，因此使用浏览器游戏作为测试场景进行评估。

Method: 使用浏览器游戏（包括Google的T-Rex Runner、数独、Flappy Bird和Stein.world）作为测试场景，以游戏内性能得分作为量化指标来评估不同任务类型的表现。

Result: Atlas在数独等逻辑推理任务中表现强劲，完成谜题速度显著快于人类基准，但在需要精确时机和运动控制的实时游戏中表现不佳，经常无法通过初始障碍。

Conclusion: 虽然Atlas展示了强大的分析处理能力，但在需要实时交互的动态网页环境中仍存在显著局限性。

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育场景中语言模型部署的三个关键挑战：隐私问题、有限计算资源和需要教学有效反馈，要求小型开源模型能在本地运行并可靠地基于正确信息生成输出。

Method: SCRIBE框架结合领域特定工具与自反推理管道，支持迭代推理、工具使用和错误恢复。通过两阶段LoRA微调在GPT-4o生成的合成数据上训练3B和8B模型。

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可操作性等关键维度上达到或优于更大模型的质量，被学生评价与GPT-4o和Llama-3.3 70B相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE展示了在低资源、隐私敏感教育应用中的可行性，能够提供高质量的学生反馈。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在需要深入原理理解的专业领域（如经济学、心理学）表现不佳。需要一种方法在不牺牲广泛能力的前提下提升专业领域性能。

Method: ACER首先为特定领域生成教科书式的目录结构，然后基于布鲁姆分类法创建问答对，确保系统性的主题覆盖和渐进式难度。使用合成的语料库进行交错课程安排的持续预训练。

Result: 在Llama 3.2模型上，ACER在专业MMLU子集上显著提升性能：在微观经济学等挑战性领域提升5个百分点，所有目标领域平均提升3个百分点。还改善了非目标领域性能0.7点，在ARC和GPQA基准上提升超过2个绝对点。

Conclusion: ACER提供了一种可扩展且有效的方法来弥合大语言模型在关键领域的能力差距，既能防止灾难性遗忘，又能促进正向跨领域知识迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Motivation: 健康相关的错误信息普遍存在且有害，特别是那些歪曲或曲解科学发现的谬误论点难以识别，需要有效方法来增强LLM的谬误识别能力。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)生成合成谬误样本，然后对LLaMA等大语言模型进行轻量微调，利用MISSCI数据集和框架进行训练。

Conclusion: 通过合成谬误数据增强有限标注资源，可以显著提升LLM在真实世界科学错误信息任务中的零样本分类性能，即使在有限计算资源下也能取得良好效果。

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Motivation: 多智能体方法虽然能超越单一模型能力，但成功依赖于协同团队组合。由于模型不透明性，难以获取有效协作所需的内在特征。

Method: 构建语言模型图谱，通过成对对话的语义连贯性映射模型关系，然后应用社区检测识别协同模型集群。

Result: 实验表明该方法能发现反映潜在专业化的功能一致群组，在基准测试中优于随机基线，与基于已知专业化的手动构建团队准确率相当。

Conclusion: 为自动化设计协作多智能体LLM团队提供了新基础。

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

  In this work, we present a preliminary investigation of pretrained language

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied
genre for this task. We examine how context can help with the DRC task, with
our experiments showing that context, as defined by discourse structure, is
generally helpful. We also present an analysis of which scientific discourse
relation types might benefit most from context.

Conclusion: LLM在教育领域的应用仍面临重大挑战，现有模型在知识和素养维度都表现不足，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC方法结合稀疏优化和低秩逼近来压缩大语言模型，无需额外训练就能在保持性能的同时实现50%压缩和1.63倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优异，但部署时面临巨大的带宽和计算需求限制，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 将低秩逼近和稀疏优化统一为一个问题，通过迭代优化算法求解，保留模型核心结构同时去除非必要权重。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen2.5模型(7B-70B)上测试，SSLC方法优于单独使用稀疏或低秩方法，压缩Qwen2.5达50%且性能无损，加速至少1.63倍。

Conclusion: SSLC为高效部署大语言模型提供了实用解决方案，结合稀疏和低秩方法的优势实现更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了BNLF框架，通过贝叶斯网络融合三个LLM的预测结果，在情感分析任务中实现比单个模型高约6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域特定LLM存在透明度低、微调成本高、提示工程复杂、跨领域结果不一致以及高计算需求带来的环境问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络进行后期融合，将FinBERT、RoBERTa和BERTweet三个LLM的情感预测建模为概率节点。

Result: 在三个不同语言和上下文特征的人类标注金融语料库上评估，BNLF相比基线LLM在准确率上获得约6%的稳定提升。

Conclusion: BNLF框架对数据集变化具有鲁棒性，证明了概率融合在可解释情感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用多个LLM代理组成的集成系统来评估AI分诊工具的可靠性，发现集成方法比单一LLM提供更一致和可靠的评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定多个LLM代理的集成是否能够比单一LLM提供更可靠的AI分诊工具评估，解决单一模型可能存在的偏差问题。

Method: 使用29,766个非对比CT头部检查数据，通过8个开源LLM模型和GPT-4o组成的集成系统分析放射学报告，评估颅内出血(ICH)检测AI工具的性能。

Result: Llama3.3:70b和GPT-4o表现最佳(AUC=0.78)，集成方法在MCC指标上优于单一GPT4o模型，且不同集成组合间无显著差异。

Conclusion: 中等至大型开源LLM的集成提供了比单一LLM更一致和可靠的方法，用于临床AI分诊工具的回顾性评估。

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

TL;DR: 本文通过消融实验量化了CORE-KG框架中两个关键组件（共指消解模块和结构化提示）对减少节点重复和噪声的贡献，为从复杂法律文本中提取结构化表示提供了实证指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从法律案例文档构建知识图谱时面临的挑战：文档非结构化、词汇密集、存在模糊或变化的指代，导致传统方法产生噪声大、碎片化的图谱和重复节点。

Method: 对CORE-KG框架进行系统性消融研究，分别移除其两个关键组件：类型感知的共指消解模块和领域引导的结构化提示，量化每个组件对减少节点重复和噪声的贡献。

Result: 移除共指消解导致节点重复增加28.32%，噪声节点增加4.32%；移除结构化提示导致节点重复增加4.34%，噪声节点增加73.33%。

Conclusion: 结构化提示在减少噪声方面更为关键，而共指消解在减少节点重复方面贡献更大，为设计基于LLM的复杂法律文本结构化提取管道提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

TL;DR: DIVRIT是一个新颖的希伯来语变音符号恢复系统，将任务构建为零样本分类问题，使用希伯来语视觉语言模型处理未变音文本图像，在候选集中选择最合适的变音模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希伯来语未变音文本存在高度歧义性，影响准确发音和语义理解，需要开发有效的自动变音符号恢复方法。

Method: 采用零样本分类框架，在单词级别为每个未变音单词从动态生成的候选集中选择最合适的变音模式；关键创新是使用希伯来语视觉语言模型，将未变音文本作为图像处理，直接在输入向量表示中嵌入变音信息。

Result: 在"oracle"设置下（正确变音形式保证在候选集中）达到高准确率；通过架构增强和优化训练方法显著提升了系统的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 视觉表示在准确自动化希伯来语变音符号恢复方面具有巨大潜力，系统能够有效执行变音任务而无需依赖复杂的显式语言分析。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer语言模型中线性关系解码器的结构，发现这些解码器可以高度压缩而不损失精度，因为它们提取的是重复的粗粒度语义属性而非特定关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Hernandez等人[2023]的单关系发现，系统性地探索多个关系解码器的组织结构，解释其可压缩性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用简单三阶张量网络压缩关系解码器集合，开发交叉评估协议将每个线性解码器应用于其他关系的主体。

Result: 线性映射编码的是重复的粗粒度语义属性（如国家-X属性），而非不同关系，这解释了其可压缩性且仅能泛化到语义相近的新关系。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的线性关系解码主要是基于属性的，而非关系特定的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

TL;DR: 本文提出InfoFlow框架，通过子问题分解、失败引导提示和双智能体精炼三个方法，解决深度搜索中奖励密度低的问题，显著提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度搜索场景中奖励密度低，智能体需要付出大量探索成本却只能获得稀疏的最终奖励，这限制了可验证奖励强化学习的应用。

Method: 1) 子问题分解：将长程任务分解为子任务并分配过程奖励；2) 失败引导提示：向停滞轨迹注入修正指导；3) 双智能体精炼：使用精炼智能体压缩搜索历史，减轻探索认知负担。

Result: 在多个智能搜索基准测试中，InfoFlow显著优于强基线方法，使轻量级LLM能够达到与先进专有LLM相当的性能。

Conclusion: InfoFlow通过系统性提高奖励密度，有效解决了深度搜索中的奖励稀疏问题，为可验证奖励强化学习的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型面临自回归设计和巨大规模带来的显著推理延迟问题，而现有的推测解码方法如EAGLE-2和EAGLE-3虽然使用动态树结构改进推测解码，但往往忽略了GPU设备和批量大小等关键系统变量的影响。

Method: 提出CAST动态树解码方法，考虑推理成本（包括GPU配置和批量大小等因素）来动态优化树结构。

Result: 在6个不同任务和6个不同LLM上的综合实验表明，该方法比传统解码方法快达5.2倍，通常比现有最先进技术提升5%-20%的性能。

Conclusion: CAST方法通过考虑系统级推理成本因素来动态优化树结构，显著提高了LLM的推理效率，在多个任务和模型上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent是一个用于理解多模态、多页面、多布局文档（特别是幻灯片）的智能代理框架，通过三级专业化代理（全局、页面、元素）实现细粒度推理，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前系统在处理复杂多页面视觉文档时，特别是在对元素和页面进行细粒度推理方面存在困难，而大语言模型在文档理解方面提供了新的机会。

Method: 采用专业化代理框架，将推理分解为三个层级：全局、页面和元素，构建结构化的、与查询无关的表示，在推理过程中选择性激活专业化代理进行多级推理并整合输出。

Result: 在广泛实验中，SlideAgent相比专有模型整体提升7.9%，相比开源模型整体提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SlideAgent框架通过多级专业化代理有效解决了多页面视觉文档的理解挑战，在文档理解任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视编码器-解码器架构的大语言模型(RedLLM)，通过与当前主流的仅解码器模型(DecLLM)在多个规模(1.5亿到80亿参数)上的全面比较，发现RedLLM具有令人信服的扩展性能和推理效率优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM研究快速从编码器-解码器架构转向仅解码器架构，但缺乏从扩展角度的严谨比较分析，可能低估了编码器-解码器模型的潜力。

Method: 使用前缀语言建模预训练RedLLM，采用仅解码器模型的现代技术配方，在RedPajama V1(1.6T tokens)上进行预训练，使用FLAN进行指令调优，比较不同模型规模下的性能。

Result: RedLLM展现出强大的扩展性能和上下文长度外推能力。虽然DecLLM在预训练阶段计算效率更高，但RedLLM在指令调优后在下游任务上取得相当甚至更好的结果，同时具有显著更好的推理效率。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构的LLM具有被低估的潜力，值得重新审视以开发更强大和高效的LLM。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等数据敏感领域，缺乏高质量领域特定训练语料阻碍了LLMs的专业化应用，而领域专家已将领域智慧提炼成本体规则。

Method: 从原始模型中提取领域本体，使用两个核心本体规则检测不一致性，通过自蒸馏微调强化精炼后的知识。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和Med42-v2上的医疗QA基准测试中，相比未修改模型和领先监督基线，准确率提升高达3.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs在低资源领域适应中提供了有效、高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种混合线性注意力架构，首次在公平比较下超越全注意力机制，在短上下文、长上下文和强化学习场景中均表现优异。核心是KDA模块，通过精细门控机制提升有限状态RNN内存使用效率，结合优化的分块算法实现硬件高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统线性注意力在表达能力上的局限性，同时保持计算效率优势，旨在开发一个既能超越全注意力性能又能显著减少KV缓存和提升解码吞吐量的架构。

Method: 提出Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)线性注意力模块，扩展Gated DeltaNet并加入更精细的门控机制；使用专门的DPLR变体矩阵减少计算量；采用层间混合架构结合KDA和Multi-Head Latent Attention。

Result: 3B激活参数的Kimi Linear模型在所有评估任务中显著超越全MLA，KV缓存使用减少高达75%，1M上下文解码吞吐量提升6倍，在长输入输出任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear可作为全注意力架构的直接替代方案，提供更优性能和效率，特别是在处理长上下文场景时优势明显，相关代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

TL;DR: AutoDeco是一种新型架构，通过在标准transformer上添加轻量级头部，实现真正的端到端生成，让模型能够动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值，从而学习控制自身的解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的"端到端"标签存在误导性，实际上依赖非可微的解码过程，需要人工调整温度、top-p等超参数。AutoDeco旨在实现真正的端到端生成，让模型能够自动学习解码策略。

Method: 在标准transformer基础上添加轻量级头部，在每个步骤动态预测上下文特定的温度值和top-p值以及下一个token的logits，将解码转变为参数化的token级过程。

Result: 在八个基准测试上的实验表明，AutoDeco不仅显著优于默认解码策略，而且性能接近通过"hacking测试集"获得的oracle调优基线。模型还展现出基于指令的解码控制能力，能够理解自然语言指令并相应调整解码参数。

Conclusion: AutoDeco开创了可引导和交互式LLM解码的新范式，通过让模型学习控制自身解码策略，实现了真正的端到端生成能力。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了LLM在训练过程中如何以及何时形成价值对齐，发现SFT阶段主要建立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐这些价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会中作用日益重要，需要研究它们如何学习表达人类价值观，而现有工作多关注已训练模型的对齐效果，忽略了训练动态过程。

Method: 使用Llama-3和Qwen-3不同规模模型，结合流行的SFT和偏好优化数据集与算法，通过合成偏好数据集进行受控实验。

Result: SFT阶段通常确立模型价值观，后续偏好优化很少重新对齐；不同偏好优化算法即使使用相同偏好数据也会产生不同的价值对齐结果。

Conclusion: 研究为理解价值观在训练中的学习过程提供了实用见解，有助于指导数据筛选以及选择模型和算法来改进与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

TL;DR: AMO-Bench是一个高级数学推理基准测试，包含50道奥林匹克竞赛难度或更高的人类编写问题，旨在评估大型语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学竞赛基准测试对顶级LLMs的评估效果下降，存在性能饱和问题，需要更具挑战性的基准来推动模型发展。

Method: 创建50道经过专家交叉验证、达到IMO难度标准的原创问题，仅要求最终答案以便自动评分。

Result: 在26个LLMs上的实验显示，最佳模型准确率仅52.4%，大多数模型低于40%，但测试时计算量增加显示出有希望的扩展趋势。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在数学推理方面仍有很大改进空间，AMO-Bench的发布将促进语言模型推理能力的研究进展。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

TL;DR: Gistify是一个新的代码评估任务，要求编码LLM从完整代码库中提取特定功能的必要代码，生成一个最小化的独立文件来复现相同功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着编码代理在大型代码库中部署，需要自动设计具有挑战性的代码库级评估方法。

Method: 给编码LLM提供完整代码库访问权限和特定入口点，要求生成最小化、自包含的文件来复现相同命令的输出。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在可靠解决Gistify任务方面表现不佳，特别是对于执行轨迹较长的任务。

Conclusion: Gistify任务需要代码库结构理解、执行流准确建模和大代码补丁生成能力，现有模型在这方面仍有困难。

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了时空建模和空间注意力机制在水下目标检测中的有效性，通过比较YOLOv5、T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM模型，发现时空增强模型在复杂海洋环境中显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决水下目标检测在动态海洋环境中的挑战，如突然运动、部分遮挡和渐变运动，探索时空建模和注意力机制如何提升检测可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段评估T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能；第二阶段开发T-YOLOv5+CBAM模型，集成卷积块注意力模块来增强时空建模能力。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，T-YOLOv5和T-YOLOv5+CBAM分别达到0.813和0.811，在复杂场景中表现更优，但CBAM在简单场景中略有精度损失。

Conclusion: 时空建模显著提升水下目标检测精度，T-YOLOv5在动态环境中表现优异，而CBAM在挑战性场景中进一步改善性能，但在简单场景中需权衡精度损失。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练过程中直接让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，而不是事后选择图像，从而显著提升生成图像质量并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在大规模未筛选数据集上训练以实现多样化生成，但这与用户偏好不一致。事后奖励选择方法会丢弃信息数据，损害多样性、语义保真度和效率。

Method: 提出MIRO方法，在训练过程中让模型学习多个奖励模型的条件，直接学习用户偏好，而不是事后处理。

Result: MIRO在GenEval组合基准和用户偏好评分（PickAScore、ImageReward、HPSv2）上达到最先进性能，显著提升视觉质量并加速训练。

Conclusion: 通过训练时直接学习奖励模型条件，MIRO方法在保持多样性和语义保真度的同时，有效提升了生成图像质量和训练效率。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

Motivation: 解决扫描隧道显微镜(STM)中针尖退化和慢速串行数据采集的限制问题，减少针尖调节频率并提高实验吞吐量。

Method: 使用仅36张原始实验图像，通过物理信息合成数据生成管道训练最先进的流匹配和扩散模型，采用CLIP最大均值差异(CMMD)评分和结构相似性进行定量评估。

Result: 模型能有效修复图像，通过稀疏采样数据准确重建图像，实现2-4倍的图像采集时间减少。

Conclusion: 该框架有潜力显著提高STM实验吞吐量，减少针尖调节程序频率，并增强现有高速STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

Conclusion: 提出的流分解与聚合框架能够有效解决图像编辑中的反转不准确和梯度纠缠问题，在保持多样性的同时确保编辑输出的一致性。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的fMRI图像重建方法在忠实度方面存在不足，需要更有效的方法来准确重建人脑看到的图像。

Method: 采用脑交互变换器(BIT)架构，通过功能簇共享机制，预测高层语义特征和低层结构特征来引导扩散模型，实现从脑体素簇到图像特征的直接信息流动。

Result: 该方法在视觉和客观指标上均超越现有最佳方法，仅需1小时fMRI数据即可达到与40小时数据训练方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: Brain-IT通过脑启发的功能簇交互机制，实现了更忠实和高效的fMRI图像重建，为脑机接口提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Motivation: 解决在胸部腹部区域cine-MRI序列中实时肿瘤跟踪的挑战，特别是在强数据稀缺约束条件下。

Method: 探索了两种互补策略：无监督配准和基于基础模型的分割。最终选择SAM 2.1 b+模型，使用第一标注切片的掩码提示进行微调，采用1024x1024补丁、标准增强和平衡Dice+IoU损失，以低学习率训练300个epoch。

Result: 在TrackRAD2025挑战赛隐藏测试集上达到0.8794的Dice分数，总体排名第6位。

Conclusion: 基础模型在MRI引导放疗中实现准确实时肿瘤跟踪方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Mamba框架的方法，通过Hilbert选择性扫描机制增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，从而更有效地探索特征空间，提升低光图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba框架在特征空间探索方面存在局限，无法有效捕捉精细尺度的细节，存在信息不一致性问题，需要改进扫描机制来提升空间局部性和细节捕捉能力。

Method: 采用Hilbert选择性扫描机制来增加扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，这种机制能够更有效地探索特征空间，改善空间局部性，同时保持处理长距离依赖的能力。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有基于Mamba的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉质量，同时减少了计算资源消耗并缩短了推理时间。

Conclusion: 这种改进策略不仅推进了低光图像增强的最新技术水平，而且在更广泛的应用Mamba技术的领域中具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their

to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STAVEQ2架构，通过在视觉编码器中引入堆叠时间注意力模块，显著提升视频LLM的时间理解能力，在多个基准测试中性能提升达5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在理解复杂时间动态方面存在严重局限，难以处理需要详细理解动作序列和时间进程的任务。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入堆叠时间注意力模块，使模型在将视觉token传递给LLM之前能更好地捕捉动作进展和帧间关系。

Result: 该方法显著改善了时间推理能力，在视频问答任务特别是动作识别方面优于现有模型，在VITATECS、MVBench和Video-MME等基准上提升达5.5%。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时间结构，解决了视频LLM在视频理解中的关键差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于超声图像中骨骼区域的分割，只需5%的训练图像就能在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上实现稳健分割性能，优于现有方法1-27%的Dice系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决儿科肘部和手腕骨折超声图像分割中像素级专家标注耗时且成本高的问题，为轻训练用户提供实时反馈和关键结构突出显示。

Method: 提出FlexICL框架，采用视频内分割设置，专家仅标注少量帧，模型分割未见帧；系统研究图像拼接技术和训练策略，引入新颖拼接方法增强模型性能。

Result: 在1,252个超声扫描中，FlexICL比Painter、MAE-VQGAN等最先进视觉ICL模型以及U-Net、TransUNet等传统分割模型性能提升1-27% Dice系数。

Conclusion: FlexICL作为超声图像分割的高效可扩展解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的医学成像用例，具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的动态负提示方法，在去噪过程中自适应生成负提示，相比传统固定负提示方法能更好地提升文本-图像对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负提示方法使用固定的负提示，无法根据生成过程中的中间图像状态进行动态调整，限制了负引导的效果和灵活性。

Method: 在特定去噪步骤生成中间图像预测，然后查询VLM来生成上下文相关的负提示，实现动态负提示生成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上评估，展示了负引导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 动态负提示方法相比传统固定负提示方法能更有效地提升扩散模型的生成质量，在负引导强度和文本对齐之间实现更好的平衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PReMA是一种新型多模态攻击方法，通过仅修改输入图像（不改变文本提示）来操纵多模态扩散模型的输出内容，特别是生成NSFW内容，对图像编辑应用构成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态扩散模型在文本和图像模态之间的对齐不足，存在生成不当内容的风险，特别是在图像编辑应用中固定提示的情况下。

Method: 提出Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA)，通过创建对抗性图像来操纵模型输出，而不需要修改文本提示本身。

Result: 在图像修复和风格转换任务上的综合评估证实了PReMA的有效性，能够成功操纵各种模型的输出内容。

Conclusion: PReMA揭示了多模态扩散模型在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，特别是在固定提示的图像编辑场景中，需要加强安全防护措施。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频LLM在不同视角视频中是否能保持一致的时序理解能力，因为现实世界中同一事件常被多个视角记录。

Method: 引入EgoExo-Con基准，包含同步的自我中心和他者中心视频对，评估时序验证和时序定位任务；提出View-GRPO强化学习框架来增强跨视角一致性。

Result: 发现现有视频LLM跨视角一致性差，简单微调效果不佳；View-GRPO在提升跨视角一致性方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 跨视角时序理解是视频LLM的重要挑战，View-GRPO能有效改善模型在不同视角视频中的一致性表现。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文研究面临两大挑战：复杂的多步骤解释流程，以及信息组织和检索效率低下。学者需要花费大量时间搜索、整理和管理相关资源。

Method: 开发OracleAgent代理系统，整合多个甲骨文分析工具和LLM能力，构建包含140万单字拓片图像和8万条解释文本的多模态知识库，支持灵活的工具编排。

Result: 实验表明OracleAgent在多模态推理和生成任务中表现优异，超越主流MLLM模型（如GPT-4o），案例研究证实能显著降低甲骨文研究的时间成本。

Conclusion: OracleAgent为甲骨文辅助研究和自动化解释系统的实际部署迈出了重要一步，展示了在文化遗产保护领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态的统一框架，无需预校准输入，通过交替优化策略同时提升场景重建保真度和姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新视角合成方法依赖外部相机姿态估计工具如COLMAP，这会引入计算瓶颈和误差传播问题。

Method: 将联合优化解耦为两个交替阶段：固定姿态下通过可微分渲染更新3D高斯参数，以及使用定制的3D光流算法结合几何和光度约束来优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在重建质量上显著优于现有的无COLMAP技术，并且总体上超过了基于COLMAP的基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理具有大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的挑战性场景，逐步减少投影误差，提供了一种无需预校准输入的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Motivation: 当前端到端驾驶基准主要关注常规场景，无法充分测试系统在长尾场景下的真实潜力，且现有评估指标难以有效评估多模态驾驶性能。

Method: 构建了包含罕见长尾场景的WOD-E2E数据集（发生频率<0.03%），包含高级路由信息、自车状态和360度环视图像；提出了基于评分者偏好的RFS评估指标。

Result: 发布了包含4021个驾驶片段的WOD-E2E数据集，为验证集提供了评分者偏好标签，测试集标签用于2025年WOD-E2E挑战赛。

Conclusion: WOD-E2E数据集和RFS指标旨在推动可泛化、鲁棒且安全的端到端自动驾驶代理的研究，使其能够处理复杂的现实世界场景。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前将基于梯度的注意力信息直接集成到CNN表示中以进行语义对象理解的应用仍然有限，这种集成对于视觉任务（如SLAM）特别有益，因为富含空间注意力对象位置的CNN表示可以提升性能。

Method: 利用任务特定的网络注意力，将来自网络梯度的分层注意力信息与CNN特征表示相集成，以改进帧关联性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线方法相比性能有所提升，特别是在大型环境中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过集成基于梯度的注意力信息与CNN特征，可以有效提升RGB-D室内SLAM系统的性能，特别是在复杂大环境中的表现。

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Conclusion: FullPart通过结合隐式和显式表示的优势，有效解决了3D部件生成中的细节不足和尺寸不匹配问题，并发布了最大的PartVerse-XL数据集来推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM是一个针对可穿戴设备场景的多模态多轮对话RAG基准测试，包含6.5K个图像-问题-答案三元组和2K个多轮对话，涵盖13个领域，旨在评估多模态检索增强生成系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对可穿戴设备场景的全面多模态RAG基准测试，而智能眼镜等设备正改变人们与环境交互的方式，需要支持用户对视野中实体的信息查询。

Method: 构建包含6.2K个第一人称视角图像的多样化数据集，设计反映真实场景挑战的问题类型，包括图像质量问题、不同实体流行度、信息动态性等，并提供图像-KG检索和网页检索API。

Result: 现有RAG方法在单轮和多轮QA上的真实性分别仅为32%和43%，行业领先解决方案质量相似（32%/45%），表明有巨大改进空间。该基准已举办KDD Cup 2025，获胜方案将基线性能提升了28%。

Conclusion: CRAG-MM填补了可穿戴设备多模态RAG基准测试的空白，为评估和改进多模态对话系统提供了重要工具，展示了该领域仍有很大发展潜力。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

TL;DR: 提出MoTDiff框架，首次使用扩散模型从单张运动模糊图像中估计高分辨率运动轨迹，在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从单张模糊图像提取运动信息的方法（如模糊核和光流）质量较低，表现为粗粒度和不准确，需要高质量的运动轨迹估计。

Method: MoTDiff包含两个关键组件：1）使用从单张模糊图像提取的多尺度特征图作为条件的条件扩散框架；2）促进精确识别细粒度运动轨迹、一致估计运动路径整体形状位置以及沿轨迹像素连通性的新训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，MoTDiff在盲图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影应用中能够超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoTDiff是首个使用扩散模型从单张运动模糊图像估计高分辨率运动轨迹的框架，能够产生高质量的运动轨迹估计。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope是一个自动化框架，使用稀疏自编码器从视觉基础模型中发现和量化人类可解释的概念，用于分析数据集偏差、识别偏见并进行鲁棒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习数据集中普遍存在数据偏向某些概念的问题，但系统识别这些偏见需要昂贵的细粒度属性标注。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器在视觉基础模型表示上训练，将概念分类为目标、上下文和偏见类型，基于语义相关性和统计相关性进行数据集表征。

Result: 验证了ConceptScope能捕捉广泛的视觉概念，产生与语义相关图像区域对齐的空间归因，可靠检测已知偏见并发现未标注的新偏见。

Conclusion: ConceptScope为数据集审计和模型诊断提供了一个实用工具，能够自动发现和量化数据集中的概念偏差。

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Motivation: 解决传统素描到姿态估计方法因缺乏大规模素描-3D姿态标注数据而依赖耗时优化和启发式规则的问题，提升方法的泛化能力和效率。

Method: 使用扩散模型从3D人体姿态投影的2D姿态合成素描图像，创建SKEP-120K合成数据集；结合2D姿态检测器、生成扩散先验和前馈神经网络进行端到端框架设计；引入多种启发式损失函数保证几何一致性和自接触准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的"从合成中学习"策略和端到端数据驱动框架有效解决了素描到3D姿态估计的挑战，在精度和效率方面取得显著提升。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链可持续性对优化供应链绩效至关重要，风险管理是提升网络可持续性和供应链效率的基础问题，而正确的产品分类也是可持续供应链的关键要素。

Method: 使用新颖的几何深度网络提出集成深度网络Ch-EGN，这是一种混合卷积和几何深度学习的方法，利用供应链中的信息依赖关系来推导数据库中样本的不可见状态。

Result: 在DataCo供应链上实现风险管理的平均准确率为98.95%；在SupplyGraph数据库上，5种产品组分类准确率100%，4种产品关系分类准确率98.07%，25种公司关系分类准确率92.37%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法相比现有最先进方法具有平均改进和效率提升，验证了其在供应链风险管理和可持续性方面的有效性。

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniLayout-1M数据集和OmniLayout-LLM模型，解决了文档布局生成领域数据稀缺和复杂布局生成困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档AI发展迅速，但主要集中在文档布局分析，而文档布局生成研究不足。主要障碍在于缺乏多样化的布局数据，现有研究多集中于学术论文的曼哈顿式结构，而报纸、杂志等开放世界类型的文档布局严重不足。

Method: 提出OmniLayout-LLM模型（0.5B参数），采用两阶段粗到细学习范式：1）从OmniLayout-1M数据集中学习通用布局原则（粗粒度类别定义）；2）将知识迁移到具有细粒度标注的特定领域。

Result: 在M$^{6}$Doc数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域都取得了强劲性能，显著超越了现有的布局生成专家模型和几个最新的通用大语言模型。

Conclusion: OmniLayout-1M是首个百万规模的多样化文档布局数据集，OmniLayout-LLM模型通过两阶段学习范式有效解决了复杂领域布局生成问题，代码、模型和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在多模态任务表现出色，但对视频中时间信息的理解和评估不足，特别是判断时间方向的能力存在明显缺陷。

Method: 引入AoT-PsyPhyBENCH基准，使用与人类行为研究相同的刺激物，系统评估开放权重和专有模型在判断视频正反向播放时的表现。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近随机水平，即使在物理不可逆过程（如自由落体、扩散/爆炸）和因果手动动作上，最佳模型也远落后于人类准确率。

Conclusion: 当前多模态系统缺乏时间连续性和因果理解的归纳偏置，需要进一步提升物理和时间推理能力。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法在模态信息平衡方面存在困境，生成式融合方法的数据分布学习能力有限，且模态信息选择缺乏可解释性，影响复杂场景下的可靠性和一致性。

Method: 1. 多尺度掩码调控变分瓶颈编码器：通过后验概率建模和信息分解提取准确简洁的低级模态信息；2. 时变物理引导机制：将扩散模型的概率生成能力与物理规律结合，自适应调控生成过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量评估中达到最先进的融合性能，显著提升了语义分割指标，证明了该方法在增强结构一致性和细节质量方面的优势。

Conclusion: 从人类认知规律出发的生成式图像融合方法能有效提升结构一致性和细节质量，为红外与可见光图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Result: ResNet50单独表现最佳，但三种网络融合能显著提升性能，在UBIPr数据库上达到了新的最优水平。热图显示不同网络关注图像的不同区域，解释了它们的互补性。

Conclusion: 不同CNN架构在虹膜验证中具有互补性，通过适当的融合策略可以显著提升系统性能，为远距离生物识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法存在模式坍塌问题，无法生成多样化轨迹假设；而现有生成方法难以在生成过程中直接融入安全和物理约束，需要额外优化阶段来修正输出。

Method: 采用约束流匹配方法，显式地将约束直接集成到流匹配过程中，确保生成的轨迹符合安全和运动学规则，并将驾驶激进程度参数化为生成过程中的控制信号。

Conclusion: CATG框架通过约束流匹配有效解决了自动驾驶规划中的模式坍塌和约束集成问题，能够生成多样化且符合安全要求的轨迹，同时支持轨迹风格的精确控制。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

Motivation: 眼周区域具有高区分性和最小采集约束，但现有研究通常依赖小规模数据集（仅数千张图像）进行训练，本文旨在使用大规模数据集评估CNN架构在眼周识别中的有效性。

Method: 使用三种不同深度和复杂度的卷积神经网络架构，在从VGGFace2数据库提取的1,907,572张眼部图像上进行训练，并在VGGFace2-Pose和UFPR-Periocular数据库上进行实验评估。

Result: 在VGGFace2-Pose上，眼部图像的EER为9-15%，明显高于全脸图像的3-6%；在UFPR-Periocular上取得了1-2%的EER，是目前该数据集上报告的最低错误率。

Conclusion: 使用大规模数据集训练CNN可以有效提升眼周生物识别性能，图像质量和采集协议的一致性对识别准确率有显著影响，UFPR-Periocular由于更高质量图像和一致采集协议表现最佳。

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于证据理论的混合模型，有效融合CNN和ViT的特征来提升糖尿病视网膜病变诊断性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一CNN或ViT的DR诊断方法性能已达瓶颈，需要整合不同骨干网络的各自优势（CNN的局部特征提取能力和ViT的全局特征捕获能力）

Method: 基于证据理论的特征融合范式，通过深度证据网络将不同骨干网络的特征转换为支持证据，形成聚合意见来自适应调整融合模式

Result: 在两个公开DR分级数据集上验证，相比现有最优框架提高了DR分级准确性，同时提供了优秀的特征融合和决策可解释性

Conclusion: 提出的证据融合混合模型不仅提升了DR诊断性能，还增强了模型的可解释性，为医学图像分析提供了新思路

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR是一个视觉语言引导的扩散框架，专门针对场景文本超分辨率，通过结合OCR引导和场景感知优化，在保持视觉质量的同时显著提升文本可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法主要优化失真或感知指标，对字符级错误不敏感，而场景文本（如标志、标签）往往包含最关键信息。现有研究要么忽视文本特殊性，要么在简化基准上测试，无法应对复杂自然场景中的文本恢复挑战。

Method: 使用文本-SR融合控制网络（TS-ControlNet）结合OCR数据引导，采用乒乓调度器在文本中心和场景中心指导之间交替。在合成语料库上训练这些组件，同时保持主SR分支冻结。

Result: 在SVT、SCUT-CTW1500和CUTE80数据集上，4倍和8倍超分辨率时，GLYPH-SR相比扩散/GAN基线将OCR F1分数提升高达15.18个百分点（SVT x8，OpenOCR），同时保持竞争力的MANIQA、CLIP-IQA和MUSIQ分数。

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR能够同时实现高可读性和高视觉真实感，提供既看起来正确又能正确阅读的超分辨率结果，满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG驱动的图像重建方法往往忽视空间注意力机制，限制了保真度和语义连贯性。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器(ATM)提取EEG特征，通过低秩适应(LoRA)微调Stable Diffusion 2.1，结合ControlNet分支进行空间显著性图条件生成。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上评估，在低层和高层图像特征质量上显著优于现有方法，同时与人类视觉注意力高度一致。

Conclusion: 注意力先验解决了EEG的模糊性，实现了高保真重建，在医疗诊断和神经自适应接口中有应用前景，通过预训练扩散模型的高效适应推进了神经解码。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了LoCoT2V-Bench基准，专门用于评估复杂输入条件下的长视频生成，包含现实复杂提示和多维度评估框架，发现现有方法在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成评估主要关注简化提示和低级指标，忽视了与提示的细粒度对齐以及叙事连贯性、主题表达等抽象维度，特别是在长视频生成方面存在评估挑战。

Method: 基于真实世界视频构建包含场景转换和事件动态的现实复杂提示，并建立多维度评估框架，包括新提出的指标：事件级对齐、细粒度时间一致性、内容清晰度以及关注叙事流程、情感响应和角色发展的人类期望实现度。

Result: 对9个代表性长视频生成模型进行综合评估，发现当前方法在基本视觉和时间方面表现良好，但在事件间一致性、细粒度对齐和高级主题遵循等方面存在困难。

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长格式复杂文本到视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指明了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时提示调优方法在文本特征分散性方面存在不足，导致校准性能不佳，影响模型的可靠性、可信度和安全性。

Method: 引入角度多样性概念，通过在单位超球面上最大化归一化文本特征之间的最小成对角度距离来实现特征分布的均匀性。

Result: 在多种骨干网络和数据集上的实验表明，A-TPT在降低聚合平均校准误差方面优于现有方法，同时保持相当的准确性，在自然分布偏移和医学数据集上表现出优异的零样本校准性能。

Conclusion: 促进角度多样性是实现良好分散文本特征的有效方法，能显著改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应过程中的校准性能。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出PointSt3R方法，通过3D基础对应关系将DUSt3R和MASt3R等3D重建模型适应于点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪方面取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用先进的3D重建模型在静态场景中的2D和3D对应能力，将其扩展到点跟踪任务，特别是处理动态点跟踪问题。

Method: 结合重建损失与动态对应训练，添加可见性头，使用少量合成数据微调MASt3R模型，仅使用包含查询点的帧对进行训练和评估。

Result: 在四个数据集上取得竞争性或更优的点跟踪结果：TAP-Vid-DAVIS（73.8 δ_avg / 85.8%遮挡准确率），EgoPoints（61.3 vs 54.2），RGB-S（87.0 vs 82.8），显著优于CoTracker3。

Conclusion: PointSt3R方法成功将3D重建模型适应于点跟踪任务，在静态和动态点跟踪方面都表现出色，证明了3D基础对应关系的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义描述来解决小样本异常检测中的语义对齐问题，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上取得了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏详细文本描述，只能使用预定义的图像级描述来匹配视觉补丁，导致图像描述与补丁级视觉异常之间的语义错位，定位性能不佳。

Method: 提出多级细粒度语义描述(MFSC)自动构建多级细粒度文本描述，包含多级可学习提示(MLLP)和多级语义对齐(MLSA)两个组件。MLLP通过自动替换和连接机制将细粒度语义融入多级可学习提示，MLSA设计区域聚合策略和多级对齐训练。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集的小样本设置下，FineGrainedAD实现了优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过提供多级细粒度语义描述和相应的对齐机制，显著提升了小样本异常检测的定位性能。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的对象-上下文捷径问题会削弱模型在测试场景与训练共现模式不同时的可靠性，这被重新构建为因果推理问题。

Method: 在CLIP表示空间中估计对象和背景期望，通过将对象特征与来自外部数据集、批次邻居或文本描述的不同上下文重新组合来合成反事实嵌入，通过估计总直接效应和模拟干预来减去仅背景激活。

Result: 无需重新训练或提示设计，该方法在上下文敏感基准测试中显著提高了最差组和平均准确率，建立了新的零样本最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的表示级反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 发现LVLM在自改进过程中存在马太效应：模型擅长生成简单查询的高质量轨迹，但在复杂查询上表现不佳，导致优化偏向简单推理技能，阻碍复杂推理能力发展。

Method: 提出四种高效策略：分布重塑和轨迹重采样两个角度，在探索-学习自改进过程中实现头尾数据再平衡。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct和InternVL2.5-4B模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续提升视觉推理能力，平均比原始自改进方法高出3.86分。

Conclusion: 通过头尾再平衡策略有效缓解了自改进过程中的马太效应，突破了性能瓶颈，显著提升了LVLM的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

Motivation: 传统手动剪辑广告视频耗时耗力，需要为同一广告活动制作不同时长的多个版本。现有视频摘要方法主要关注视觉内容，而忽视了音频在广告中的关键作用。

Method: 将视频剪辑定义为镜头选择问题，开发双流音视频融合模型预测帧重要性，其中重要性定义为帧被选入公司制作的短广告的可能性。创建了AdSum204数据集（102对30秒和15秒广告）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了自动化视频广告剪辑，强调了音频在广告中的重要性，并通过音视频融合模型取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH是一个即插即用的跨域适应框架，通过解耦视觉和语言适应，使用轻量级模块提升VQA模型在遥感、医疗、数学等领域的泛化能力，无需重新训练主干模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感、医疗、数学等跨域场景中泛化能力显著下降。现有方法依赖领域特定微调或定制流程，成本高、灵活性差且难以扩展。

Method: 引入两个轻量级模块：领域分类器识别图像类型，双适配器机制（提示适配器用于语言调制，视觉适配器用于视觉特征调整），通过统一钩子接口动态注入，无需重新训练主干模型。

Result: 在四个领域特定VQA基准测试中取得一致性能提升：MathVQA +2.3 BLEU，MedVQA-RAD +2.6 VQA，ChartQA +3.1 ROUGE。

Conclusion: CATCH为多域VQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，支持在不同应用领域的实际部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Emu3.5是一个大规模多模态世界模型，通过统一的下一标记预测目标在超过10万亿标记的视觉-语言交织数据上进行预训练，能够自然处理交织的视觉-语言输入和输出。模型通过离散扩散适应技术加速推理，在图像生成、编辑和多模态推理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能够原生预测视觉和语言下一状态的多模态世界模型，实现长程视觉-语言生成、任意到图像生成等复杂任务，并具备可泛化的世界建模能力。

Method: 采用端到端预训练，使用统一的下一标记预测目标在视觉-语言交织数据上训练；通过大规模强化学习进行后训练增强多模态推理；提出离散扩散适应技术将逐标记解码转换为双向并行预测，加速推理。

Conclusion: Emu3.5展示了强大的原生多模态能力，通过统一的建模方法和高效的推理技术，在多模态生成和世界建模任务上取得显著成果，为社区研究提供了开源支持。

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching是一种基于引导条件流匹配的计算超分辨率方法，在荧光显微镜图像处理中实现了数据保真度和感知真实性的最佳平衡，并能提供像素级不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算超分辨率是一个不适定问题，需要找到能够外推显微镜图像中未成像频率的先验。随着数据驱动机器学习技术的发展，可以学习更强的先验来获得更好的超分辨率结果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配来学习改进的数据先验，能够从隐式学习的后验分布中采样，并提供像素级数据不确定性估计。

Result: 在BioSR数据集的4个不同生物结构上评估，与7个基线方法相比，ResMatching在所有情况下都实现了竞争性的结果，特别是在噪声较多的低分辨率图像中表现优异。

Conclusion: ResMatching在计算超分辨率中特别有效，能够提供校准的不确定性估计，帮助用户拒绝不确定的预测。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对事件相机的标记化方法Spiking Patches，能够保持事件的异步性和空间稀疏性，在保持精度的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将事件表示为帧或体素，虽然精度高但破坏了事件相机的异步性和空间稀疏性特性。需要一种能保持这些独特属性的表示方法。

Method: 使用Spiking Patches标记器对异步稀疏事件流进行标记化处理，然后在手势识别和物体检测任务上使用GNN、PCN和Transformer进行评估。

Result: Spiking Patches标记比基于体素的标记推理速度快3.4倍，比帧表示快10.4倍，同时保持相同精度，在某些情况下精度还有提升（手势识别提升3.8%，物体检测提升1.4%）。

Conclusion: 标记化为事件视觉提供了新方向，是朝着保持事件相机特性的方法迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module
to enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the
Median-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the
model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 首次大规模评估48个深度学习光流模型在RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像上的表现，多个模型达到亚公里级精度，证明深度学习方法可有效应用于极地遥感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰漂移准确估计对北极导航、气候研究和业务预报至关重要。计算机视觉中的光流技术在海冰遥感中的应用尚待探索。

Method: 使用48个深度学习光流模型处理RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像，通过与GNSS跟踪浮标对比评估端点误差和Fl指标。

Result: 多个模型达到亚公里级精度（EPE 6-8像素，300-400米），能够捕捉一致的区域漂移模式，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习光流方法可有效迁移到极地遥感，提供空间连续的漂移场，为导航和气候建模提供新机遇。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM是一个轻量级转向模块，通过动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接，实现对视觉语言模型的细粒度推理时控制，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在遵循复杂指令方面存在不足，需要一种能够在不影响其他任务性能的前提下，实现对模型输出的精确控制方法。

Method: 从编码目标行为和相反行为的配对提示的潜在嵌入中学习，通过维度激活调制和跨层自适应转向，动态调整语言模态与图像上下文之间的激活连接。

Result: SteerVLM在转向和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，仅需原始VLM大小0.14%的学习参数，同时保持非目标任务的性能。

Conclusion: SteerVLM通过激活工程为多模态模型控制提供了稳健解决方案，并引入了VNIA数据集来支持VLM转向技术的开发和评估。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的分层运动建模方法，通过图学习直接从数据中学习结构化的、可解释的运动关系，将全局绝对运动分解为父级继承模式和局部运动残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动定义或启发式的分层结构，使用固定的运动基元，限制了在不同任务间的泛化能力。需要一种能够直接从数据中学习运动层次结构的通用方法。

Method: 使用基于图的分层表示，将层次推断构建为可微图学习问题，顶点表示基本运动，有向边通过图神经网络捕获学习的父子依赖关系。

Result: 在1D平移运动、2D旋转运动和3D高斯溅射场景变形三个示例上验证，成功重建了1D和2D案例的内在运动层次，在动态3D高斯溅射场景上相比基线产生了更真实和可解释的变形。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个适应性强、数据驱动的分层建模范式，适用于广泛的运动中心任务。

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了一个从视频生成向3D人体运动生成转移知识的综合框架，包括ViMoGen-228K大规模数据集、ViMoGen扩散变换器模型和MBench评估基准，显著提升了运动生成的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型在泛化能力上存在瓶颈，而视频生成领域在建模人类行为方面表现出卓越的泛化能力，因此探索将视频生成的知识转移到运动生成领域。

Method: 1)构建ViMoGen-228K大规模数据集，整合高质量光学动捕数据、网络视频语义标注动作和视频生成模型合成样本；2)提出基于流匹配的扩散变换器ViMoGen，通过门控多模态条件统一动捕数据和视频生成模型的先验；3)开发轻量版ViMoGen-light消除视频生成依赖；4)建立MBench分层评估基准。

Conclusion: 通过系统地从视频生成向运动生成转移知识，成功突破了3D人体运动生成的泛化瓶颈，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球尺度图像地理定位的挑战：标准图像检索方法效率低且覆盖率不足，现有方法存在粗粒度定位（10+公里）或局限于小区域的问题。

Method: 使用代理分类任务训练学习丰富特征表示，结合航拍图像嵌入提高对地面数据稀疏性的鲁棒性，实现跨多国的直接细粒度检索。

Result: 在覆盖欧洲大部分地区的数据集上，68%的查询能在200米范围内精确定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在大地理范围内实现了细粒度地理定位，解决了现有方法的局限性，代码已公开。

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D是一个无需姿态标注的视频到4D内容生成框架，通过虚拟相机渲染和视图条件视频修复，实现了从随意视频中合成时空4D内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到4D方法依赖手动标注的相机姿态，成本高且对野外视频不鲁棒。warp-then-inpaint方法虽无需姿态标签，但轨迹到轨迹的表述容易混淆相机运动与场景动态。

Method: 采用轨迹到相机的框架，用固定虚拟相机库替代显式轨迹预测，分离相机控制与场景建模。训练视图条件视频修复模型学习几何先验，通过时空自回归推理管道在虚拟相机样条上生成连贯内容。

Result: 在跨视图视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中，SEE4D在定量指标和定性评估上均优于基于姿态或轨迹的基线方法，展现出更好的泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: SEE4D推进了从随意视频进行实用4D世界建模的能力，无需显式3D标注，实现了相机控制与场景建模的分离。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为掩码扩散字幕（MDC）的方法，通过图像条件掩码扩散语言模型学习视觉特征，在图像字幕任务中训练视觉特征提取器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归字幕方法中视觉学习信号的强度依赖于标记在序列中的位置，需要辅助目标。MDC旨在减少这种依赖性，提供更均匀的视觉学习信号。

Method: 在训练过程中，随机掩码图像字幕对中的文本标记，然后使用基于视觉特征的条件解码器重建原始文本。通过扩散模型学习视觉表示。

Result: 在各种学术规模模型和数据集上的线性探测实验表明，MDC学习的视觉特征与自回归和对比方法产生的特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散字幕是一种有效的视觉特征学习方法，不需要辅助目标就能产生有竞争力的视觉表示，为视觉语言模型提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Motivation: 现有2D提升方法主要关注外观生成而忽略内在属性感知，需要推进全景技术以生成适用于物理渲染、重光照和仿真的图形就绪3D场景。

Method: 基于轻量高效的跨模态适配器结构，重新利用2D生成先验进行全景几何、纹理和PBR材质感知，构建大规模合成全景数据集。

Result: 实验证明模型在全景视觉感知和图形就绪3D场景生成方面有效，为沉浸式和物理真实虚拟世界生成开辟新可能。

Conclusion: OmniX框架成功实现了从2D生成先验到图形就绪3D场景的转换，推进了全景技术在物理真实虚拟环境生成中的应用。

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Motivation: 评估视频生成模型是否具备作为零样本推理器在复杂视觉推理场景中应用的能力，系统分析其推理行为的优势和不足。

Method: 通过构建MME-CoF基准数据集，在12个维度上对Veo-3模型进行系统性评估，包括空间、几何、物理、时间和具身逻辑等方面。

Result: 视频模型在短时空间连贯性、细粒度定位和局部一致动态方面表现出有前景的推理模式，但在长时因果推理、严格几何约束和抽象逻辑方面存在明显限制。

Conclusion: 当前视频模型尚不能作为可靠的独立零样本推理器，但作为专用推理模型的补充视觉引擎具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Motivation: 传统交通事件检测方法存在检测与验证分离、灵活性有限、基础设施依赖性强等问题，难以适应变化的交通事故热点区域。

Method: 集成无人机的高机动性和空中视角进行自适应监控，使用热成像技术提升低能见度性能和隐私保护，采用轻量级深度学习框架实时提取车辆轨迹并检测事件。

Result: 在自收集数据集上达到99%的检测准确率，在佛罗里达州75号州际公路实地测试中，比当地交通管理中心提前12分钟检测到追尾事故，并能监控事故引发的拥堵传播。

Conclusion: DARTS系统为实现更灵活、集成的实时交通事件检测系统迈出了重要一步，具有提高交通管理运营效率和响应能力的潜力，特别是在偏远地区和资源受限环境中具有可扩展性和成本效益。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于单目相机的自定位通常使用CNN提取局部特征，但在存在动态障碍物（如行人）时效果不佳

Method: 将CNN与Vision Transformer结合，CNN提取局部特征，Vision Transformer提取全局特征（图像块间关系）

Result: 在CG数据集上，有动态障碍物时的精度提升率比无动态障碍物时高1.5倍；在公开数据集上自定位误差比SOTA减少20.1%；机器人平均定位误差7.51cm，优于SOTA

Conclusion: 结合CNN和Vision Transformer的方法能有效应对动态障碍物，显著提高自定位精度

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that
lead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation
Benchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified
benchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.
ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and
privacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation
scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal
the limitations of existing approaches in large-scale webpage recommendation
and highlight the potential for improvements with LLM integrations. ORBIT

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

### [134] [StructLayoutFormer:Conditional Structured Layout Generation via Structure Serialization and Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26141)
*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出StructLayoutFormer，一种基于Transformer的条件结构化布局生成方法，通过结构序列化和结构信息解耦，首次实现数据驱动的显式结构化布局生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化布局在2D视觉内容中很重要，但现有数据驱动方法只能生成固定布局而无法产生布局结构，需要手动提取结构信息。

Method: 使用结构序列化方案将结构化布局表示为序列，将结构信息与元素位置解耦，基于Transformer架构进行条件生成。

Result: 在条件结构化布局生成任务中超越了现有基线方法，并能有效提取和传输布局结构。

Conclusion: StructLayoutFormer是首个实现条件结构化布局生成的数据驱动方法，能够显式生成真实的布局结构。

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is
publicly available at %\href{https://github.com/Teagrus/StructLayoutFormer}

*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC是一种用于大型视觉语言模型持续组合知识编辑的新方法，通过双外部记忆和双LoRA适配器实现视觉和文本知识的组合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法通常只关注单一模态，忽视了LVLMs的多模态特性和知识更新的连续性，导致编辑效果不理想。

Method: 采用混合外部-内部编辑器，包含双外部记忆用于跨模态证据检索，双LoRA适配器实现模态解耦参数更新，以及选择性激活的脑启发知识连接器。

Result: 实验表明MemEIC在复杂多模态问题上显著提升性能，并能有效保持先前的编辑结果。

Conclusion: MemEIC为LVLMs的持续组合知识编辑设定了新的基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SPECS框架，通过自蒸馏生成偏好数据对，使用偏好训练方法进行冷启动，优于传统的SFT方法，在多个多模态基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT冷启动方法将推理范式与任务解决方案和输出格式交织，可能导致指令风格过拟合，削弱分布外泛化能力，并影响下游强化学习。

Method: SPECS框架：1) 通过自蒸馏生成内省偏好数据对；2) 进行偏好训练，专注于浅层、可转移的表面形式标准；3) 将学习结果传递给具有可验证奖励的强化学习进行深度推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SPECS框架相比强基线获得一致性能提升，MEGA-Bench提升4.1%，MathVista提升12.2%。

Conclusion: SPECS框架通过解耦多模态学习，减少了分布内"卡顿"，改善了探索能力，稳定了训练过程，并提高了性能上限。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了知识蒸馏对模型去偏能力的影响，发现在NLI和图像分类任务中，知识蒸馏会削弱模型的去偏能力，并提出三种改进方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏在模型压缩和知识迁移方面很有效，但其对模型抗伪相关鲁棒性的影响尚未充分探索，特别是在处理分布外数据时的去偏能力。

Method: 通过在自然语言推理和图像分类任务上进行大量实验，分析知识蒸馏前后模型的去偏能力变化，并识别内部注意力模式和电路。

Result: 主要发现：(i)知识蒸馏后模型去偏能力下降；(ii)训练去偏模型时注入教师知识无益；(iii)模型整体鲁棒性稳定但不同偏见的鲁棒性差异显著；(iv)识别出导致知识蒸馏后不同行为的内部注意力模式和电路。

Conclusion: 提出了三种改进知识蒸馏可蒸馏性的方案：开发高质量数据增强、实施迭代知识蒸馏、用教师模型权重初始化学生模型。这是首个大规模研究知识蒸馏对去偏影响及其内部机制的工作。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: 提出CorVS方法，通过视觉跟踪轨迹与传感器测量之间的对应关系进行人员识别，适用于工业场景下的工人定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在物流仓库等工业场景中，工人定位数据对提高生产力至关重要。虽然摄像头能提供有价值的环境信息，但仅靠视觉数据识别个体通常不切实际。现有方法在真实世界条件下可能失效。

Method: 1. 深度学习模型预测轨迹与传感器测量对的对应概率和可靠性；2. 算法使用预测的概率和可靠性随时间匹配轨迹和传感器测量。

Result: 开发了实际仓库操作的数据集，证明了该方法在真实世界应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: CorVS方法通过结合视觉跟踪和传感器数据，能够有效解决工业场景下的人员识别问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了序列建模中参数化记忆的几何视角，挑战了传统的关联存储观点。研究发现Transformer模型会自发形成几何结构来编码全局实体关系，即使这种几何结构并不比暴力查找关联更简洁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，序列建模中的参数化记忆被抽象为实体共现的暴力查找。作者希望探索记忆是否以几何形式存储，特别是当模型需要处理训练数据中未共现的实体关系时。

Method: 通过分析Transformer推理的清晰实例，研究模型如何合成原子事实的几何结构。同时分析Node2Vec的连接，揭示几何结构源于谱偏置。

Result: 发现Transformer模型确实形成了编码全局实体关系的几何结构，即使在没有各种压力的情况下也会自然产生。这种几何结构将复杂的推理任务简化为易于学习的几何任务。

Conclusion: 参数化记忆的几何视角鼓励重新审视知识获取、容量、发现和遗忘等领域的默认直觉，并为实践者提供了使Transformer记忆更具几何性的改进空间。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Motivation: 当前AI在学术基准测试上表现优异，但这些进步如何转化为实际经济价值和自动化能力尚不清楚，需要建立能够衡量AI在实际工作场景中表现的评估标准。

Method: 引入远程劳动指数(RLI)，这是一个多领域的基准测试，包含真实世界中有经济价值的项目，用于评估AI代理在实践环境中的端到端性能。

Result: AI代理在RLI上的表现接近最低水平，表现最好的代理自动化率仅为2.5%，表明AI在实际经济任务中的自动化能力仍非常有限。

Conclusion: RLI为讨论AI自动化提供了实证基础，建立了跟踪AI影响的共同标准，帮助利益相关者主动应对AI驱动的劳动力自动化趋势。

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable
projects designed to evaluate end-to-end agent performance in practical

TL;DR: 研究发现BF16浮点精度在RL微调中引入的舍入误差是训练与推理策略不匹配的根本原因，改用FP16可有效解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型RL微调中因训练与推理策略数值不匹配导致的不稳定性问题。

Method: 将浮点精度从BF16改为FP16，仅需几行代码修改，无需改变模型架构或学习算法。

Result: 使用FP16能实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度，并在多种任务、算法和框架中表现更优。

Conclusion: FP16在RL微调中比BF16更有效，建议重新考虑精度权衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前世界模型在长期预测中表现脆弱，主要原因是表示质量差：高维外部感知输入和损失/纠缠的潜在表示使动态学习变得困难。研究是否仅通过改进表示学习就能显著提升世界模型性能。

Method: GRWM方法在潜在表示空间中强制自然感官轨迹上的连续点保持几何接近性，这是一种即插即用的几何正则化方法，只需最小架构修改，与多种潜在生成主干兼容。

Result: 在确定性3D环境和长时程预测任务中，GRWM显著提高了推演保真度和稳定性，学习到具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。

Conclusion: 改进表示学习是构建鲁棒世界模型的直接有效途径，能够在无需扩大动态模块的情况下实现可靠的长期预测。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

TL;DR: 提出人机协作框架，从仅标签标注中推断思维轨迹，通过拒绝采样方法重构思维轨迹，用于微调开源LLM评估器和改进专有LLM评估器的标注指南，显著提升LLM与人类评估的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器的可靠性在主观任务中有限，人类判断涉及超越标注标签的细微推理，思维轨迹信息丰富但难以收集和整理。

Method: 使用人机协作框架和简单有效的拒绝采样方法，从仅标签标注中大规模重构思维轨迹，应用于微调开源LLM评估器和合成更清晰的专有LLM评估器标注指南。

Result: 在多个数据集上，方法显著提高了LLM与人类评估的一致性，改进的标注指南增加了不同LLM模型间的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为人类思维轨迹的实用代理，使仅标签语料库扩展为思维轨迹增强资源，从而提高LLM评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模多样化的基于角色的偏好，为LLM评判者的校准提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在LLMs中主要关注数学和代码领域，缺乏跨领域的通用推理能力训练

Method: 两阶段课程学习：阶段1在数学领域进行RL训练，阶段2在混合领域进行联合RL训练以迁移和巩固推理技能

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和Llama-3.1-8B上的多领域评估显示一致性能提升，认知技能分析表明数学优先训练能增强解决复杂问题的重要认知行为

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum提供了一个紧凑、易于采用的通用推理训练方案，两个阶段都是必要的

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

Motivation: 在工具学习领域，缺乏专门为函数调用任务设计的奖励模型，限制了智能代理AI的发展。

Method: 提出基于规则评分和多维采样的新流程构建成对偏好数据，创建ToolPref-Pairwise-30K数据集，并在Qwen3-4B/8B系列模型上训练ToolRM。

Conclusion: ToolRM不仅改进了训练目标，还能泛化到更广泛的评判任务，为工具学习研究提供了有效的数据和模型资源。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大语言模型在规范推理领域的能力，发现虽然LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在不一致性，并表现出类似人类推理的认知偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范推理涉及义务、许可等模态逻辑，虽然LLMs在各种推理任务中表现出色，但其处理规范推理的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 从逻辑和模态角度评估LLMs的规范推理能力，通过比较规范模态和认知模态的推理，引入包含广泛形式推理模式的新数据集，并纳入影响人类推理的非形式认知因素。

Result: LLMs总体上遵循有效推理模式，但在特定类型的规范推理中存在显著不一致性，并表现出与人类推理相似的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了在LLMs的规范推理中实现逻辑一致性所面临的挑战，为增强其可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: 实现智能体组织新时代，让智能体通过协作并发解决复杂问题，超越个体智能局限。

Method: 提出异步思维协议，组织者动态分配子查询给工作者，合并中间知识；通过强化学习优化思维结构。

Result: 相比并行思维降低28%推理延迟，提升数学推理准确率；学习到的异步思维能力可泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 异步思维是有效的并发推理范式，能显著提升推理效率并保持准确性，具备良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Motivation: 建立与基础设施无关的基准来评估当代基础模型的推理能力，验证不同计算平台上的可重复性，并为教育、生产和研究环境中的模型选择提供指导。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法：1) 在MareNostrum 5上建立6个模型的基线；2) 在大学集群和Nebius AI Studio上验证基础设施无关的可重复性；3) 在两个平台上对79个问题进行扩展评估。

Result: 研究结果挑战了传统的缩放假设，确立了训练数据质量比模型规模更关键，并为不同应用场景的模型选择提供了可操作的指导方针。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3

reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: DySQL-Bench是一个评估多轮交互式Text-to-SQL系统性能的新基准，通过自动化流水线生成任务，模拟真实场景中用户意图动态变化的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL系统在静态单轮任务中表现良好，但在真实交互场景中用户意图会动态演变，需要模型能够适应多轮查询优化。

Method: 采用两阶段自动化流水线：基于数据库表结构生成任务，然后进行交互导向的过滤和专家验证。构建了包含1072个任务的基准，涵盖13个领域。

Result: 人类评估确认合成数据的100%正确性。GPT-4o在基准上仅达到58.34%总体准确率和23.81%的Pass@5指标，显示基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: DySQL-Bench填补了交互式Text-to-SQL评估的空白，揭示了现有模型在动态场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero是一个完全客户端、跨平台的浏览器扩展，能够在用户滚动时实时标记Facebook和X平台上的不可靠帖子，所有计算都在本地进行，保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体以空前速度传播信息，同时也加速了错误信息的传播，威胁公共讨论。需要开发能够在保护用户隐私的同时有效检测虚假信息的工具。

Method: 采用三阶段训练课程：基线微调、域自适应训练（结合焦点损失、对抗增强和后训练量化）。使用DistilBERT-Quant和TinyBERT-Quant模型在本地进行DOM抓取、标记化、Transformer推理和UI渲染。

Result: 在239,000条帖子的数据集上，DistilBERT-Quant模型（67.6 MB）达到97.1%宏F1、97.4%准确率和0.996 AUROC，中位延迟约103毫秒。TinyBERT-Quant变体（14.7 MB）保持95.7%宏F1和96.1%准确率，延迟降至约40毫秒。

Conclusion: FakeZero证明在严格资源预算下实现高质量假新闻检测是可行的，通过提供内联可信度提示，可作为遏制社交媒体错误信息传播的有价值工具，并为研究人员收集大规模假新闻数据集开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIRAJ是一个通用的红队测试框架，用于发现黑盒LLM代理的安全漏洞。它采用动态两步流程：首先生成多样化的种子测试用例，然后基于执行轨迹迭代构建和优化对抗攻击。通过模型蒸馏方法，训练出更小但同样有效的红队模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理规划和调用工具的能力带来了新的安全风险，需要全面的红队测试系统来发现漏洞，确保安全部署。

Method: 采用动态两步流程：1) 从代理定义生成多样化种子测试用例；2) 基于先前执行轨迹迭代构建和优化模型对抗攻击。使用模型蒸馏方法，利用教师模型的结构化推理训练更小的模型。

Result: 种子测试用例生成方法使风险结果和工具调用轨迹覆盖率提高2-2.5倍。蒸馏的8B红队模型攻击成功率提升100%，超越671B Deepseek-R1模型。

Conclusion: SIRAJ框架在多样化评估代理设置中验证了其有效性，包括迭代框架、结构化推理和红队模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM水印方案存在信任问题：非公开的水印检测无法证明其忠实执行检测过程。密钥管理面临两难：公开密钥易被攻击者利用进行移除攻击，私有密钥则使检测过程不透明。

Method: 基于零知识证明构建PVMark插件，通过构建水印检测'正确执行'的证明，包括映射、随机数生成、比较和求和等ZKP约束。实现了三种水印方案、三种哈希函数和四种ZKP协议的多重组合变体。

Result: 实验结果表明，PVMark在多种情况下有效工作，能够在不影响水印性能的前提下，为最先进的LLM水印方案提供高效的公开可验证性。

Conclusion: PVMark成功解决了LLM水印检测的信任问题，使检测过程可公开验证而不泄露任何密钥，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

TL;DR: Nexus是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于生成测试预言，通过专门化智能体的协作审议、验证和迭代自优化过程，显著提升了测试预言生成的质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非回归测试中测试预言生成的长期挑战，目标是生成能够准确判断被测函数是否按预期行为的预言。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含四个体现不同测试理念的专门化智能体进行协作审议；生成FUT的候选实现并在安全沙箱中执行验证；对失败的预言启动自动化自优化循环进行调试和修正。

Result: 在七个不同基准测试中，Nexus始终显著优于最先进的基线方法。例如，在LiveCodeBench上将GPT-4.1-Mini的测试级预言准确率从46.30%提升至57.73%；在HumanEval上bug检测率从90.91%提升至95.45%；自动程序修复成功率从35.23%提升至69.32%。

Conclusion: Nexus框架通过多智能体协作和迭代自优化机制，有效解决了测试预言生成的关键挑战，显著提升了测试预言的质量和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Conclusion: SecureReviewer通过专门的数据集、微调策略和评估指标，有效提升了LLM在代码审查中识别和解决安全问题的能力。

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: 当生物体积精度至关重要时，Mask R-CNN是首选；YOLOv11m-seg适合需要速度的大面积部署；U-Net仍是轻量级高灵敏度选项。该框架支持准确、可扩展的果园监测，可通过DEM/DSM集成和现场校准进一步增强操作决策支持。

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

TL;DR: SAMRI是一个专门针对MRI图像的Segment Anything Model改进版本，通过两阶段微调策略显著减少训练时间和参数，在多样化MRI分割任务中达到0.87的平均Dice分数，表现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI分割方法劳动密集，CNN方法泛化能力差，而现有的SAM模型适应MRI时忽视了模态特定的挑战（如对比度变化、强度不均匀性和协议差异）。

Method: 采用两阶段微调策略，仅微调SAM的掩码解码器，在110万标记的MR切片上进行训练和验证，涵盖全身器官和病理。

Result: 相比全模型重新训练，训练时间减少94%，可训练参数减少96%；在多样化MRI分割任务中平均Dice达到0.87，在未见结构特别是小结构和临床重要结构上表现出色。

Conclusion: SAM可以通过简单的微调策略有效适应MRI分割，SAMRI在MRI分割中实现了最先进的准确性，并具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

TL;DR: BRIQA是一个用于儿科脑部MRI图像质量评估的自动化方法，通过梯度重加权和旋转批次处理解决类别不平衡问题，显著提升了多种伪影严重程度的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿科脑部MRI图像质量评估对诊断准确性至关重要，尤其是在低场系统中信噪比较低的情况下。手动评估耗时且主观，需要稳健的自动化解决方案。

Method: BRIQA采用基于梯度的损失重加权来动态调整各类别的贡献，并使用旋转批次方案确保对少数类别的持续曝光。

Result: BRIQA将平均宏F1分数从0.659提升到0.706，在噪声、拉链伪影、定位、对比度、运动和带状伪影等严重程度分类上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 没有单一架构在所有伪影类型上表现最佳，架构多样性很重要。旋转批次配置与交叉熵损失结合能促进平衡学习，提升各项指标性能。

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
artifact severity classification. The code is available at

Abstract: Purpose: Medical foundation models (FMs) offer a path to build
high-performance diagnostic systems. However, their application to prostate
cancer (PCa) detection from micro-ultrasound ({\mu}US) remains untested in
clinical settings. We present ProstNFound+, an adaptation of FMs for PCa
detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:
ProstNFound+ incorporates a medical FM, adapter tuning, and a custom prompt
encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective
evaluation. It aligns closely with clinical scores and produces interpretable
heatmaps consistent with biopsy-confirmed lesions. Conclusion: The results
highlight its potential for clinical deployment, offering a scalable and
interpretable alternative to expert-driven protocols.

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies
with 15 lesion types. This dataset serves two key purposes: (1) enabling robust
training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our
project page https://more-med.github.io/
