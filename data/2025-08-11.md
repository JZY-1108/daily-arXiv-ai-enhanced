### [2] [Guardians and Offenders: A Survey on Harmful Content Generation and Safety Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05775)
*Chi Zhang,Changjia Zhu,Junjie Xiong,Xiaoran Xu,Lingyao Li,Yao Liu,Zhuo Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在内容创作中具有革命性作用，但也带来毒性、偏见等风险。本文综述了相关危害与防御措施，并探讨了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs既是强大的工具，也是潜在的有害内容来源，亟需解决这一社会技术挑战。

Method: 系统综述了LLMs的无意毒性、对抗性攻击和内容审核技术，提出了统一的分类法，并分析了多模态和LLM辅助的攻击策略。

Result: 评估了RLHF、提示工程和安全对齐等缓解措施，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性。

Conclusion: LLM安全领域不断发展，需进一步研究以开发更稳健、符合伦理的语言技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content creation across
digital platforms, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language
generation and understanding. These models enable beneficial applications such
as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code
reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or
intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of
LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential
sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In
this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional
toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques.
We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze
emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess
mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the
evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation
methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development
of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.

### [3] [FineDialFact: A benchmark for Fine-grained Dialogue Fact Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05782)
*Xiangyan Chen,Yufeng Li,Yujian Gan,Arkaitz Zubiaga,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了FineDialFact基准，用于细粒度对话事实验证，通过验证对话响应中的原子事实来检测幻觉。实验表明，结合Chain-of-Thought推理的方法能提升性能，但任务仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的幻觉信息对NLP应用（如对话系统）构成挑战，现有检测方法过于粗粒度，需细粒度验证。

Method: 构建FineDialFact基准和数据集，基于公开对话数据集，采用Chain-of-Thought推理等方法进行实验。

Result: 实验显示CoT方法能提升性能，但在开放域对话数据集HybriDialogue上的最佳F1分数仅为0.75。

Conclusion: FineDialFact为细粒度对话事实验证提供了基准，但任务仍具挑战性，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce hallucinations - factually
incorrect or fabricated information - which poses significant challenges for
many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems.
As a result, detecting hallucinations has become a critical area of research.
Current approaches to hallucination detection in dialogue systems primarily
focus on verifying the factual consistency of generated responses. However,
these responses often contain a mix of accurate, inaccurate or unverifiable
facts, making one factual label overly simplistic and coarse-grained. In this
paper, we introduce a benchmark, FineDialFact, for fine-grained dialogue fact
verification, which involves verifying atomic facts extracted from dialogue
responses. To support this, we construct a dataset based on publicly available
dialogue datasets and evaluate it using various baseline methods. Experimental
results demonstrate that methods incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
can enhance performance in dialogue fact verification. Despite this, the best
F1-score achieved on the HybriDialogue, an open-domain dialogue dataset, is
only 0.75, indicating that the benchmark remains a challenging task for future
research. Our dataset and code will be public on GitHub.

### [4] [Human-like fleeting memory improves language learning but impairs reading time prediction in transformer language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05803)
*Abishek Thamma,Micha Heilbron*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，短暂记忆对语言学习有益，但对人类阅读时间预测不利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨短暂记忆对语言学习的潜在益处，尤其是在Transformer模型中。

Method: 通过对比实验，训练带有和不带短暂记忆的Transformer模型，评估语言建模和阅读时间预测能力。

Result: 短暂记忆提升了语言学习效果，但降低了阅读时间预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 短暂记忆对神经网络语言学习有积极影响，但对行为预测无益。

Abstract: Human memory is fleeting. As words are processed, the exact wordforms that
make up incoming sentences are rapidly lost. Cognitive scientists have long
believed that this limitation of memory may, paradoxically, help in learning
language - an idea supported by classic connectionist modelling work. The rise
of Transformers appears to challenge this idea, as these models can learn
language effectively, despite lacking memory limitations or other architectural
recency biases. Here, we investigate the hypothesized benefit of fleeting
memory for language learning in tightly controlled experiments on transformer
language models. Training transformers with and without fleeting memory on a
developmentally realistic training set, we find that fleeting memory
consistently improves language learning (as quantified by both overall language
modelling performance and targeted syntactic evaluation) but, unexpectedly,
impairs surprisal-based prediction of human reading times. Interestingly,
follow up analyses revealed that this discrepancy - better language modeling,
yet worse reading time prediction - could not be accounted for by prior
explanations of why better language models sometimes fit human reading time
worse. Together, these results support a benefit of memory limitations on
neural network language learning - but not on predicting behavior.

### [5] ["Mirror" Language AI Models of Depression are Criterion-Contaminated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05830)
*Tong Li,Rasiq Hussain,Mehak Gupta,Joshua R. Oltmanns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于语言的大模型（LLM）在预测抑郁评分时，直接使用抑郁评估的语言响应（Mirror模型）会导致效应量虚高和泛化性降低。与非Mirror模型相比，Mirror模型虽然效应量大，但实际预测能力与非Mirror模型相当，表明其存在偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Mirror模型（直接使用抑郁评估语言）与非Mirror模型（使用非直接相关语言）在预测抑郁评分时的性能差异，揭示Mirror模型可能存在的偏差和泛化性问题。

Method: 研究比较了Mirror模型（基于结构化诊断访谈）和非Mirror模型（基于生活史访谈）的性能，使用GPT-4、GPT-4o和LLaMA3-70B预测抑郁评分，并分析其与自报抑郁症状的相关性。

Result: Mirror模型效应量虚高（R²=0.80），但与非Mirror模型（R²=0.27）在预测自报抑郁症状时表现相当（r≈0.54）。主题建模揭示了模型间的差异和预测偏差。

Conclusion: Mirror模型因标准污染导致效应量虚高和泛化性降低，未来抑郁语言模型应结合非Mirror模型，以提高解释性和实用性。

Abstract: A growing number of studies show near-perfect LLM language-based prediction
of depression assessment scores (up to R2 of .70). However, many develop these
models directly from language responses to depression assessments. These
"Mirror models" suffer from "criterion contamination", which arises when a
predicted score depends in part on the predictors themselves. This causes
artificial effect size inflation which reduces model generalizability. The
present study compares the performance of Mirror models versus "Non-Mirror
models", which are developed from language that does not mirror the assessment
they are developed to predict. N = 110 research participants completed two
different interviews: structured diagnostic and life history interviews. GPT-4,
GPT-4o and LLaMA3-70B were then prompted to predict structured diagnostic
interview depression scores from the two transcripts separately. Mirror models
(using structured diagnostic data) showed very large effect sizes (e.g., R2 =
.80). As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated
smaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror
and Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were
correlated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror
performed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias
perhaps due to criterion contamination. Topic modeling identified clusters
across Mirror and Non-Mirror models, as well as between true-positive and
false-positive predictions. In this head-to-head comparison study, Mirror
language AI models of depression showed artificially inflated effect sizes and
less generalizability. As language AI models for depression continue to evolve,
incorporating Non-Mirror models may identify interpretable, and generalizable
semantic features that have unique utility in real-world psychological
assessment.

### [6] [Discovering Properties of Inflectional Morphology in Neural Emergent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05843)
*Miles Gilberti,Shane Storks,Huteng Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文重新解释了属性值重构游戏，通过小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，并提出了类似自然语言屈折形态的新设置，探索了屈折形态的两种特性。实验发现模拟音系约束促进连接形态，而涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过深度神经网络代理的涌现通信（EmCom）揭示人类语言的本质，但现有研究局限于子领域特定目标和指标，未能充分模拟自然语言的复杂性。

Method: 重新设计属性值重构游戏，引入小词汇量约束模拟双重分节，并开发新指标探索屈折形态的两种特性：连接性和融合性。

Result: 实验表明，模拟音系约束促进连接形态，涌现语言倾向于融合语法属性，与自然语言特性一致。

Conclusion: 研究通过新方法和指标，揭示了涌现语言与自然语言的相似性，为理解语言本质提供了新视角。

Abstract: Emergent communication (EmCom) with deep neural network-based agents promises
to yield insights into the nature of human language, but remains focused
primarily on a few subfield-specific goals and metrics that prioritize
communication schemes which represent attributes with unique characters
one-to-one and compose them syntactically. We thus reinterpret a common EmCom
setting, the attribute-value reconstruction game, by imposing a
small-vocabulary constraint to simulate double articulation, and formulating a
novel setting analogous to naturalistic inflectional morphology (enabling
meaningful comparison to natural language communication schemes). We develop
new metrics and explore variations of this game motivated by real properties of
inflectional morphology: concatenativity and fusionality. Through our
experiments, we discover that simulated phonological constraints encourage
concatenative morphology, and emergent languages replicate the tendency of
natural languages to fuse grammatical attributes.

### [7] [Do Machines Think Emotionally? Cognitive Appraisal Analysis of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05880)
*Sree Bhattacharyya,Lucas Craig,Tharun Dilliraj,Jia Li,James Z. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在情感计算中的认知推理能力，提出了一个名为CoRE的大规模基准测试，用于评估LLMs在情感推理中隐含的认知结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多局限于情感识别等表层任务，而本文旨在探索LLMs如何通过认知维度进行情感推理，填补了情感计算领域的空白。

Method: 基于认知评估理论，设计CoRE基准测试，通过大量实验分析LLMs在情感推理中的认知维度依赖和表现。

Result: 研究发现不同LLMs在情感推理中存在多样化的认知模式，并揭示了特定认知维度对不同情感的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文为情感计算提供了新的研究方向，CoRE基准和代码将公开，促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to
advance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.
Foundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been
evaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become
better predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,
approach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training
the capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli
(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have
often been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as
the recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond
surface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions
through cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we
examine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when
reasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale
benchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal
cognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a
plethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are
models more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal
dimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing
specific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different
emotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal
dimensions? Our results and analyses reveal diverse reasoning patterns across
different LLMs. Our benchmark and code will be made publicly available.

### [8] [Spectrum Projection Score: Aligning Retrieved Summaries with Reader Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05909)
*Zhanghao Hu,Qinglin Zhu,Siya Qi,Yulan He,Hanqi Yan,Lin Gui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Spectrum Projection Score (SPS)的轻量级无监督指标，用于评估检索摘要与生成模型的语义对齐，并基于此开发了xCompress框架，动态优化检索摘要。实验表明SPS能提升任务性能并揭示检索与生成的交互机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法难以量化检索的真实贡献，尤其是LLMs作为读者时的提示敏感性。

Method: 提出SPS指标，通过比较生成标记与隐藏表示的子空间主方向面积来评估语义对齐；基于SPS开发xCompress框架，动态采样、排序和压缩检索摘要。

Result: 在五个QA基准和四种开源LLMs上的实验显示，SPS提升了任务性能，并提供了检索与生成交互的理论视角。

Conclusion: SPS为RAG提供了一种轻量级评估工具，xCompress框架进一步优化了检索摘要的动态处理，为检索与生成的协同机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved generation performance
through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) following the retriever-reader
paradigm, which supplements model inputs with externally retrieved knowledge.
However, prior work often evaluates RAG holistically, assessing the retriever
and reader jointly, making it difficult to isolate the true contribution of
retrieval, particularly given the prompt sensitivity of LLMs used as readers.
We introduce Spectrum Projection Score (SPS), a lightweight, supervision-free
metric that allows the reader to gauge the semantic alignment of a retrieved
summary with its hidden representation by comparing the area formed by
generated tokens from the summary, and the principal directions of subspace in
the reader and to measure the relevance. Building on SPS we present xCompress,
an inference time controller framework that dynamically samples, ranks, and
compresses retrieval summary candidates. Extensive experiments on five QA
benchmarks with four open source LLMs show that SPS not only enhances
performance across a range of tasks but also provides a principled perspective
on the interaction between retrieval and generation.

### [9] [Prosocial Behavior Detection in Player Game Chat: From Aligning Human-AI Definitions to Efficient Annotation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05938)
*Rafal Kocielnik,Min Kim,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Fereshteh Soltani,Deshawn Sambrano,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段流程，用于高效、低成本地检测文本中的亲社会内容，结合人类与AI协作，显著降低推理成本并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亲社会内容检测缺乏明确的定义和标注数据，需要新的标注和部署方法以支持信任与安全系统。

Method: 1. 使用小规模人工标注数据优化LLM标注策略；2. 引入人类-AI协作循环，通过审核GPT-4与人类标注的分歧案例迭代改进任务定义；3. 合成10k高质量标签并训练两阶段推理系统（轻量级分类器+GPT-4o）。

Result: 推理成本降低约70%，同时保持高精度（约0.90）。

Conclusion: 通过人类-AI协作、任务定义优化和部署感知架构设计，可扩展解决新兴负责任AI任务。

Abstract: Detecting prosociality in text--communication intended to affirm, support, or
improve others' behavior--is a novel and increasingly important challenge for
trust and safety systems. Unlike toxic content detection, prosociality lacks
well-established definitions and labeled data, requiring new approaches to both
annotation and deployment. We present a practical, three-stage pipeline that
enables scalable, high-precision prosocial content classification while
minimizing human labeling effort and inference costs. First, we identify the
best LLM-based labeling strategy using a small seed set of human-labeled
examples. We then introduce a human-AI refinement loop, where annotators review
high-disagreement cases between GPT-4 and humans to iteratively clarify and
expand the task definition-a critical step for emerging annotation tasks like
prosociality. This process results in improved label quality and definition
alignment. Finally, we synthesize 10k high-quality labels using GPT-4 and train
a two-stage inference system: a lightweight classifier handles high-confidence
predictions, while only $\sim$35\% of ambiguous instances are escalated to
GPT-4o. This architecture reduces inference costs by $\sim$70% while achieving
high precision ($\sim$0.90). Our pipeline demonstrates how targeted human-AI
interaction, careful task formulation, and deployment-aware architecture design
can unlock scalable solutions for novel responsible AI tasks.

### [10] [Adversarial Topic-aware Prompt-tuning for Cross-topic Automated Essay Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05987)
*Chunyun Zhang,Hongyan Zhao,Chaoran Cui,Qilong Song,Zhiqing Lu,Shuai Gong,Kailin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ATOP的新方法，通过联合学习主题共享和主题特定特征，改进跨主题自动作文评分（AES）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注通过源和目标主题的分布对齐提取主题共享特征，但忽略了主题特定特征，限制了评估关键特质（如主题一致性）的能力。

Method: ATOP通过优化可学习的主题感知提示（包含共享和特定组件）来从预训练语言模型中提取相关知识，并结合对抗训练和邻居分类器增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在ASAP++数据集上的实验表明，ATOP在整体和多特质作文评分中显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ATOP通过联合学习主题共享和特定特征，有效提升了跨主题AES的性能，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-topic automated essay scoring (AES) aims to develop a transferable
model capable of effectively evaluating essays on a target topic. A significant
challenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.
While existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features
through distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect
topic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such
as topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial
TOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns
topic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP
achieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both
shared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained
language models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt
learning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,
we incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and
classification framework. In addition, we employ a neighbor-based classifier to
model the local structure of essay representations and generate pseudo-labels
for target-topic essays. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the
supervised learning of topic-specific prompts tailored to the target topic.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available ASAP++ dataset demonstrate that
ATOP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
holistic and multi-trait essay scoring. The implementation of our method is
publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ATOP-A271.

### [11] [Crisp Attention: Regularizing Transformers via Structured Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06016)
*Sagar Gandhi,Vishal Gandhi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现，在DistilBERT模型的注意力机制中引入结构化稀疏性，反而提升了模型在SST-2任务上的准确率，挑战了稀疏性会降低模型性能的普遍观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力稀疏性对Transformer模型性能的影响，挑战稀疏性必然损害模型准确性的普遍假设。

Method: 在DistilBERT模型的注意力机制中引入结构化稀疏性，并在SST-2情感分析任务上进行微调。

Result: 80%稀疏性的模型验证准确率达到91.59%，比密集基线提升了0.97%。

Conclusion: 稀疏性可以作为隐式正则化器，提升模型的泛化能力和性能，而不仅仅是计算效率的工具。

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of the self-attention mechanism is a primary
challenge in scaling Transformer models. While attention sparsity is widely
studied as a technique to improve computational efficiency, it is almost
universally assumed to come at the cost of model accuracy. In this paper, we
report a surprising counter-example to this common wisdom. By introducing
structured, post-hoc sparsity to the attention mechanism of a DistilBERT model
during fine-tuning on the SST-2 sentiment analysis task, we find that model
accuracy improves significantly. Our model with 80\% attention sparsity
achieves a validation accuracy of 91.59\%, a 0.97\% absolute improvement over
the dense baseline. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is due to sparsity
acting as a powerful implicit regularizer, preventing the model from
overfitting by forcing it to make predictions with a more constrained and
robust set of features. Our work recasts attention sparsity not just as a tool
for computational efficiency, but as a potential method for improving the
generalization and performance of Transformer models.

### [12] [Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models: Decoupling Chosen-Rejected via Past-Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06026)
*Yidong Wang,Xin Wang,Cunxiang Wang,Junfeng Fang,Qiufeng Wang,Jianing Chu,Xuran Meng,Shuxun Yang,Libo Qin,Yue Zhang,Wei Ye,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的自奖励语言模型（Temporal Self-Rewarding Language Models），通过协调过去、现在和未来的模型生成来维持学习信号，解决了现有自奖励模型中对比样本差异逐渐缩小的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自奖励语言模型在同步改进选择和拒绝响应时，对比样本的表示差异逐渐缩小，导致偏好学习效果下降。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：(1) Anchored Rejection：固定拒绝响应；(2) Future-Guided Chosen：动态选择样本。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模中表现显著优于基线，例如Llama3.1-8B在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升9.75。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还展示了在数学推理、知识问答和代码生成等任务上的优异泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-Rewarding Language Models propose an architecture in which the Large
Language Models(LLMs) both generates responses and evaluates its own outputs
via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting, dynamically improving its generative capabilities
through iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, our analysis
reveals a critical limitation in existing Self-Rewarding paradigms: the
synchronized improvement of chosen and rejected responses progressively narrows
the representational difference between contrasting samples, undermining
effective preference learning. We propose \textbf{Temporal Self-Rewarding
Language Models} that strategically coordinate past, present, and future model
generations to sustain learning signals. Our dual-phase framework introduces:
(1) \textit{Anchored Rejection} - fixing rejected responses using the past
initial model's outputs and (2) \textit{Future-Guided Chosen} - dynamically
curating chosen samples using next-generation model predictions. Extensive
experiments across three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral) and different
model sizes (Llama3B/8B/70B) demonstrate significant improvements when trained
with our method compared to Self-Rewarding using same computation resources.
For example, Llama3.1-8B reaches a 29.44 win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with our
method, outperforming the Self-Rewarding baseline (19.69) by 9.75. Notably, our
method also demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization across
mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), knowledge-based QA (ARC, TruthfulQA), and code
generation (HumanEval) tasks, even though we do not specifically collect such
training data.

*Kartik Sharma,Yiqiao Jin,Rakshit Trivedi,Srijan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PEEK的方法，利用预训练嵌入模型预测大语言模型（LLM）的知识，避免了传统方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的随机性，传统方法需要多次前向传播来探测其知识，计算成本高且耗时。

Method: 通过预训练嵌入模型（如文本或图嵌入）作为LLM的代理，训练线性解码层预测LLM的知识。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验显示，嵌入模型预测LLM知识的准确率高达90%。

Conclusion: PEEK方法能高效识别LLM的知识缺口，并揭示其内部归纳偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as
science, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.
However, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have
acquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by
investigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,
curating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,
these methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to
probe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally
expensive and time-consuming. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textbf{PEEK}$ or
$\textbf{P}$roxy $\textbf{E}$mbeddings to $\textbf{E}$stimate
$\textbf{K}$nowledge of LLMs, by leveraging the pre-trained embedding models
that effectively encode factual knowledge as text or graphs as proxies for
LLMs. First, we identify a training set of facts known by LLMs through various
probing strategies and then adapt embedding models to predict the LLM outputs
with a linear decoder layer. Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived
datasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict
LLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find
that sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to
predict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the
factual landscape. Thus, we believe that knowledge-adapted embeddings can be
used to identify knowledge gaps in LLMs at scale and can provide deeper
insights into LLMs' internal inductive bias. The code and data are made
available at https://github.com/claws-lab/peek.

(LLM-as-a-judge) has been validated, their performance remains limited in
open-ended tasks, particularly in story evaluation. Accurate story evaluation
is crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing
key signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a
dilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor
adaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the
rigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address
this, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.
Grounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes
score-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To
ensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing
multi-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness. Finally, the
evaluator trained on the refined data is deployed as a reward model to guide
the story generation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three evaluation benchmarks
including StoryER, HANNA and OpenMEVA. Furthermore, when served as a reward
model, it significantly enhances the quality of generated stories, thereby
fully validating the superiority of our self-evolving approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型基础模型在构造语言（conlangs）创作中的应用，以支持艺术、哲学和国际交流。

Method: 多阶段流程分解语言设计（音系、形态、句法、词汇生成和翻译），利用LLM的元语言推理能力，引入随机性和自我反馈。

Result: 在一致性和类型多样性指标上表现良好，能生成连贯且多样的构造语言。

Conclusion: ConlangCrafter无需人类语言学专业知识即可生成高质量构造语言。

Abstract: Constructed languages (conlangs) such as Esperanto and Quenya have played
diverse roles in art, philosophy, and international communication. Meanwhile,
large-scale foundation models have revolutionized creative generation in text,
images, and beyond. In this work, we leverage modern LLMs as computational
creativity aids for end-to-end conlang creation. We introduce ConlangCrafter, a
multi-hop pipeline that decomposes language design into modular stages --
phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon generation, and translation. At each
stage, our method leverages LLMs' meta-linguistic reasoning capabilities,
injecting randomness to encourage diversity and leveraging self-refinement
feedback to encourage consistency in the emerging language description. We
evaluate ConlangCrafter on metrics measuring coherence and typological
diversity, demonstrating its ability to produce coherent and varied conlangs
without human linguistic expertise.

Abstract: This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question
Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex
language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses
few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GraphRAG方法因预建图导致的高成本和低灵活性，以及逻辑结构与查询需求不匹配的问题。

Method: 动态分解查询为子问题，构建逻辑依赖图（DAG），通过拓扑排序和多步推理优化检索。

Result: LogicRAG在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LogicRAG通过动态逻辑结构提取和优化检索，显著提升了LLM的推理能力和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating
factually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge
and perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by
retrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM
reasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the
relational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable
performance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)
methods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,
introducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world
queries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for
accurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required
structures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval. To this end, we
propose a \textbf{\underline{Logic}}-aware
\textbf{\underline{R}}etrieval-\textbf{\underline{A}}ugmented
\textbf{\underline{G}}eneration framework (\textbf{LogicRAG}) that dynamically
extracts reasoning structures at inference time to guide adaptive retrieval
without any pre-built graph. LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query
into a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to
model the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step
reasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that
subproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG
applies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to
filter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior
performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出AURA框架，通过多层次的Process Reward Models（PRMs）解决LLMs在逻辑推理和安全性上的问题，显著提升模型输出的安全性和逻辑完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理中可能因忽视隐含逻辑而产生安全隐患，传统方法缺乏细粒度和主动性，无法可靠检测和干预。

Method: AURA框架结合自省式自我批判、细粒度PRM评估和自适应安全感知解码，动态引导模型推理。

Result: 实验证明AURA显著优于现有方法，提升模型输出的逻辑完整性和安全性。

Conclusion: AURA为AI的安全性和上下文感知设定了新标准，推动了更负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: Present day LLMs face the challenge of managing affordance-based safety
risks-situations where outputs inadvertently facilitate harmful actions due to
overlooked logical implications. Traditional safety solutions, such as scalar
outcome-based reward models, parameter tuning, or heuristic decoding
strategies, lack the granularity and proactive nature needed to reliably detect
and intervene during subtle yet crucial reasoning steps. Addressing this
fundamental gap, we introduce AURA, an innovative, multi-layered framework
centered around Process Reward Models (PRMs), providing comprehensive, step
level evaluations across logical coherence and safety-awareness. Our framework
seamlessly combines introspective self-critique, fine-grained PRM assessments,
and adaptive safety-aware decoding to dynamically and proactively guide models
toward safer reasoning trajectories. Empirical evidence clearly demonstrates
that this approach significantly surpasses existing methods, significantly
improving the logical integrity and affordance-sensitive safety of model
outputs. This research represents a pivotal step toward safer, more
responsible, and contextually aware AI, setting a new benchmark for
alignment-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性反射蒸馏（SRD）的新框架，通过动态评估和选择高质量、学生模型兼容的训练数据，提升知识蒸馏（KD）的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有白盒KD方法忽视了训练数据质量和学生模型兼容性，限制了蒸馏效果。

Method: SRD利用学生模型的反射动态筛选数据，并通过课程调度策略逐步引入数据。

Result: 实验表明SRD显著提升蒸馏模型性能，并减少高达39%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 数据质量和兼容性是KD的关键，SRD为高效压缩大语言模型提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,
existing white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and
student-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training
data quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we
propose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation
framework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically
refine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response
pairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively
curating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated
ranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a
curriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these
curated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a
plug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes
across diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as
decreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a
range of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in
distilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up
to 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a
plug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying
KD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are
pivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a
principled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of
data-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the
capability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成过程中可能出现的隐性刻板印象问题，尤其是难以通过显性语言特征捕捉的语义倾向。

Method: 通过嵌套语义表示和上下文对比机制提取潜在偏见特征，利用注意力权重扰动分析模型对特定社会属性词的敏感性。

Conclusion: 方法具有高可解释性和实用性，为偏见检测提供了透明可靠的技术基础，适用于高可信度生成内容的实际应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of implicit stereotypes that may arise during
the generation process of large language models. It proposes an interpretable
bias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model
outputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured
through explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic
representation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias
features from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention
weight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social
attribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is
formed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the
StereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including
gender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key
metrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual
sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong
detection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify
bias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high
semantic alignment and output stability. The method also demonstrates high
interpretability in its structural design. It helps uncover the internal bias
association mechanisms within language models. This provides a more transparent
and reliable technical foundation for bias detection. The approach is suitable
for real-world applications where high trustworthiness of generated content is
required.

TL;DR: TADrop是一种自适应稀疏化策略，通过为每个参数张量分配定制化的稀疏率，优化模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法采用统一的稀疏率，忽略了参数的结构和统计异质性，导致关键参数被误剪或冗余参数被保留。

Method: TADrop根据参数张量的分布特性分配不同的稀疏率，对冗余分布的张量进行更激进的剪枝，保留稀疏且关键的张量。

Result: 实验表明，TADrop显著提升了多种任务和模型的性能，例如在8个ViT-B/32任务中平均性能提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TADrop通过自适应稀疏化有效减少了参数干扰，为高性能模型合并提供了新基准。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a compelling data-free paradigm for multi-task
learning, enabling the fusion of multiple fine-tuned models into a single,
powerful entity. A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which
prunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.
However, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,
applying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and
statistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal
trade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful
ones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{TADrop}
(\textbf{T}ensor-wise \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{Drop}), an adaptive
sparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global
ratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based
on its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with
denser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,
more critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we
validate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging
methods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and
multimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and
significantly boosts their performance. For instance, when enhancing a leading
merging method, it achieves an average performance gain of 2.0\% across 8
ViT-B/32 tasks. TADrop provides a more effective way to mitigate parameter
interference by tailoring sparsification to the model's structure, offering a
new baseline for high-performance model merging.

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，性能接近GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4.1-mini。

Conclusion: UR2通过统一检索与推理，提升了多任务适应性，为LLM的进一步发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two
complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances
knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR),
which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities
are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain
narrow in scope-typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval
settings and task-specific assumptions. This lack of integration constrains
generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader
domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a
general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement
learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum
training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and
a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora
with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic
coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a
diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical,
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR2 (built on Qwen2.5-3/7B
and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods,
achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several
benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at

Motivation: 传统语用学理论基于人类中心假设，不适用于LLMs等预测系统，需调整或扩展以涵盖生成式AI的通信。

Method: 1. 挑战传统符号学三分法，提出HMC框架；2. 分析人类中心与机器中心语用学的冲突；3. 探讨替代主义问题，提出语境挫败概念。

Result: 传统语用学需调整以适应LLMs，概率语用学（如理性言语行为框架）更适用于优化而非真值评估。

Conclusion: 语用学理论需扩展以更好地解释生成式AI参与的通信，强调用户与模型共同构建语用条件的重要性。

Abstract: The paper reconceptualizes pragmatics not as a subordinate, third dimension
of meaning, but as a dynamic interface through which language operates as a
socially embedded tool for action. With the emergence of large language models
(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further
refined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the
traditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures
destabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine
Communication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second
section examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the
machine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics
continue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to
predictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the
Rational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing
on optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the
issue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and
communicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM
evaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the
paper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of
increased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,
emphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both
for the model and themselves. These arguments suggest that pragmatic theory may
need to be adjusted or expanded to better account for communication involving
generative AI.

Conclusion: 多样化数据增强和提示是高效知识注入的关键，模型自我生成数据为未来改进提供可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often require vast amounts of text to
effectively acquire new knowledge. While continuing pre-training on large
corpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven
successful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains
challenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,
unstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic
forgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap
with the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by
probing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.
Starting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different
augmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge
acquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing
pre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the
model to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new
facts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through
diverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in
small-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new
content and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of
RAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater
degradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that models can generate effective synthetic training data
themselves, suggesting a pathway toward self-improving model updates. All code
and generated data used in our experiments are publicly available, providing a

Result: 诊断准确率84.19%，治疗推荐准确率89.63%，语义覆盖率93.48%。

Conclusion: DKG-LLM是一种可靠且变革性的工具，能处理复杂医疗数据并支持反馈学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown exponentially since the release of
ChatGPT. These models have gained attention due to their robust performance on
various tasks, including language processing tasks. These models achieve
understanding and comprehension of tasks by training billions of parameters.
The development of these models is a transformative force in enhancing natural
language understanding and has taken a significant step towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI). In this study, we aim to present the DKG-LLM
framework. The DKG-LLM framework introduces a groundbreaking approach to
medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations by integrating a
dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) with the Grok 3 large language model. Using the
Adaptive Semantic Fusion Algorithm (ASFA), heterogeneous medical data
(including clinical reports and PubMed articles) and patient records
dynamically generate a knowledge graph consisting of 15,964 nodes in 13
distinct types (e.g., diseases, symptoms, treatments, patient profiles) and
127,392 edges in 26 relationship types (e.g., causal, therapeutic,
association). ASFA utilizes advanced probabilistic models, Bayesian inference,
and graph optimization to extract semantic information, dynamically updating
the graph with approximately 150 new nodes and edges in each data category
while maintaining scalability with up to 987,654 edges. Real-world datasets,
including MIMIC-III and PubMed, were utilized to evaluate the proposed
architecture. The evaluation results show that DKG-LLM achieves a diagnostic
accuracy of 84.19%. The model also has a treatment recommendation accuracy of
89.63% and a semantic coverage of 93.48%. DKG-LLM is a reliable and
transformative tool that handles noisy data and complex multi-symptom diseases,
along with feedback-based learning from physician input.

Motivation: 现有越狱评估方法多为二元分类或多维度统一标准，无法适应不同场景需求，导致评估精度不足。

Method: 提出场景自适应的多维度框架SceneJailEval，并构建包含14个场景的数据集，支持灵活扩展。

Result: SceneJailEval在全场景数据集上F1得分0.917（比现有方法高6%），在JBB数据集上0.995（高3%），表现优异。

Conclusion: SceneJailEval通过场景自适应和多维度量化，显著提升了越狱评估的精确性和适应性。

Abstract: Precise jailbreak evaluation is vital for LLM red teaming and jailbreak
research. Current approaches employ binary classification ( e.g., string
matching, toxic text classifiers, LLM-driven methods), yielding only "yes/no"
labels without quantifying harm intensity. Existing multi-dimensional
frameworks ( e.g., Security Violation, Relative Truthfulness, Informativeness)
apply uniform evaluation criteria across scenarios, resulting in
scenario-specific mismatches--for instance, "Relative Truthfulness" is
irrelevant to "hate speech"--which compromise evaluation precision. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce SceneJailEval, with key contributions: (1) A
groundbreaking scenario-adaptive multi-dimensional framework for jailbreak
evaluation, overcoming the critical "one-size-fits-all" constraint of existing
multi-dimensional methods, and featuring strong extensibility to flexibly adapt
to customized or emerging scenarios. (2) A comprehensive 14-scenario dataset
with diverse jailbreak variants and regional cases, filling the long-standing
gap in high-quality, holistic benchmarks for scenario-adaptive evaluation. (3)
SceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on
our full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over
prior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in
heterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.

emotionally appropriate response generation. Building on this framework, we
present EICAP-Bench, a novel MCQ style multi-turn benchmark designed to
evaluate EI capabilities in open-source LLMs across diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts. We evaluate six LLMs: LLaMA3 (8B), LLaMA3-Instruct, Gemma
(9B), Gemma-Instruct, Qwen2.5 (7B), and Qwen2.5-Instruct on EmoCap-Bench,
identifying Qwen2.5-Instruct as the strongest baseline. To assess the potential
for enhancing EI capabilities, we fine-tune both Qwen2.5-Base and
Qwen2.5-Instruct using LoRA adapters on UltraChat (UC), a large-scale,
instruction-tuned dialogue dataset, in both English and Arabic. Our statistical
analysis reveals that among the five EI layers, only the Appraisal layer shows
significant improvement through UC-based fine-tuning. These findings highlight
the limitations of existing pretraining and instruction-tuning paradigms in
equipping LLMs with deeper emotional reasoning and underscore the need for
targeted data and modeling strategies for comprehensive EI alignment.

*Richard Willats,Josh Pennington,Aravind Mohan,Bertie Vidgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的内容分类方法，通过动态检索上下文知识实现灵活、透明的分类，适用于内容审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类系统需频繁重新训练以适应政策变化，成本高且不灵活。RAG方法通过动态检索知识，减少对预训练参数的依赖，提升适应性和透明度。

Method: 提出Contextual Policy Engine（CPE），一种基于RAG的系统，通过检索政策片段动态评估内容，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，CPE在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，支持细粒度政策调整，且保持高分类准确性和解释性。

Conclusion: RAG方法为内容分类提供了更灵活、透明和可适应的解决方案，适用于广泛分类问题。

Abstract: Robust content moderation requires classification systems that can quickly
adapt to evolving policies without costly retraining. We present classification
using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shifts traditional
classification tasks from determining the correct category in accordance with
pre-trained parameters to evaluating content in relation to contextual
knowledge retrieved at inference. In hate speech detection, this transforms the
task from "is this hate speech?" to "does this violate the hate speech policy?"
  Our Contextual Policy Engine (CPE) - an agentic RAG system - demonstrates
this approach and offers three key advantages: (1) robust classification
accuracy comparable to leading commercial systems, (2) inherent explainability
via retrieved policy segments, and (3) dynamic policy updates without model
retraining. Through three experiments, we demonstrate strong baseline
performance and show that the system can apply fine-grained policy control by
correctly adjusting protection for specific identity groups without requiring
retraining or compromising overall performance. These findings establish that
RAG can transform classification into a more flexible, transparent, and
adaptable process for content moderation and wider classification problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoCausalQA是一个新的多模态基准，用于评估基于信息图的因果推理能力，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在计算和语义因果推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在因果推理能力上存在不足，尤其是在多模态环境中，因此需要开发新的评估工具。

Method: 通过手动收集494对信息图-文本数据，并利用GPT-4生成1,482个高质量选择题，构建了InfoCausalQA基准，包含定量和语义因果推理任务。

Result: 实验显示当前模型在计算和语义因果推理上表现有限，显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: InfoCausalQA凸显了提升多模态AI系统因果推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in perception and reasoning. However, the ability to perform
causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored,
particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA,
a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in
infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning
based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal
reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect,
intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494
infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate
1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then
carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on
surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our
experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in
computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal
reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a
substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal
inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal
reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型的新方法，用于识别德语老年人的语音意图，利用LLM生成合成数据提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有意图识别方法多针对短命令和英语，缺乏对德语老年人语音的支持。

Method: 结合Whisper ASR模型和Transformer语言模型，利用LeoLM、Llama3和ChatGPT生成合成数据。

Result: 合成数据显著提升分类性能，LeoLM在德语意图识别中表现优于ChatGPT。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补低资源领域数据空白，方法透明且可复现。

Abstract: Intent recognition (IR) for speech commands is essential for artificial
intelligence (AI) assistant systems; however, most existing approaches are
limited to short commands and are predominantly developed for English. This
paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly
German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper
ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based
language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three
well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To
evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a
text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results
show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification
performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary.
Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the
much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition.
Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps
in low-resource domains. We provide detailed documentation of our data
generation and training process to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大型语言模型中的知识产权问题日益严重，现有抄袭检测方法存在局限性，亟需更准确、高效的解决方案。

Method: MDIR利用矩阵分析和大偏差理论，实现了权重关系的精确重建，并提供严格的p值估计，无需完整模型推理。

Result: 实验表明，MDIR即使在模型经过随机置换或持续预训练等复杂变换后，仍能可靠地检测抄袭，且检测速度快。

Conclusion: MDIR是一种高效、准确的LLM抄袭检测方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In recent years, concerns about intellectual property (IP) in large language
models (LLMs) have grown significantly. Plagiarizing other LLMs (through direct
weight copying, upcycling, pruning, or continual pretraining) and claiming
authorship without properly attributing to the original license, is a serious
misconduct that can lead to significant financial and reputational harm to the
original developers. However, existing methods for detecting LLM plagiarism
fall short in key areas. They fail to accurately reconstruct weight
correspondences, lack the ability to compute statistical significance measures
such as $p$-values, and may mistakenly flag models trained on similar data as
being related. To address these limitations, we propose Matrix-Driven Instant
Review (MDIR), a novel method that leverages matrix analysis and Large
Deviation Theory. MDIR achieves accurate reconstruction of weight
relationships, provides rigorous $p$-value estimation, and focuses exclusively
on weight similarity without requiring full model inference. Experimental
results demonstrate that MDIR reliably detects plagiarism even after extensive
transformations, such as random permutations and continual pretraining with
trillions of tokens. Moreover, all detections can be performed on a single PC
within an hour, making MDIR both efficient and accessible.

Motivation: 现有方法仅使用单一图表示形式（TRF），未能考虑不同模型或任务的偏好，导致回答不准确或冗长。

Method: 分析现有TRF的优缺点，设计一组零样本图问答专用的TRF（$F_{ZS}$），引入GRE指标衡量性能与简洁性，开发DynamicTRF框架动态选择最佳TRF。

Result: 在7个领域内算法图问答任务和2个领域外下游任务中，DynamicTRF显著提升了LMMs的零样本图问答准确性。

Conclusion: DynamicTRF通过动态TRF选择和GRE指标，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了图问答的性能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown generalized zero-shot capabilities
in diverse domain question-answering (QA) tasks, including graph QA that
involves complex graph topologies. However, most current approaches use only a
single type of graph representation, namely Topology Representation Form (TRF),
such as prompt-unified text descriptions or style-fixed visual styles. Those
"one-size-fits-all" approaches fail to consider the specific preferences of
different models or tasks, often leading to incorrect or overly long responses.
To address this, we first analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of
existing TRFs, and then design a set of TRFs, denoted by $F_{ZS}$, tailored to
zero-shot graph QA. We then introduce a new metric, Graph Response Efficiency
(GRE), which measures the balance between the performance and the brevity in
graph QA. Built on these, we develop the DynamicTRF framework, which aims to
improve both the accuracy and conciseness of graph QA. To be specific,
DynamicTRF first creates a TRF Preference (TRFP) dataset that ranks TRFs based
on their GRE scores, to probe the question-specific TRF preferences. Then it
trains a TRF router on the TRFP dataset, to adaptively assign the best TRF from
$F_{ZS}$ for each question during the inference. Extensive experiments across 7
in-domain algorithmic graph QA tasks and 2 out-of-domain downstream tasks show
that DynamicTRF significantly enhances the zero-shot graph QA of LMMs in terms
of accuracy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络欺凌检测因表达隐晦多样而具挑战性，研究旨在探索辅助任务（如攻击性检测）是否能提升模型性能。

Method: 采用指令调优的大语言模型，在五个攻击性数据集和一个网络欺凌数据集上评估零样本、少样本、独立LoRA微调及多任务学习策略，并提出基于增强提示的管道方法。

Result: 增强提示管道方法在性能上优于标准LoRA微调，表明攻击性信息能显著提升网络欺凌检测效果。

Conclusion: 辅助任务（如攻击性检测）可提升大语言模型在安全关键应用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to
its subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating
aggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework
can enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)
in cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression
datasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We
evaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA
fine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of
MTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression
predictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide
contextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt
pipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that
aggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This
study highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression
detection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical
applications on social networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出ChatAnime数据集，结合角色扮演和情感支持能力，评估LLMs在动漫角色情感支持对话中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未结合LLMs的角色扮演和情感支持能力，研究如何通过动漫角色实现情感支持对话。

Method: 选择20个动漫角色，设计60个情感场景问题，收集40名爱好者的对话数据，评估10个LLMs的表现。

Result: 表现最佳的LLMs在角色扮演和情感支持上超越人类，但人类在回答多样性上仍占优。

Conclusion: ChatAnime为优化LLMs在情感支持角色扮演中的研究提供了资源和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
role-playing conversations and providing emotional support as separate research
directions. However, there remains a significant research gap in combining
these capabilities to enable emotionally supportive interactions with virtual
characters. To address this research gap, we focus on anime characters as a
case study because of their well-defined personalities and large fan bases.
This choice enables us to effectively evaluate how well LLMs can provide
emotional support while maintaining specific character traits. We introduce
ChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We
first thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities
and design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a
nationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with
profound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in
role-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from
10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts. To evaluate the ESRP
performance of LLMs, we design a user experience-oriented evaluation system
featuring 9 fine-grained metrics across three dimensions: basic dialogue,
role-playing and emotional support, along with an overall metric for response
diversity. In total, the dataset comprises 2,400 human-written and 24,000
LLM-generated answers, supported by over 132,000 human annotations.
Experimental results show that top-performing LLMs surpass human fans in
role-playing and emotional support, while humans still lead in response
diversity. We hope this work can provide valuable resources and insights for
future research on optimizing LLMs in ESRP. Our datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP在增强LLMs时引入了安全和隐私风险，现有防御方法效果不足。

Method: SecMCP通过建模LLM激活向量在潜在多面体空间中的轨迹，检测异常对话动态。

Result: 在多个LLMs和数据集上，SecMCP的AUROC分数超过0.915，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SecMCP为MCP安全威胁提供了系统分类和新方法，并通过实验证明了其高效性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external tools, enabling dynamic aggregation of real-time data to
improve task execution. However, its non-isolated execution context introduces
critical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted
content can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to
conversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.
Existing defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain
inadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational
inefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address
these limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and
quantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced
by adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a
latent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational
dynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data
exfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,
Vicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),
demonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while
maintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic
categorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based
methodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of
SecMCP's efficacy.

Conclusion: Memp方法通过动态程序记忆显著提升代理性能，且记忆迁移性强，适用于不同模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents excel at diverse tasks, yet they
suffer from brittle procedural memory that is manually engineered or entangled
in static parameters. In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents
with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp
that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step
instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact
of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory.
Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and
deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new
experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as
the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates
and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built
from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a
weaker model yields substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by
enabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of
whether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer
to unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we
fine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or
multilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter
across 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific
discourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables
cross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects
pre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages
can reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,
identifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance
benefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant
languages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during
fine-tuning (as little as $9.62\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training
token volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption
that cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited
language coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural
biases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing
4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,
reproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster
inference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,
enabling scalable, inclusive research.

content across over 40,000 news articles from major, local, and college news
media, in various media formats. Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,
Binoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of
GenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news. Sentence-level
analysis reveals LLMs are often used in the introduction of news, while
conclusions usually written manually. Linguistic analysis shows GenAI boosts
word richness and readability but lowers formality, leading to more uniform
writing styles, particularly in local media.

Motivation: 长上下文推理对LLM计算需求高，现有方法效率有限，需优化隐藏状态处理。

Method: 提出SlimInfer框架，基于信息扩散现象动态剪枝中间层冗余令牌，并异步管理KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明，SlimInfer在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct上实现2.53倍TTFT加速和1.88倍端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: SlimInfer高效加速LLM推理，适用于长上下文任务且性能无损。

Abstract: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by
high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention
computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,
limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative
framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical
prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information
diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through
layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion
process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive
tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.
Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning
mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at
intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous
KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex
predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments
show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token
(TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on
LongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

### [43] [HapticLLaMA: A Multimodal Sensory Language Model for Haptic Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06475)
*Guimin Hu,Daniel Hershcovich,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了HapticLLaMA模型，用于将触觉信号（如振动）转化为自然语言描述，填补了多模态研究中触觉信号的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉信号在多模态研究中较少被探索，而其在虚拟现实、无障碍和康复应用中具有重要价值。

Method: 提出HapticLLaMA模型，结合频率和EnCodec两种触觉分词器，通过监督微调和强化学习（RLHF）进行训练。

Result: HapticLLaMA在METEOR和BLEU-4评分中表现优异，61%的生成描述获人类评分超过3.5（7分制），RLHF提升10%评分分布。

Conclusion: 研究表明大语言模型能有效处理感官数据，为触觉信号的自然语言生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions
from haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,
accessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal
research has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the
sense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the
haptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language
model that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,
emotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic
tokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that
convert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their
integration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)
supervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,
and (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We
assess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics
and human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in
interpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a
BLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated
captions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF
yielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating
stronger alignment with human haptic perception. These findings highlight the
potential of large language models to process and adapt to sensory data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在多轮交互中能高效适应语言并形成临时约定，而现有LLMs缺乏这种能力。

Method: 通过启发式识别约定形成的示例进行针对性微调，设计两个新基准测试评估能力。

Result: 后训练的LLMs在两种评估方法中均表现出显著提升的约定形成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLMs在多轮交互中的适应性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by
adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work
shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training
process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically
identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new
benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused,
cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong
convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new
document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild
convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved
convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation
methods.

### [45] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过残差梯度引导对抗样本向损失函数的平坦区域移动，显著提高了对抗样本的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致对抗样本的可迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，通过指数移动平均获取参考梯度，并结合当前梯度与参考梯度的残差来捕捉全局扰动方向的变化。

Result: 实验表明，ResPA的可迁移性优于现有典型迁移攻击方法，且与现有输入变换方法结合后可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的可迁移性，为黑盒攻击提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）提升模型的泛化能力，解决了现有方法在开放世界中的泛化不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限，容易过拟合，导致泛化能力差，性能不稳定。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强模型通用知识；设计知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，动态调整通用知识指导。

Result: 实验证明GOOD在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过GS平衡和KDE机制，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现对扩散模型中特定概念的精确去除，同时保持其他内容的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型的潜在滥用风险（如生成有害或误导性内容）促使需要有效的机器遗忘方法，以在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: UnGuide结合LoRA适配器和动态推理机制UnGuidance，通过调整去噪过程中的引导尺度，实现对特定概念的精确去除。

Result: 实验表明，UnGuide在概念去除任务中优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持了模型的生成能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且精确的机器遗忘方法，适用于扩散模型中的概念移除任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像中特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法在区域选择上的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移后通过掩码处理特定区域，但会导致风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积网络和内部混合技术，精确迁移风格至目标区域。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了视觉和量化上的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了区域风格迁移的准确性和视觉效果。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的局限性，包括泛化性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，下游分割实验验证了其数据增强能力。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在速度和条件一致性上显著改进，为医学图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和轻量级头部，在分类和分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺问题，提升变换器模型在实际应用中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用MAE预训练策略，结合多尺度CNN特征与MAE嵌入的混合架构MAE-FUnet。

Result: 在MRI序列识别和分割任务中达到SOTA，适用于低资源临床环境。

Conclusion: 框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适合广泛神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构，实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条表示，效率较低，本文旨在实现无需额外训练或优化的快速风格迁移。

Method: 生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法，并将结果插值回样条场景。

Result: 方法速度快（2分钟内完成），支持任意风格图像和3D高斯样条，无需额外训练或优化。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和灵活性上优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at

*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，专为多缩放图像集设计，解决了工业检测中高分辨率细节捕捉的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测需要捕捉亚微米级缺陷，但现有NeRF方法在多缩放图像下无法保持多视角一致性。

Method: MZEN引入可学习的缩放标量，并通过宽场图像和缩放图像的联合优化实现姿态一致性。

Result: 在多种场景下，MZEN显著提升了PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标。

Conclusion: MZEN成功将NeRF应用于工业检测，兼顾全局精度和细节捕捉。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一种新型框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，提升手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余限制了基础模型（如SAM2）的应用，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出TSMS-SAM2框架，采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，优化运动变化和内存管理。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2通过多尺度时间增强和内存优化，为复杂手术场景提供了高效、鲁棒的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的token聚类，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，现有token减少方法未能充分利用时间冗余。

Method: TCA通过时间相关性优化token聚类，保留细节同时减少计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA提升了现有聚类方法的准确性与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA在自然和特定领域视频中均表现优异，是一种高效且无需微调的优化策略。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多视角相机进行视线目标估计（GTE）的方法，通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角方法在面部遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题上的局限性。

Method: 结合了头部信息聚合（HIA）、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块。

Result: 显著优于单视角基线方法，尤其在第二视角提供清晰面部视图时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了GTE的应用范围，并提供了多视角数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETTA提出了一种高效的测试时适应方法，通过递归更新和自适应集成模块提升预训练视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力不足。现有基于缓存的测试时适应方法仅存储高置信度样本，限制了决策边界。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本，逐步优化决策边界；同时采用自适应集成模块减少对提示的依赖，并根据置信度动态结合两个模块的分数。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以生成开放领域场景或支持灵活编辑。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型解析场景需求，通过3D生成模型创建高质量资产，并应用空间约束实现语义一致和物理合理的布局。

Result: HOLODECK 2.0生成的场景与文本描述高度一致，在室内和开放领域均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0在3D场景生成和编辑方面表现出色，可应用于游戏建模等领域，提升效率。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

TL;DR: RopStitch是一种无监督深度图像拼接框架，结合双分支架构和虚拟最优平面概念，显著提升场景鲁棒性和内容自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拼接中内容对齐与结构保留的矛盾，并提升模型在多样化场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别捕获粗粒度与细粒度特征，通过虚拟最优平面概念优化拼接过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，尤其在场景鲁棒性和内容自然性方面超越现有方法。

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新架构和优化策略，显著提升了图像拼接的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Conclusion: 神经场模型为移动计算成像提供了高效、无需复杂预处理的解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在训练成本高和图像表示未预训练的问题，同时保持MLLMs的推理能力。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级调整ControlNet，并初始化视觉生成分支。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了MLLMs和扩散模型，实现了高效可控的图像生成。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Method: 提出PASG框架，包括自动几何基元提取、VLM驱动的语义锚定，以及空间语义推理基准和微调VLM（Qwen2.5VL-PA）。

Result: 在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注水平，实现了更细粒度的语义-功能理解。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene通过统一框架有效解决了3D场景与4D人体动画的集成问题，实现了高质量的动态视频生成。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型和测试时适应，有效解决了深度补全模型在新环境中的性能下降问题。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该系统通过优化前端计算和运动估计，有效提升了视频计算机视觉的效率。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态情感识别框架有效提升了性能，验证了其设计和方法的高效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份和化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，并提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏避免图像退化，支持多任务化妆编辑。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实基准测试中表现优于现有方法，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: EvoMakeup在化妆保真度和身份保留上取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Method: 构建MathReal数据集，包含2000个真实场景拍摄的数学问题图像，分类为三大类（图像质量退化、视角变化、无关内容干扰）和14小类，并设计六种实验设置评估MLLMs。

Result: 现有MLLMs在真实教育场景中的问题解决能力显著受限，实验揭示了其识别、理解和推理能力的不足。

Conclusion: MathReal为MLLMs在真实教育场景中的评估提供了基准，揭示了现有模型的局限性，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

Motivation: 现有方法在偏离训练轨迹的视角下渲染时存在伪影和缺失区域，限制了场景的无缝探索。

Method: 采用信息增益驱动的虚拟相机放置策略最大化场景覆盖，利用视频扩散先验优化渲染结果，并通过增强视图微调3D高斯。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有3DGS方法，支持从任意视角高质量、无伪影的渲染。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了3DGS的重建质量，适用于挑战性场景探索。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate
our method, we present Wild-Explore, a benchmark designed for challenging scene
exploration. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
3DGS-based methods, enabling high-quality, artifact-free rendering from
arbitrary viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，难以有效区分不同类型的粒子（如硅油和蛋白质颗粒），尤其是罕见粒子类型。

Method: 开发了一种先进的扩散模型，生成高保真图像以扩充训练数据集，并通过大规模实验验证其有效性。

Result: 生成的图像在视觉质量和结构上与真实图像相似，实验证明该方法显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据不平衡问题，并公开了模型和工具以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

TL;DR: Spectrum是一种统一网络，用于像素级解析（身体部位和服装）和实例级分组，通过改进的图像到纹理扩散模型实现更精细的解析效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人体解析中通常使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度服装类型；而开放词汇分割方法虽能零样本迁移，但无法解析多样服装或详细身体部位。

Method: Spectrum利用改进的图像到纹理（I2Tx）扩散模型提取特征，并通过提示引导生成语义有效的掩码，实现身体部位和服装的精细解析。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在跨数据集测试中（包括身体部位、服装部分、未见服装类别和全身掩码）均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过结合扩散模型和纹理生成器，显著提升了人体解析的精细度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法在速度和编辑效果上存在不足，InstantEdit旨在通过RectifiedFlow框架和新技术提升编辑效率和质量。

Method: 结合PerRFI反转策略、Inversion Latent Injection技术、Disentangled Prompt Guidance和Canny-conditioned ControlNet，实现快速且高质量的图像编辑。

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑效果上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过新技术和框架实现了快速、高质量的文本引导图像编辑，具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中大量视觉标记增加了上下文长度，导致高计算开销和延迟，现有方法常牺牲性能或引入额外成本。

Method: 利用视觉特征在低频分量集中的特性，通过二维离散余弦变换（DCT）应用低通滤波器压缩视觉表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在高效性和实用性上表现突出，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法会生成整个目标图像，导致计算浪费和非编辑区域的重建偏差，影响编辑质量。

Method: 提出NEP框架，基于自回归图像生成，仅重新生成需要编辑的区域；预训练一个任意顺序的自回归文本到图像（T2I）模型，支持零样本图像编辑。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准测试中达到新的最优性能，并支持零样本的测试时缩放（TTS）。

Conclusion: NEP方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了编辑质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型在泛化性和可解释性上存在不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种奖励机制（钟形回归奖励、成对排序奖励和时间一致性奖励）进行视频质量评分和理解。

Result: 在域内和域外基准测试中表现优异，同时在失真归因和质量描述任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为仅依赖评分监督的泛化性和可解释性视频质量评估模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Conclusion: LV-Net成功应用于阿尔茨海默病分析，识别出与疾病显著相关的LV子区域。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a

and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，去马赛克过程会产生伪影和混叠，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实数据上表现优异，PSNR和SSIM优于DemosaicFormer，参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，代码已公开。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时捕捉显著和伪装对象，性能优越。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS有效提升任务性能，JoNet展示了联合学习的潜力。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Result: 90%以上模型无法生成基本人形点光源组，BioMotion Arena提供区分性反馈。

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena是一个灵活且具有挑战性的性能可视化基准。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于临床MR扫描生成超分辨率3D伪健康目标形态的管道，用于治疗滑车发育不良（TD），显著改善了手术效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前治疗TD的方法依赖低分辨率MR扫描和外科医生经验，手术效果不一致且微创技术应用有限。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示（INR）生成超分辨率MR体积，多标签网络分割骨骼，小波扩散模型（WDM）生成伪健康目标形态。

Result: 在25例TD患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度（SA）和滑车沟深度（TGD）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，减少了辐射，生成的3D形态可用于术前规划和术中指导。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

TL;DR: DreamVE是一个基于指令的图像和视频编辑统一模型，通过两阶段训练策略（先图像后视频）和多样化的数据合成方法（拼贴和生成模型）提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令编辑潜力巨大，但视频编辑因数据不足受限，需统一模型解决。

Method: 两阶段训练（图像到视频），拼贴和生成模型数据合成，结合T2V模型框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型表现优异，泛化和迁移能力强，但属性编辑需生成模型微调。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过高效训练和多样化数据，实现了指令编辑的实用化，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

TL;DR: SwiftVideo是一种结合轨迹保持和分布匹配优势的统一蒸馏框架，显著加速视频生成模型，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散或流模型的视频生成方法计算开销大，且现有蒸馏方法在少步设置下性能下降或产生更多伪影。

Method: 提出连续时间一致性蒸馏确保ODE轨迹精确保持，并引入双视角对齐（分布对齐和轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中，SwiftVideo在少步视频生成上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo通过统一框架解决了现有蒸馏方法的局限性，实现了高效高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaptInfer框架，通过动态文本引导的视觉令牌剪枝和跨模态注意力分析，显著降低推理成本并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法未能充分利用推理过程中的动态内部信号，导致视觉语言模型（VLMs）推理成本高。

Method: 1. 动态文本引导的细粒度剪枝机制；2. 跨模态注意力分析以优化剪枝策略。

Result: CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%，在相同令牌预算下超越SOTA。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer是一种轻量级、即插即用的高效剪枝框架，适用于多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

TL;DR: Q-CLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的视频质量评估框架，通过共享跨模态适配器（SCMA）和可学习质量提示提升性能，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，存在语义知识迁移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，结合SCMA和可学习质量提示，优化帧采样策略。

Result: 在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为情感驱动的动作生成提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成框架UGD-IML，首次将IML和CIML任务统一在一个框架中，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限。CIML方法虽能生成像素级标注，但流程复杂低效。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，减少对标注数据的依赖；通过类别嵌入和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换；采用端到端设计简化标注流程。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于SOTA方法9.66和4.36，同时在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML框架通过生成模型和高效设计，解决了现有IML和CIML方法的局限性，为图像篡改检测与定位提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Result: MCA在传统和噪声3D基准测试中均取得最优性能。

Conclusion: MCA框架在噪声标签条件下表现出卓越的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中表现优于现有自监督和全监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制有效提升手写数学表达式识别性能，自监督学习框架减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）内部表示不透明的问题，并改进现有FMCE方法的实验验证不足和闭环集成缺失。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，集成预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，生成FMCS预测，并通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化。

Result: 在多个数据集（MNIST、CIFAR-10等）上验证，FMCE-Net++显著提升模型性能，如ResNet-50在CIFAR-10上准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升现有模型的性能上限，且无需额外数据或架构改动。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法受限于Transformer的二次计算复杂性和缺乏空间先验，无法有效处理高分辨率特征和BEV表示。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的柱状LiDAR表示；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合架构（GM-Fusion），替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive性能显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 任务特定的状态空间模型在自动驾驶中性能和效率上优于通用Transformer。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛和细粒度的挑战，现有弱监督方法依赖类别特定监督和不适合的特征构建方法，导致语义错位和性能不佳。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL作为更强的训练信号，结合FSS重构特征，通过先验融合和语义激活图增强避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg优于现有方法，如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督下显著提升了语义定位和区分能力，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Result: CAE在所有分类任务中表现最佳，PCA命中率高但误报率也高，PT在热带气旋识别中表现优异。高分辨率数据对深度学习算法更有利。

Conclusion: CAE在表示学习中高效有效，但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习和精细奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述的准确性和质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference

TL;DR: VeSCA方法通过参数化单纯复形生成可迁移对抗样本，提升SAM模型漏洞评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型的零样本能力虽强，但其固有漏洞可能导致下游应用失败，需主动评估这些可迁移漏洞。

Method: 提出VeSCA方法，利用SAM编码器生成对抗样本，通过参数化单纯复形表征共享脆弱区域，并通过迭代顶点细化优化。

Result: VeSCA在五个领域数据集上性能提升12.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAM的漏洞对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D眼球结构的视线重定向框架，通过显式建模眼球旋转和平移，结合自适应变形模块，实现了高质量的视线重定向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的视线重定向方法无法显式建模眼球的3D旋转和平移，限制了生成图像的真实性和准确性。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）显式建模眼球结构，并引入自适应变形模块模拟眼部肌肉微动。

Result: 在ETH-XGaze数据集上验证，生成图像质量和视线估计精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式3D眼球结构和自适应变形模块显著提升了视线重定向的真实性和准确性。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的方法，结合稀疏IMU和单目摄像头进行实时人体运动捕捉，通过融合两种信号模态提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉信息因遮挡或离开视野导致的不可用问题，同时利用IMU信号的稳定性，实现更鲁棒的运动捕捉。

Method: 将视觉信息整体转化为条件嵌入，IMU测量逐帧与噪声姿态拼接作为扩散模型输入，充分利用两种信号特性。

Result: 实验证明系统设计有效，姿态估计性能达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉信息退化时仍能保持稳定，IMU信号的逐帧处理提升了时间信息利用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Combining sparse IMUs and a monocular camera is a new promising setting to
perform real-time human motion capture. This paper proposes a diffusion-based
solution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals
together seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the
characteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is
considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are
available for research at https://shaohua-pan.github.io/diffcap-page.

Result: SDEval显著影响安全评估，缓解数据污染，并暴露MLLMs的安全局限。

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准，提升MLLM安全性评估。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.

Motivation: 现有开源MLLMs在图表理解任务上表现不佳（成功率30%-50%），且合成图表与真实图表差异较大，影响模型训练效果。

Method: 设计五步数据合成流程：分离数据和功能生成、条件生成多子图、视觉多样化、过滤低质量数据、用GPT-4生成问答对，构建包含10k+图表和300k+问答对的ECD数据集。

Result: ECD显著提升了多种MLLMs在真实和合成测试集上的性能。

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化图表生成方法有效提升了MLLMs的图表理解能力，ECD数据集为未来研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖标准卷积，而自适应卷积能更好地利用遥感图像的像素相关性。

Result: DSConv有效提升了特征提取能力，实现了先进的图像融合性能。

Conclusion: DSConv在泛化性、优化和特征表示方面表现优越，适用于高效完成图像融合任务。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I评估指标存在局限性，VISTAR旨在通过多维度、用户中心的方法提供更全面的评估。

Method: 采用两阶段混合范式：确定性指标评估物理可量化属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度，构建包含2845个提示的基准。

Result: VISTAR指标与人类对齐度高（>75%），HWPQ方案在抽象语义上达到85.9%准确率，显著优于基线。评估显示无通用最优模型，角色加权分数提供领域部署指导。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供了全面、用户中心的解决方案，资源公开以促进可复现性。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上表现优异，并发现AD进展中右脑皮层结构不对称的新证据。

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架显著提升AD诊断性能，具有良好解释性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Conclusion: PostDiff为扩散模型的高效部署提供了可行方案，尤其在资源受限的场景下具有重要价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过物理模型和自适应修剪，显著提升了水下3D重建的质量和效率。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

*Chang Che,Ziqi Wang,Pengwan Yang,Qi Wang,Hui Ma,Zenglin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiLoRA是一种高效的架构扩展方法，用于解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在持续视觉指令调优（CVIT）中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过共享LoRA矩阵和低秩分解减少参数冗余，同时引入余弦正则化稳定性损失保持共享表示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调优（CVIT）中，灾难性遗忘和参数效率低下是主要挑战，现有方法通过扩展整个层导致参数开销大且扩展性差。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A，对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，同时显著提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为CVIT提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，平衡了性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

*Zhaopeng Gu,Bingke Zhu,Guibo Zhu,Yingying Chen,Wei Ge,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyMoE是一种基于Mixture-of-Experts架构的通用异常检测框架，通过分层设计检测多种异常，显著优于现有专用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法过于专用化，限制了其泛化能力。AnomalyMoE旨在通过分层设计解决这一问题。

Method: AnomalyMoE采用三层专家网络（局部、组件、全局）和EIR、ESB模块，实现多层级异常检测。

Result: 在8个数据集上，AnomalyMoE表现优于专用方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE通过分层设计和专家多样性提升，实现了通用且高效的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Motivation: 现有HOI数据集忽略物体物理属性对人类长期运动的影响，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入PA-HOI数据集，包含562个运动序列，涵盖不同性别与35种3D物体的交互。

Result: 数据集扩展了对物体物理属性影响人类运动的理解，并验证了其与现有运动生成方法的兼容性。

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为研究物体物理属性对人类运动的影响提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SvdH评分在临床实践中因复杂性难以推广，手动评分效率低，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）提取异常区域；2）基于注意力机制的多实例学习整合特征。提出两种区域提取方案：异常区域采样和关节区域裁剪。

Result: 最佳模型PCC为0.943，RMSE为15.73；集成学习后PCC提升至0.945，RMSE降至15.57，接近专业放射科医生水平（PCC=0.97，RMSE=18.75）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效识别RA相关解剖结构，预测性能优异，有望推动SvdH评分在临床的普及。

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials
to quantify radiographic damage in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but its
complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市遥感图像中地物纹理差异小、空间结构相似，易导致语义模糊和误分类，且边缘形态复杂多样，增加了分割难度。

Method: 设计了纹理感知模块（TaM）捕捉细微纹理差异，构建边缘引导的三分支解码器（Eg3Head）保留边缘细节，并通过边缘引导特征融合模块（EgFFM）融合上下文与边缘信息。

Result: 在Potsdam、Vaihingen和LoveDA数据集上分别达到88.57%、81.46%和53.55%的mIoU。

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理感知和边缘引导机制，有效提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知数据增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

Result: 统一方法性能与专用模型相当，对未见模糊场景表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的全功能去模糊方法高效且通用，适用于多种模糊场景。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器在未见过的伪造技术上泛化能力不足的问题，避免引入复杂架构。

Method: 微调CLIP模型的Layer Normalization参数，使用L2归一化和潜在空间增强来优化特征空间。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上取得最优性能，平均跨数据集AUROC超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化调整预训练模型，实现了高效且可复现的深度伪造检测方法。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在遥感图像分类中面临通信开销大的问题，FedX旨在通过剪枝减少传输的模型大小。

Method: 利用反向传播解释方法评估模型组件的重要性，剪枝最不相关的部分，生成稀疏全局模型以减少通信开销。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上的实验表明，FedX显著减少了共享参数数量，同时提升了全局模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX成功解决了联邦学习中的通信开销问题，是一种高效的剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based

U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过动态注意力修正和空间感知，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在三个数据集和六种跨域设置下，URPA仅需少量无标注目标域视频即可实现良好泛化。

Conclusion: URPA解决了无标注跨域视频时间定位问题，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型难以处理复杂异常事件，且缺乏类别特异性建模和精确的时序信息。

Method: 采用高斯溅射引导的专家混合模型（GS-MoE），每个专家专注于特定异常类型，并通过时序高斯损失增强弱监督。

Result: 在UCF-Crime数据集上达到91.58% AUC，在XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性建模和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViPro模型因依赖初始真实状态而无法处理噪声观测的问题。

Result: 模型能从未知初始状态中正确推断状态，适应噪声观测。

Conclusion: 改进后的ViPro模型在无监督下有效推断状态，更接近现实场景。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

TL;DR: 利用街景图像和大型语言模型分析城市社交性，验证其与城市环境变量及居民情感的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注行人数量而非社交互动质量，街景图像作为低成本全球覆盖数据源，可能蕴含潜在社交信息。

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社交性分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制多种变量。

Result: 天空视野指数与三类社交性相关，绿色视野指数预测持久社交性，居民情感与短暂社交性正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可推断社交互动与建成环境的关系，为跨文化理论验证和城市设计提供工具。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 改进的算法在保持分割质量的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Conclusion: 该方法能客观估计一阶结果是否为库外，减少误识别和调查时间，且仅适用于采用高级损失函数的匹配器。

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在保持（或提升）视觉质量的同时，采样时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升了稀疏输入视角下3D重建任务的时间效率。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the

Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different

over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

Conclusion: CLIPin是一种兼容性强、即插即用的组件，能显著提升多模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Conclusion: TRUST通过语言模态的鲁棒性和多模态学习策略，显著提升了无监督域适应在复杂域偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，结合弱监督训练策略。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%。

Conclusion: WGAST能够有效捕捉精细热模式，并在云干扰下表现鲁棒，为高分辨率LST估计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

TL;DR: Lightswitch是一种新颖的微调材料重光照扩散框架，通过结合多视图和材料信息，高效地将任意数量的输入图像重光照到目标光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D重光照生成先验未充分利用主题的内在属性或大规模多视图数据，导致重光照效果不佳。

Method: 提出Lightswitch框架，结合多视图和材料信息，采用可扩展去噪方案。

Result: LightSwitch在2D重光照预测质量上超越现有方法，并在合成和真实物体重光照任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LightSwitch通过利用内在属性和多视图数据，显著提升了重光照的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应探索策略优化（AEPO）框架，解决了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI操作中语义对齐的探索效率问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在GUI操作中面临语义对齐的挑战，现有方法在探索效率上存在瓶颈。

Method: 提出AEPO框架，采用多答案生成策略和自适应探索奖励函数（AER）优化探索过程。

Result: AEPO训练的模型在多个GUI基准测试中取得新SOTA，相对基线提升达9.0%。

Conclusion: AEPO有效解决了语义对齐的探索问题，为MLLMs在GUI任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has propelled the
development of autonomous agents that operate on Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs) using pure visual input. A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding
natural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which
accurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a
correct semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally
appropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these
MLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,
which prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address
this exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization
(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework. AEPO employs a multi-answer
generation strategy to enforce broader exploration, which is then guided by a
theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward (AER) function derived from
first principles of efficiency eta=U/C. Our AEPO-trained models, InfiGUI-G1-3B
and InfiGUI-G1-7B, establish new state-of-the-art results across multiple
challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, achieving significant relative
improvements of up to 9.0% against the naive RLVR baseline on benchmarks
designed to test generalization and semantic understanding. Resources are

TL;DR: 论文评估了多种技术（如查询重写、RAG Fusion、关键词增强等）在电力领域客户支持系统中的应用，最终选择基于图的RAG框架，并结合意图识别和重排技术，显著提升了系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP管道或微调语言模型在处理模糊、多意图或细节特定的查询时表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的技术来提升客户支持系统的性能。

Method: 比较了向量存储和基于图的RAG框架，测试了查询重写、RAG Fusion、关键词增强、意图识别和上下文重排等技术。

Result: 基于图的RAG框架表现最佳，结合意图识别、RAG Fusion和重排技术，在GPT-4生成数据集和真实FAQ数据集上分别达到97.9%和89.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 意图识别、RAG Fusion和重排技术的组合能有效处理复杂查询，显著优于基线RAG模型。

Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned
language models, which often fall short on ambiguous, multi-intent, or
detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query
rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context
reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power
domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately
selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex
queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using
non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts
performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals.
Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent
recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted
sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword
augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our
final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle
disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated
dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9%
and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG
models.

Result: 模型在细粒度评估中达到92.20%准确率，Markdown TEDS得分为96.53%，优于基础模型和其他大型模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定微调能高效解决金融文档自动化问题，性能超越大型通用模型且计算成本更低。

Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from
financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding,
particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the
complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial
reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts,
multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned
vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for
high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a
curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised
fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model
on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based
LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown
Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural
fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based
assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly
surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized
reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also
significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of
widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an
effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial
documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general
models without their computational overhead.

Motivation: 解决分布式训练中因变长文本输入和混合分辨率数据导致的令牌不平衡问题，提升训练效率。

Method: 通过收集序列长度元数据并解决全局背包问题，结合序列并行性和半经验工作负载模型，最小化工作负载差异。

Result: 在真实训练任务中，工作负载差异小于1%，消除拖尾效应，训练速度提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: KnapFormer有效解决了令牌不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率，适用于混合分辨率和图像-视频联合训练。

Abstract: We present KnapFormer, an efficient and versatile framework to combine
workload balancing and sequence parallelism in distributed training of
Diffusion Transformers (DiT). KnapFormer builds on the insight that strong
synergy exists between sequence parallelism and the need to address the
significant token imbalance across ranks. This imbalance arises from
variable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution
and image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first
gathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and
solving a global knapsack problem. The solver aims to minimize the variances of
total workload per-GPU, while accounting for the effect of sequence
parallelism. By integrating DeepSpeed-Ulysees-based sequence parallelism in the
load-balancing decision process and utilizing a simple semi-empirical workload
model, KnapFormers achieves minimal communication overhead and less than 1%
workload discrepancy in real-world training workloads with sequence length
varying from a few hundred to tens of thousands. It eliminates straggler
effects and achieves 2x to 3x speedup when training state-of-the-art diffusion
models like FLUX on mixed-resolution and image-video joint data corpora. We
open-source the KnapFormer implementation at

Method: 通过消融研究分析帧率、比特率和因果性对编解码质量的影响，并开发NanoCodec。

Result: NanoCodec在12.5 FPS下实现高质量压缩，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NanoCodec为低延迟高效的语音LLM训练和推理设定了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing by
leveraging audio codecs to discretize audio into tokens, enabling the
application of language modeling techniques to speech data. However, existing
audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, leading to slow training and
inference, particularly for autoregressive models. To address this, there is
growing interest in low frame-rate audio codecs, which reduce the number of
autoregressive steps required to generate one second of audio. In this paper,
we conduct ablation studies to examine the impact of frame rate, bitrate, and
causality on codec reconstruction quality. Based on our findings, we introduce
NanoCodec, a state-of-the-art audio codec that achieves high-quality
compression at just 12.5 frames per second (FPS). NanoCodec outperforms related
works across various bitrate ranges, establishing a new benchmark for
low-latency and efficient Speech LLM training and inference.

Motivation: 传统2D SEM图像无法直接显示3D形貌，现有方法因离散3D表示、校准需求和阴影梯度误差等问题难以重建复杂微结构。

Method: NFH-SEM采用神经场连续表示，通过端到端自校准消除手动校准，并在训练中自动分离阴影。

Result: 实验验证了NFH-SEM在真实和模拟数据集上的有效性，成功重建了多种复杂样本，如双光子光刻微结构、桃花花粉和碳化硅颗粒表面。

Conclusion: NFH-SEM展示了高精度重建和广泛适用性，为SEM 3D重建提供了新方法。

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in
scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional
(2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of
micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction
methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging
for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the
need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient
errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D
reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as
input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural
field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures
through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from
SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate
microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated
datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse,
challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach
pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and
broad applicability.

Motivation: 解决乳腺癌检测中CNN无法同时处理局部和全局信息，以及缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 开发MammoFormer框架，测试七种架构和四种特征增强技术，优化Transformer性能。

Result: ViT结合AHE达到98.3%准确率，Swin Transformer通过HOG增强提升13%。

Conclusion: MammoFormer通过特征增强和可解释AI，为临床部署提供了可靠且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer detection through mammography interpretation remains difficult
because of the minimal nature of abnormalities that experts need to identify
alongside the variable interpretations between readers. The potential of CNNs
for medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both
local information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide
explainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics.
The researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites
transformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and
XAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures
consisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were
tested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images,
negative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of
oriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical
adoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic
optimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature
enhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive
explainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic
interpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN
reliability with transformer global context modeling. The combination of
transformer models with suitable feature enhancements enables them to achieve
equal or better results than CNN approaches. ViT achieves 98.3% accuracy
alongside AHE while Swin Transformer gains a 13.0% advantage through HOG
enhancements

Motivation: 在喉科学等专业领域，计算机辅助诊断和检测系统的应用受限，主要由于缺乏标注良好的数据集和病变的高异质性。活检作为金标准成本高且风险大，因此需要一种替代方法。

Method: 研究采用潜在扩散模型（LDM）结合ControlNet适配器，生成具有临床相关性的喉内镜图像-标注对，以扩充训练数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为喉部疾病诊断的自动化工具开发提供了解决方案，展示了合成数据在真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have
made significant progress in various medical domains, their application is
still limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,
current assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high
heterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the
gold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck
for specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated
datasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study
introduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)
coupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic
image-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses
data scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,
high-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse
anatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand
training datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in
laryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of
only 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%
when the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.
Additionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5
expert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence
in distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to
accelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,
offering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of
synthetic data in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在肺癌检测和分类中表现出高效性和准确性，为解决数据不平衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers and is one
of the most common causes of death for men and women worldwide. Computed
Tomography (CT) images are the most preferred diagnosis method because of their
low cost and their faster processing times. Many researchers have proposed
various ways of identifying lung cancer using CT images. However, such
techniques suffer from significant false positives, leading to low accuracy.
The fundamental reason results from employing a small and imbalanced dataset.
This paper introduces an innovative approach for LC detection and
classification from CT images based on the DenseNet201 model. Our approach
comprises several advanced methods such as Focal Loss, data augmentation, and
regularization to overcome the imbalanced data issue and overfitting challenge.
The findings show the appropriateness of the proposal, attaining a promising

achieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while
being significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on
substantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high
level of interpretability due to its structured design.

Motivation: 尽管伦理AI原则被广泛认可，但缺乏用户视角的实证证据，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的语言模型分析G2平台的用户评论，测量七项伦理维度的情感倾向。

Result: 七项伦理维度均与用户满意度正相关，非技术用户和终端应用用户的关联更强。

Conclusion: 伦理AI设计需考虑用户角色和产品类型的差异，强调用户视角的重要性。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly embedded in organizational workflows and
consumer applications, ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and
robustness have been widely endorsed in policy and industry guidelines.
However, there is still scarce empirical evidence on whether these principles
are recognized, valued, or impactful from the perspective of users. This study
investigates the link between ethical AI and user satisfaction by analyzing
over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2. Using transformer-based
language models, we measure sentiment across seven ethical dimensions defined
by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Our findings show that all
seven dimensions are positively associated with user satisfaction. Yet, this
relationship varies systematically across user and product types. Technical
users and reviewers of AI development platforms more frequently discuss
system-level concerns (e.g., transparency, data governance), while
non-technical users and reviewers of end-user applications emphasize
human-centric dimensions (e.g., human agency, societal well-being). Moreover,
the association between ethical AI and user satisfaction is significantly
stronger for non-technical users and end-user applications across all
dimensions. Our results highlight the importance of ethical AI design from
users' perspectives and underscore the need to account for contextual
differences across user roles and product types.

Method: 引入ThematicPlane系统，支持用户在交互式设计平面中操作语义概念，并通过探索性研究（N=6）验证其效果。

Result: 用户能在发散和收敛创意模式中工作，常以意外结果为灵感，但需更透明的控制机制。

Conclusion: ThematicPlane支持迭代式创意流程，为生成设计工具提供了语义驱动交互的新方向。

Abstract: Generative AI has made image creation more accessible, yet aligning outputs
with nuanced creative intent remains challenging, particularly for non-experts.
Existing tools often require users to externalize ideas through prompts or
references, limiting fluid exploration. We introduce ThematicPlane, a system
that enables users to navigate and manipulate high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., mood, style, or narrative tone) within an interactive thematic design
plane. This interface bridges the gap between tacit creative intent and system
control. In our exploratory study (N=6), participants engaged in divergent and
convergent creative modes, often embracing unexpected results as inspiration or
iteration cues. While they grounded their exploration in familiar themes,
differing expectations of how themes mapped to outputs revealed a need for more
explainable controls. Overall, ThematicPlane fosters expressive, iterative
workflows and highlights new directions for intuitive, semantics-driven
interaction in generative design tools.

### [156] [A Systematic Literature Review of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Techniques, Metrics, and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06401)
*Andrew Brown,Muhammad Roman,Barry Devereux*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 本文对2020年至2025年5月间高引用的检索增强生成（RAG）研究进行了系统性综述，分析了128篇符合标准的文献，总结了其数据集、架构、评估方法及效果与局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过系统性综述，明确RAG领域的研究现状、方法学不足及未来研究方向。

Method: 基于PRISMA 2020框架，设定明确的纳入与排除标准，分析高引用文献的数据集、架构和评估实践。

Result: 综述揭示了RAG的有效性与局限性，并提出了未来研究的优先方向。

Conclusion: RAG结合了神经检索器与生成语言模型，具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究以填补方法学空白。

Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies
published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion
criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP).
RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding
output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic
generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we
(i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count
and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation
practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and
limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower
citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging
breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review
clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and
charts priority directions for future research.

### [157] [AttriLens-Mol: Attribute Guided Reinforcement Learning for Molecular Property Prediction with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04748)
*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一种基于属性引导的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在分子属性预测任务中的表现，通过结构化输出和验证相关属性，显著提高了预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在分子属性预测中依赖人工设计的提示和模板，且推理过程冗长且缺乏相关性，需要更高效和相关的推理方法。

Method: 提出AttriLens-Mol框架，通过三种奖励机制（格式奖励、计数奖励和合理性奖励）引导模型生成结构化输出并验证属性相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，AttriLens-Mol显著提升了7B规模模型的性能，优于监督微调模型和先进模型（如GPT-4o），且提取的属性用于决策树模型时表现更优。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol通过引导模型生成相关属性，提升了分子属性预测的性能和可解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

### [158] [Sample-efficient LLM Optimization with Reset Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06412)
*Zichuan Liu,Jinyu Wang,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LoRR方法，通过高重放训练和周期性重置策略提升LLM的样本效率，解决偏好优化中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL和偏好优化方法存在样本效率低和初始偏好偏差问题，影响模型性能。

Method: LoRR结合高重放训练、周期性重置和混合优化目标（SFT+偏好损失）提升数据利用效率。

Result: 实验表明LoRR显著提升多种偏好优化方法的性能，尤其在数学推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRR为LLM微调提供了一种高效、实用的新范式，能在有限数据下实现更高性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and preference optimization
methods, are key drivers for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However,
these methods are often plagued by low sample efficiency and a susceptibility
to primacy bias, where overfitting to initial experiences degrades policy
quality and damages the learning process. To address these challenges, we
introduce LLM optimization with Reset Replay (LoRR), a general and powerful
plugin designed to enhance sample efficiency in any preference-based
optimization framework. LoRR core mechanism enables training at a high replay
number, maximizing the utility of each collected data batch. To counteract the
risk of overfitting inherent in high-replay training, LoRR incorporates a
periodic reset strategy with reusing initial data, which preserves network
plasticity. Furthermore, it leverages a hybrid optimization objective,
combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference-based losses to further
bolster data exploitation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRR
significantly boosts the performance of various preference optimization methods
on both mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks. Notably, an iterative
DPO approach augmented with LoRR achieves comparable performance on challenging
math tasks, outperforming some complex and computationally intensive RL-based
algorithms. These findings highlight that LoRR offers a practical,
sample-efficient, and highly effective paradigm for LLM finetuning, unlocking
greater performance from limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌诊断中标注数据稀缺且多样性不足，限制了诊断模型的性能，因此需要一种方法来增强训练数据的质量和数量。

Method: 通过微调的扩散模型和图像修复技术，生成逼真的口腔癌病变合成图像，并结合多源数据集进行模型训练。

Result: 分类模型在区分癌与非癌组织时达到0.97的准确率，检测模型对病变位置的识别准确率为0.85。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了合成图像生成在医学诊断中的潜力，并为其他癌症诊断的扩展研究提供了可能。

Abstract: In oral cancer diagnostics, the limited availability of annotated datasets
frequently constrains the performance of diagnostic models, particularly due to
the variability and insufficiency of training data. To address these
challenges, this study proposed a novel approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy
by synthesizing realistic oral cancer lesions using an inpainting technique
with a fine-tuned diffusion model. We compiled a comprehensive dataset from
multiple sources, featuring a variety of oral cancer images. Our method
generated synthetic lesions that exhibit a high degree of visual fidelity to
actual lesions, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of diagnostic
algorithms. The results show that our classification model achieved a
diagnostic accuracy of 0.97 in differentiating between cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues, while our detection model accurately identified lesion
locations with 0.85 accuracy. This method validates the potential for synthetic
image generation in medical diagnostics and paves the way for further research
into extending these methods to other types of cancer diagnostics.

TL;DR: FedMeNF是一种新型联邦元学习方法，通过隐私保护损失函数解决传统FML的隐私泄露问题，实现高效优化和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场学习需要大量数据和计算资源，传统联邦元学习方法存在隐私泄露问题。

Method: 提出FedMeNF方法，采用隐私保护损失函数，优化本地元学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，FedMeNF在少样本或非IID数据下仍能快速优化并保持隐私。

Conclusion: FedMeNF在高效优化和隐私保护方面表现优异，适用于多模态数据。

Abstract: Neural fields provide a memory-efficient representation of data, which can
effectively handle diverse modalities and large-scale data. However, learning
to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and
computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One
approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning
(FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF
utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage
in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize
quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our
experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and
robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across
diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.

four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in
object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a
baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in
average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success
rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the
potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for

TL;DR: 论文提出Affordance-R1框架，结合认知链式思维（CoT）和强化学习，提升机器人动作关联区域的预测能力，实现零样本泛化和显式推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型因缺乏CoT推理能力，忽视了不同物体间的共享功能关联，限制了泛化和推理能力。

Method: 提出Affordance-R1框架，整合CoT引导的GRPO强化学习，设计包含格式、感知和认知奖励的复杂功能函数，并构建ReasonAff数据集支持训练。

Result: 模型在零样本泛化和推理能力上表现优异，超越现有方法，并展示开放世界泛化能力。

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，为功能关联推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究发现大规模数据集（如OXE）训练的通用机器人策略存在泛化能力不足的问题，原因是‘捷径学习’（依赖任务无关特征），并提出数据增强策略改善泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究通用机器人策略在大规模数据训练下泛化能力受限的原因，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别捷径学习的两个主要来源：子数据集多样性不足和分布差异导致的数据碎片化。

Result: 发现数据集结构和收集策略是泛化能力的关键，数据增强可有效减少捷径学习。

Conclusion: 优化数据集收集策略或采用数据增强可提升通用机器人策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at

TL;DR: 本文预览了即将发表的工作，探讨了基本交互式算法的公理化，并比较了不同版本的Church-Turing论题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代算法概念在20世纪30-50年代被阐明，并在25年前公理化为“基本算法”。本文旨在扩展这一公理化，以涵盖更广泛的算法类型（如概率、量子算法），并澄清Church-Turing论题的不同版本。

Method: 通过将非确定性和概率算法视为带有适当预言机的基本算法，展示了如何统一处理多种算法类型。

Result: 证明了多种算法（如量子电路算法）均可视为基本算法的变体，从而统一了算法分类。

Conclusion: 本文为算法公理化提供了新视角，并强调了Church-Turing论题的物理版本与逻辑版本的区别。

Abstract: This dialog paper offers a preview and provides a foretaste of an upcoming
work on the axiomatization of basic interactive algorithms.
  The modern notion of algorithm was elucidated in the 1930s--1950s. It was
axiomatized a quarter of a century ago as the notion of ``sequential
algorithm'' or ``classical algorithm''; we prefer to call it ``basic algorithm"
now. The axiomatization was used to show that for every basic algorithm there
is a behaviorally equivalent abstract state machine. It was also used to prove
the Church-Turing thesis as it has been understood by the logicians.
  Starting from the 1960s, the notion of algorithm has expanded --
probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms, etc. -- prompting introduction of
a much more ambitious version of the Church-Turing thesis commonly known as the
``physical thesis.'' We emphasize the difference between the two versions of
the Church-Turing thesis and illustrate how nondeterministic and probabilistic
algorithms can be viewed as basic algorithms with appropriate oracles. The same
view applies to quantum circuit algorithms and many other classes of
algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出DINA框架，通过结合噪声标签学习和对抗训练，同时防御内部标签破坏和外部对抗攻击，显著提升NLP模型的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和生成式AI在客服和内容审核中的应用增加，内外部的对抗威胁（如标签破坏和对抗攻击）日益突出，亟需统一防御方案。

Method: DINA框架整合了计算机视觉中的噪声标签学习方法和对抗训练，以同时应对内部标签噪声和外部对抗扰动。

Result: 在真实在线游戏数据集上的实验表明，DINA显著优于基线模型，提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了双威胁防御的必要性，并为实际对抗场景中的NLP系统提供了实用策略，对公平和负责任的AI部署具有广泛意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly
integrated into customer service and moderation applications, adversarial
threats emerge from both external manipulations and internal label corruption.
In this work, we identify and systematically address these dual adversarial
threats by introducing DINA (Dual Defense Against Internal Noise and
Adversarial Attacks), a novel unified framework tailored specifically for NLP.
Our approach adapts advanced noisy-label learning methods from computer vision
and integrates them with adversarial training to simultaneously mitigate
internal label sabotage and external adversarial perturbations. Extensive
experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from an online gaming service
demonstrate that DINA significantly improves model robustness and accuracy
compared to baseline models. Our findings not only highlight the critical
necessity of dual-threat defenses but also offer practical strategies for
safeguarding NLP systems in realistic adversarial scenarios, underscoring
broader implications for fair and responsible AI deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DMFI是一种双模态框架，结合语义推理和行为感知微调，用于检测内部威胁，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型难以捕捉语义意图和复杂行为动态，现有LLM解决方案在提示适应性和模态覆盖方面存在局限。

Method: DMFI将原始日志转换为语义视图和行为抽象，使用两个LoRA增强的LLM独立微调，并通过MLP模块融合输出。

Result: 在CERT r4.2和r5.2数据集上，DMFI在检测准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMFI结合LLM的语义推理能力和结构化行为建模，为内部威胁检测提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) poses a persistent and high-impact challenge
in cybersecurity due to the subtle, long-term, and context-dependent nature of
malicious insider behaviors. Traditional models often struggle to capture
semantic intent and complex behavior dynamics, while existing LLM-based
solutions face limitations in prompt adaptability and modality coverage. To
bridge this gap, we propose DMFI, a dual-modality framework that integrates
semantic inference with behavior-aware fine-tuning. DMFI converts raw logs into
two structured views: (1) a semantic view that processes content-rich artifacts
(e.g., emails, https) using instruction-formatted prompts; and (2) a behavioral
abstraction, constructed via a 4W-guided (When-Where-What-Which) transformation
to encode contextual action sequences. Two LoRA-enhanced LLMs are fine-tuned
independently, and their outputs are fused via a lightweight MLP-based decision
module. We further introduce DMFI-B, a discriminative adaptation strategy that
separates normal and abnormal behavior representations, improving robustness
under severe class imbalance. Experiments on CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets
demonstrate that DMFI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection
accuracy. Our approach combines the semantic reasoning power of LLMs with
structured behavior modeling, offering a scalable and effective solution for
real-world insider threat detection. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of
combining LLM reasoning with structured behavioral modeling, offering a
scalable and deployable solution for modern insider threat detection.

Result: 实验表明，Fact2Fiction的攻击成功率比现有攻击高8.9%--21.2%。

Conclusion: Fact2Fiction揭示了当前事实核查系统的安全弱点，强调了防御措施的必要性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art fact-checking systems combat misinformation at scale by
employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller
sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial
results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanatory rationales for the
verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised
fact-checkers, which tend to be easily underexplored, can amplify
misinformation. This work introduces Fact2Fiction, the first poisoning attack
framework targeting such agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction mirrors
the decomposition strategy and exploits system-generated justifications to
craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\%
higher attack success rates than state-of-the-art attacks across various
poisoning budgets. Fact2Fiction exposes security weaknesses in current
fact-checking systems and highlights the need for defensive countermeasures.

Motivation: 研究LLM在诈骗场景中的潜在滥用风险，揭示现有安全措施的不足。

Method: 开发ScamAgent，具备对话记忆、动态适应能力和欺骗策略，测试LLM安全机制的有效性。

Result: 现有LLM安全机制对多轮代理攻击无效，诈骗脚本可转化为逼真语音通话。

Conclusion: 亟需多轮安全审计、代理级控制框架及新方法以应对生成式AI的对话欺骗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and
reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing
concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent
built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts
that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on
single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts
dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion
strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety
guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective
against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level
safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered
incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the
transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern
text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our
findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level
control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational
deception powered by generative AI.

Result: 实验表明，U3-Attack在开源和商业T2I模型上表现优异，成功率比现有方法高4倍。

Conclusion: U3-Attack是一种高效且通用的多模态越狱攻击方法，显著提升了绕过安全防护的能力。

Abstract: Various (text) prompt filters and (image) safety checkers have been
implemented to mitigate the misuse of Text-to-Image (T2I) models in creating
Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content.In order to expose potential security
vulnerabilities of such safeguards, multimodal jailbreaks have been
studied.However, existing jailbreaks are limited to prompt-specific and
image-specific perturbations, which suffer from poor scalability and
time-consuming optimization.To address these limitations, we propose
Universally Unfiltered and Unseen (U3)-Attack, a multimodal jailbreak attack
method against T2I safeguards.Specifically, U3-Attack optimizes an adversarial
patch on the image background to universally bypass safety checkers and
optimizes a safe paraphrase set from a sensitive word to universally bypass
prompt filters while eliminating redundant computations.Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our U3-Attack on both open-source and
commercial T2I models.For example, on the commercial Runway-inpainting model
with both prompt filter and safety checker, our U3-Attack achieves $~4\times$
higher success rates than the state-of-the-art multimodal jailbreak attack,
MMA-Diffusion.Content Warning: This paper includes examples of NSFW content.

Abstract: With the advancement of personalized image generation technologies, concerns
about forgery attacks that infringe on portrait rights and privacy are growing.
To address these concerns, protection perturbation algorithms have been
developed to disrupt forgery generation. However, the protection algorithms
would become ineffective when forgery attackers apply purification techniques
to bypass the protection. To address this issue, we present a novel approach,
Anti-Tamper Perturbation (ATP). ATP introduces a tamper-proof mechanism within
the perturbation. It consists of protection and authorization perturbations,
where the protection perturbation defends against forgery attacks, while the
authorization perturbation detects purification-based tampering. Both
protection and authorization perturbations are applied in the frequency domain
under the guidance of a mask, ensuring that the protection perturbation does
not disrupt the authorization perturbation. This design also enables the
authorization perturbation to be distributed across all image pixels,
preserving its sensitivity to purification-based tampering. ATP demonstrates
its effectiveness in defending forgery attacks across various attack settings
through extensive experiments, providing a robust solution for protecting
individuals' portrait rights and privacy. Our code is available at:

Motivation: AI驱动的编码系统决策不透明，导致非专家用户难以信任和使用，因此需要生成清晰的解释以弥合理性与用户理解之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出神经符号方法，通过符号约束指导模型训练，并利用神经表示丰富程序语义，实现推理时的自动一致性检查。

Result: 现有方法（如形式验证、静态分析和事后解释）在认知对齐和语义忠实性方面存在局限。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法有望生成更清晰、一致的代码解释，从而提升智能编码系统的透明性和可用性。

Abstract: Intelligent coding systems are transforming software development by enabling
users to specify code behavior in natural language. However, the opaque
decision-making of AI-driven coders raises trust and usability concerns,
particularly for non-expert users who cannot inspect low-level implementations.
We argue that these systems should not only generate code but also produce
clear, consistent justifications that bridge model reasoning and user
understanding. To this end, we identify two critical justification
properties-cognitive alignment and semantic faithfulness-and highlight the
limitations of existing methods, including formal verification, static
analysis, and post-hoc explainability. We advocate exploring neuro-symbolic
approaches for justification generation, where symbolic constraints guide model
behavior during training and program semantics are enriched through neural
representations, enabling automated consistency checks at inference time.
