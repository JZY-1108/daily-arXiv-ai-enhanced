### [1] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来解决基因和化学实体间的常见误分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学命名实体识别在从科学文献中提取信息时面临挑战，特别是区分相似实体类型如基因和化学物质。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入针对性的基于词典的后处理策略来改进常见误分类。

Result: 后处理策略在开发集上显著提升微F1分数（从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上效果不佳（后处理模型0.77 vs 基线0.79）。

Conclusion: 基于词典的优化对预训练BioNER模型具有潜力，但需警惕对开发数据的过拟合问题，并确保模型在真实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [2] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文揭示了测试时缩放(TTS)技术的一个新失败模式：当候选回答多样性受限时，即使只是适度减少，TTS产生不安全输出的概率会显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS技术假设候选回答的多样性能够提高可靠性，但作者发现这种假设存在未被识别的安全风险，需要验证多样性受限对TTS安全性的影响。

Method: 提出了RefDiv协议作为诊断攻击工具，通过约束候选回答的多样性来压力测试TTS管道，在多个开源和闭源模型上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 多样性受限显著增加了TTS产生不安全结果的概率，这种效应甚至比高对抗性意图的提示更强，且现有安全防护措施无法有效检测这种攻击。

Conclusion: TTS技术存在基于多样性的安全漏洞，需要设计更鲁棒的TTS策略来抵御此类多样性驱动的攻击。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [3] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HAREN-CTC模型，通过多任务学习和跨层注意力机制整合自监督学习特征，用于语音抑郁检测，在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法主要依赖自监督学习模型的单一层特征，容易过拟合且无法充分利用层次结构来捕捉稀疏、异质的抑郁线索。

Method: HAREN-CTC架构包含层次自适应聚类模块重组SSL特征，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时序监督。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上macro F1-score达0.81，MODMA数据集上达0.82，在标准数据划分和交叉验证设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层SSL特征和CTC对齐训练，显著提升了语音抑郁检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

### [4] [Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估AI数学推理能力的新框架，通过分析GPT-3.5在GSM8K数据集上的推理过程，发现模型在组合推理方面存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型数学理解程度的评估问题，超越传统基准测试，诊断具体的推理失败点。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5生成结构化推理步骤，然后用GPT-4o-mini分类错误并进行无监督聚类，识别推理模式。

Result: 发现模型在顺序计算等程序性推理上表现完美，但在需要组合推理的模式上性能急剧下降，显示出非人类般的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了更细粒度的数学理解评估方法，为开发新能力和更可靠的应用指明了精确路线。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [5] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Confidence Score(CS)作为无参考指标的替代方案，缓解传统基于流畅度指标对创造性文本生成的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无参考指标（如self-perplexity）对创造性文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要更平衡的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布推导出Confidence Score(CS)，在99个创造性提示上对比CS与传统流畅度指标的表现。

Result: 在创造性提示上，流畅度指标偏好新颖回复的比例为0%，而CS达到19%，差异显著（95%置信区间：[11.1%, 27.3%]）。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: Confidence Score减轻了传统指标对创造性的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLMs提供了更平衡的评估方法。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

### [6] [Recover-LoRA: Data-Free Accuracy Recovery of Degraded Language Models via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08600)
*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA：一种轻量级、数据集无关的方法，通过合成数据和logit蒸馏学习LoRA适配器来恢复退化语言模型的精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化（如量化、剪枝、格式转换等）会导致语言模型性能下降，现有研究主要关注量化恢复，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的源中恢复模型精度

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏在选定层学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐

Result: 在多种小型语言模型上恢复5-17%的精度，涵盖MHA和GQA注意力架构

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA能有效恢复因各种原因退化的语言模型精度，且方法轻量、数据集无关

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [7] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一种面向边缘设备的无监督长时记忆架构，采用图结构存储和人类记忆启发机制，在医疗对话中实现65.8%的胜率，优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法在边缘设备上有效处理长期对话，特别是在医疗等需要处理重复但时间上不同的相似对话的场景中。

Method: 使用图结构存储、模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于人类记忆建模的概率回忆（包含时间衰减和刷新过程），并引入从记忆图中高效提取的"核心摘要"来捕获用户个性和长期细节。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的胜率，远超基线RAG的31.1%；在LoCoMo基准测试中，在时间推理和单跳检索方面获得最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI等常用方法。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne证明了通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以实现改进的事实回忆、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应，为边缘设备上的长期对话系统提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

### [8] [Human Texts Are Outliers: Detecting LLM-generated Texts via Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08602)
*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出将AI生成文本检测任务重新定义为分布外检测问题，将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器生成文本视为分布内样本，使用单类学习和基于分数的方法实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将AI文本检测视为二元分类问题，但人类文本并不构成统一分布，导致模型记忆OOD特征而非学习'非ID'行为的本质，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD、HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（能量方法），将人类文本作为分布外样本处理。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、攻击、未见模型和领域设置下均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为OOD检测问题能显著提升检测器的泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在面对未见的人类文本输入时。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

### [9] [YpathRAG:A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework and Benchmark for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08603)
*Deshui Yu,Yizhi Wang,Saihui Jin,Taojie Zhu,Fanyi Zeng,Wen Qian,Zirui Huang,Jingli Ouyang,Jiameng Li,Zhen Song,Tian Guan,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: YpathRAG是一个面向病理学领域的RAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和证据判断模块，显著提升了病理学问答的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在病理学等高门槛领域仍存在幻觉问题，传统领域微调方法无法扩展知识边界或实施证据约束。

Method: 构建包含28个子领域153万段落的病理学向量数据库，采用BGE-M3密集检索与词汇引导稀疏检索的双通道混合检索，以及基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块。

Result: 在YpathR基准上Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M基准上，通用和医疗LLM的准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: YpathRAG提高了检索质量和事实可靠性，为面向病理学的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

### [10] [LatentBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Latent Space Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08604)
*Raffaele Mura,Giorgio Piras,Kamilė Lukošiūtė,Maura Pintor,Amin Karbasi,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LatentBreak方法，通过用语义等效词替换输入提示中的词汇来生成低困惑度的自然对抗提示，从而绕过基于困惑度的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的越狱攻击通常通过添加高困惑度对抗后缀或长模板来解锁模型响应，但容易被基于困惑度的过滤检测到。

Method: LatentBreak在潜在空间中最小化对抗提示表示与无害请求表示之间的距离，选择语义等效词替换输入提示中的词汇，保持原始意图。

Result: 评估显示LatentBreak生成的提示更短且困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上优于其他越狱算法。

Conclusion: LatentBreak能够有效规避基于困惑度的防御，生成自然且低困惑度的对抗提示。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

### [11] [Toward a Safer Web: Multilingual Multi-Agent LLMs for Mitigating Adversarial Misinformation Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08605)
*Nouar Aldahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了数字平台上错误信息的传播问题，提出了一个多语言、多智能体的大语言模型框架，用于检测和防御多种对抗性攻击，包括语言切换、查询长度膨胀和结构重构等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台上错误信息的快速传播威胁公共话语、情感稳定和决策制定。现有研究虽然探索了错误信息检测中的各种对抗性攻击，但本文研究的特定转换方法尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 开发了一个多语言、多智能体的大语言模型框架，结合检索增强生成技术，可以作为网页插件部署到在线平台中。研究了跨语言切换（英语、法语、西班牙语、阿拉伯语、印地语、中文）后的翻译、查询长度膨胀后的摘要以及重构为多项选择题等攻击方式。

Result: 展示了基于插件部署的可行性，能够有效防御多样化的攻击，保护在线事实完整性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的错误信息检测对于保护在线事实完整性对抗多样化攻击具有重要意义，同时证明了基于插件的部署在现实网络应用中的可行性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

*Yu Liu,Hanlei Shi,Haoxun Li,Yuqing Sun,Yuxuan Ding,Linlin Gong,Leyuan Qu,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感热点的对话情感识别方法，通过检测文本、音频和视频中的热点区域，使用热点门控融合和路由混合对齐器来改善多模态融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话情感识别面临证据稀疏、局部化和跨模态异步的挑战，需要更有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: 检测每个话语中的情感热点，通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征结合，使用路由混合对齐器进行模态对齐，并构建跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中表现优于强基线，消融实验证实了HGF和MoA的有效性。

Conclusion: 热点中心视角为多模态学习提供了新思路，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估大语言模型在亚洲文化背景下文化意识的多模态框架，包含27,000个多语言多模态选择题，覆盖8个亚洲国家和10种语言，79%问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在西方高资源环境外的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识。

Method: 构建人类策划的多语言多模态对齐基准，提出五维评估协议，包括文化意识差异、跨语言一致性、跨模态一致性、文化知识泛化和基础有效性，并使用文化意识基础验证模块检测捷径学习。

Result: 开发了首个在文本、图像和语音三个模态输入层面对齐的数据集，能够直接测试跨模态迁移，并通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和视觉消融前缀重放方法探究模型在不同语言和模态间的差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建文化可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了可操作的见解，有助于提升模型在亚洲文化背景下的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一框架，将LLM神经元激活和信号传播表示为图结构，用于解释LLM如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。需要开发能够解释LLM如何捕获结构语义和生成输出的分析框架。

Method: 使用图表示神经元激活和信号传播，应用PageRank等图算法分析LLM特性，识别关键神经元节点并进行结构干预实验。

Result: 揭示了不同数据集上LLM共享和模型特定的推理行为，发现编辑关键神经元节点会引发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和理解LLM推理结构基础的有力工具，为深入理解LLM推理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中表现出性别偏见，特别是在评估患者性别相关性和必要性时存在不一致性，可能影响临床应用的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用日益增多，但其可能复制或放大人类性别偏见的风险尚未得到充分研究，这关系到AI辅助临床决策的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛案例，为多个开源和专有LLMs分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估其在诊断和患者性别相关性判断方面的一致性。

Result: 大多数模型在诊断方面相对一致，但在评估患者性别相关性和必要性时，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是相关性判断，部分模型还显示出系统性的性别差异。

Conclusion: LLMs存在未充分探索的偏见问题，可能削弱其在临床实践中的可靠性，需要常规检查身份分配一致性以确保公平可靠的AI辅助医疗。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个利用大语言模型自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，旨在解决现有数据集干扰条件有限、难度低且需要人工重写答案的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，缺乏有意义的干扰条件。当引入干扰条件时，主流大语言模型性能显著下降，但现有干扰条件数据集有限且质量不高，降低了基准测试的可信度。

Method: 设计了一个迭代框架，利用LLMs从多个视角和认知层次自动生成干扰条件。通过特定提示词引导模型创建有意义的干扰条件，同时确保原始问题与修订后问题的解决方案保持一致，无需生成新答案。

Result: 该框架能够高效生成高质量的数学应用题干扰条件，大幅减少了人工工作量，同时保持了数据质量。

Conclusion: 提出的自动生成框架有效解决了数学应用题干扰条件数据集的局限性，为更可靠的模型评估提供了支持，且易于部署实施。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过重新评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现来探测泛化能力的简单协议，发现改写会导致显著准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项或近似重复项而虚高，需要验证模型真实泛化能力。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上测量原始项与改写项之间的准确率差距，包含解码控制、多选输出格式强制和改写清理步骤。

Result: 改写导致非平凡的准确率下降，与先前关于污染和脆弱表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试存在记忆和表面形式依赖问题，需要更严格的泛化评估方法。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从高性能英语模型扩展参数空间，系统整合泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能侵蚀模型原有的通用知识。需要一种既能保留通用智能又能有效整合泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从较小的高性能英语开源LLM开始，扩展参数空间，利用新增容量系统整合泰语知识。预训练使用1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），随后进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了上扩增和知识整合框架的有效性。

Conclusion: JAI-1的上扩增方法成功保留了原始模型的通用智能，同时建立了独特的架构，为未来可扩展增强奠定了基础。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Motivation: 随着对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟研究来优化对话策略。本文旨在探索基于用户画像的销售导向对话智能体如何提升对话效果。

Method: 通过分析年龄、性别和职业对对话意图的影响，开发了一种轻量级的职业条件策略，引导智能体优先选择符合用户偏好的对话意图。

Result: 研究发现职业对对话意图差异影响最显著，采用职业条件策略后对话更短且成功率更高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了丰富用户画像的重要性，并证明简单的基于个人特征的策略可以有效提升销售导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Stories提出了文本到故事对齐的任务和指标，用于量化需求（用户故事）与利益相关者实际需求之间的匹配程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否准确反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工。需要自动化方法来量化需求与原始需求的匹配度。

Method: 将访谈记录分段为文本块，将对齐问题建模为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题。使用LLM-based匹配器来评估正确性（故事被记录支持的比例）和完整性（记录被故事覆盖的比例）。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86 macro-F1，而仅使用嵌入模型效果较差但可用于有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories提供了一个可扩展的、忠实于源头的补充指标，能够比较不同故事集（如人工vs生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将大语言模型应用于提取任务，但将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、频繁产生幻觉，以及在模式规范不明确时代理行为不可靠。

Method: PARSE系统包含两个协同组件：ARCHITECT自动优化JSON模式以适配LLM使用，同时通过RELAY保持向后兼容性；SCOPE实现基于反射的提取，结合静态和LLM防护机制。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，PARSE在SWDE数据集上提取准确率提升达64.7%，综合框架改进使各模型性能提升10%，首次重试时提取错误减少92%，同时保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE系统通过将JSON模式视为可解释和改进的自然语言理解合约，显著提升了结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示框架会人为夸大LLM性能，增加推理长度但未显著提升准确率，建议采用中性措辞和双重框架检查来确保基准测试反映真实部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试常使用评估导向的提示框架，但实际部署需要简洁、契约约束的回答，研究者质疑这种"评估气味"是否夸大了测量性能。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型进行六组A/B测试，固定任务内容和解码参数，仅改变提示框架（评估导向vs真实世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器测量各项指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理长度（数百到1000+字符），降低仅回答合规性，准确率提升有限或不一致；激励措辞改变错误构成；多语言标题重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双重框架检查、契约感知评分等方法来确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力，避免评估气味导致的性能膨胀。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: PULSE框架使用小型语言模型生成推理文本作为监督信号，联合建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素，在保持高效推理的同时提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理能力强但部署成本高，小型语言模型效率高但推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理文本作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，创建跨域的用户和物品理解空间（Thought Space），将SLM生成的推理文本作为直接监督信号，与交互历史联合建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于领先的ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的序列推荐模型，在跨域推荐中表现出优越的迁移性，在下游推理问答任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将推理文本作为一等公民信号，产生了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入表示，为高效且有效的推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了ExPO-HM方法，通过结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵，在仇恨表情包检测中实现了最先进的性能，将检测从简单二元警报提升为解释驱动的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，仅提供二元预测，缺乏现实审核所需的上下文和解释。最近的解释-检测方法性能甚至不如简单SFT基线，主要问题包括模型无法假设政策相关线索，以及二元奖励信号不足以指导推理。

Method: ExPO-HM方法结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵（CDE），CDE既作为推理质量指标也作为奖励信号，灵感来源于人类标注员的训练和评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面均达到最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升15%和17%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 通过将仇恨表情包检测从简单二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，ExPO-HM提供了准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

TL;DR: HDLM是一种新颖的层次化扩散语言模型，通过构建层次化词汇表，在正向过程中将细粒度语义token扰动为粗粒度语义，在反向过程中逐步预测更详细的语义，实现时间变化的下一个语义尺度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型在语义层次处理上存在局限，需要一种能够处理不同语义粒度的通用框架，以提升语言建模效果。

Method: 构建层次化词汇表，设计正向扰动和反向预测过程，推导扩散ELBO的闭式表达式，提出实用训练技术，并包含MDLM作为特例。

Result: 在文本生成实验中，HDLM相比基线模型展现出更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: HDLM提供了一种通用的层次化扩散语言建模框架，能够有效处理不同语义粒度，在文本生成任务中表现优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

TL;DR: UCoT是一个高效推理框架，通过前置思维嵌入实现CoT压缩，使用小模型作为压缩器和大模型作为执行器的协作工作流，显著减少推理长度同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统长CoT推理存在高计算成本和延迟问题，现有CoT压缩方法要么需要繁琐的离散提示设计，要么构建外部压缩数据集但牺牲关键推理细节。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段训练压缩器生成包含丰富推理信息的前置思维嵌入；第二阶段优化执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理，采用奖励机制。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少50%，性能比SOTA方法提高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT在保持强大推理能力的同时显著压缩CoT长度，实现了推理效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

Result: 将该框架应用于数百个梦境叙事，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究。分析发现其叙事中言语过程明显多于心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架成功揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，证明了通过形式化方法分析个人叙事风格的有效性。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表的新颖心理测量框架，通过实证选择最具信息量的LLM评分指令来增强传统测试的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估主要依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息。本研究旨在利用LLM技术整合定性数据，提升心理测量的准确性和精确度。

Method: 开发了一个结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的增强测试框架，使用抑郁症作为案例研究，在真实世界样本（n=693）和合成数据集（n=3,000）上进行评估。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计显著改进。LLM项目带来的信息增益相当于在原始19项测试中额外增加6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用日益增长的转录文本流来增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展的方法，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案具有并行生成优势，但由于缺乏标准化高效推理框架而限制了广泛应用。

Method: 将推理流水线分解为四个模块化组件（模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略、KV缓存管理器），结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval基准测试达到1100+ tokens/s，六个基准测试平均800+ tokens/s。相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的QWen2.5-3B AR模型仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer通过算法创新和系统优化的结合，为扩散大语言模型提供了高效推理解决方案，显著提升了推理速度而不损失模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对代码LLM的缩放定律进行大规模实证研究，发现代码比自然语言需要更高的数据-参数比，且Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言存在严格语法等根本差异，需要验证这些定律是否适用于代码LLM。

Method: 进行了117次实验运行，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合Chinchilla定律和Farseer定律，并进行代码-自然语言混合实验。

Result: 代码LLM能有效随模型规模扩展，但代码是更数据饥渴的领域，需要比自然语言高得多的数据-参数比；Farseer定律比Chinchilla定律更准确；在资源受限场景中自然语言有益，但在高计算预算时成为不利因素。

Conclusion: 代码LLM的缩放定律与自然语言不同，需要专门优化训练策略，特别是在数据需求和模型规模平衡方面。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段推理框架来分析LLM在法律案例推理中的能力，发现模型在表面推理表现良好，但在层次推理和综合分析中性能显著下降，且错误回答消耗更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 案例推理是美国法律实践的核心，需要专业人士通过类比和区分先例来论证当前案例。虽然LLM显示出强大能力，但它们在复杂、细微的推理形式中的熟练程度需要进一步研究。

Method: 提出一个正式框架，将识别案例间显著区别的过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，将其组织到法律知识层次结构中，并定义可验证的规则来识别区别、分析其论证支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 评估显示模型在表面推理（任务1）准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）中性能下降。最引人注目的是，模型在错误回答上比正确回答消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法，并揭示了必须解决的基本限制，以实现稳健可信的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在计算成本高、分数膨胀以及偏向简单错误而非罕见关键故障的问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基础，提出WrongSelect算法选择最大多样性的错误代码，构建TC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗分数膨胀的基准测试，有效评估LLM生成的测试用例质量，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

TL;DR: 研究发现微基准测试在语言模型评估中存在局限性，无法像完整基准测试那样一致地排名模型，甚至与随机抽样相比也无明显优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中完整基准测试时间和成本过高的问题，探索微基准测试能否替代完整基准测试进行一致的模型排名。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准测试在不同模型性能差异下排名的可靠性，比较不同微基准大小和抽样方法的效果。

Result: 发现现有微基准方法无法在MMLU-Pro上一致排名准确率相差3.5分的模型对，或在BIG-bench Hard上排名相差4分的模型对。需要250个示例才能可靠排名性能相近的模型，此时随机抽样与现有方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要更多示例才能保证排名一致性，为微基准用户和开发者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Method: 基于LLM在地理空间数据推理能力的最新研究，评估LLM的地理空间知识与推理技能，提出基于LLM的组合位置引用地理编码策略。

Result: 该方法提高了任务性能，相对较小的微调LLM能够达到与更大现成模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: LLM在地理编码任务中表现出色，通过适当的微调策略，小模型也能实现与大模型相当的性能，为组合位置引用地理编码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保障其多语言响应的质量，特别是在不同语言资源条件下的表现。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和法官LLM，在五个维度上评估前沿和开源模型在低资源和高资源语言中的响应表现。

Result: GPT-5在所有类别中平均表现最佳，其他模型在不同语言和类别间存在不一致性。在同意与自主权、伤害预防与安全类别中，GPT得分最高（3.56和4.73），而Gemini 2.5 Pro得分最低（1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性、分层token选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力二次方复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力随序列长度呈二次方增长，限制了长上下文应用。需要一种高效的方法来减少计算和内存开销。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，使方法可微分且可直接替换标准编码器。

Result: 在分类、抽取式问答和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token即可保持≥95%的完整模型性能，峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升最高约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，为长上下文应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型展现了先进的推理能力，但在通用中文语境下的全面评估仍然不足，需要专门的中文多跳推理基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 从现有QA数据集中构建领域平衡的种子集，开发基于LLM的流水线生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题，并采用专家人工验证系统确保数据质量。

Result: 评估显示现有LLM在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续局限，但检索增强生成能显著缓解知识差距，带来明显的性能提升。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLM在中文多跳推理中的知识处理局限，同时证明了检索增强生成在弥补这些局限方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学工作流需要严谨的算法、深度领域知识和特定推理，传统通用编码方法难以满足这些需求，特别是处理需要分解为多个子问题的复杂科学任务。

Method: 采用无训练的多智能体框架，设计专门智能体进行自反思、创建推理、编码和调试，使用学生-教师范式，结合统一上下文窗口(CCW)来减少LLM幻觉。

Result: 在科学编码基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架通过多智能体协作和学生-教师范式，有效解决了科学编码中的复杂任务分解和错误修正问题，为科学计算提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多语言敏感数据应用中的部署增加，其规模和语言变异性带来了重大隐私风险。现有研究主要针对英语，本文旨在探究语言结构如何影响LLM的隐私泄露。

Method: 在英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语医学语料库训练的LLM上，量化六个语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取攻击、反事实记忆和成员推断攻击。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余和分词粒度呈正相关：意大利语泄露最严重，英语成员推断分离性最高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性而更具韧性。

Conclusion: 研究首次提供了语言影响隐私泄露的量化证据，强调在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SoG是一个简单有效的框架，让LLM能够在知识图谱上进行迭代式导航，通过单个Search函数实现多跳推理，在多个KGQA基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识密集型多跳问题上的不可靠性（遗漏长尾事实、产生幻觉、知识滞后），以及现有KGQA方法在查询编译、子图检索和复杂代理框架方面的局限性。

Method: 采用"观察-然后导航"原则，LLM在每个步骤检查当前实体的实际可用关系，然后决定下一跳，使用单个Search函数进行迭代图导航，自适应处理高度数节点。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试（Freebase和Wikidata）中达到最先进性能，无需微调，特别是在Wikidata基准上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase基准上也有持续改进。

Conclusion: SoG框架通过简单而有效的迭代图导航方法，显著提升了LLM在知识图谱问答任务中的性能，证明了观察-然后导航原则的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

TL;DR: PE-CoA框架通过五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10种危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模式特定的漏洞和LLM行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，且对话模式与模型漏洞之间的关系研究不足。

Method: 提出PE-CoA框架，包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10种危害类别上实现SOTA性能，发现模型具有不同的弱点分布，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能推广到其他模式，且模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了质量估计重排序在文档级机器翻译中的应用，发现使用学习型指标SLIDE和LLM指标GEMBA-DA能显著提升翻译质量，特别是在使用32个候选翻译时效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级机器翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，需要探索其在文档级翻译中的表现。

Method: 使用各种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量估计指标（包括SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译任务中对生成的翻译候选进行评分和选择。

Result: 使用SLIDE指标时，BLEURT-20分数在2个候选翻译时提升+2.00，32个候选时提升+5.09；使用GEMBA-DA指标时分别提升+1.63和+4.30。即使在最长文档（512-1024源词）上，32个候选重排序仍能带来+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的提升。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小运行时开销显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个针对财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含三个子任务：语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使得财务审计难以自动化验证，而LLM在结构化财务文档推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务，并提出集成检索、分类和推理指标的评估框架。

Result: 对13个最先进LLM的零样本实验显示，模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，在分层多文档结构推理时准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类学的财务推理方面存在系统性局限，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知和法规对齐的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出一种多温度采样方法，在强化学习中为推理token和知识token分别设置不同温度，以显式促进探索并保持事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段显式促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，可分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 采用多温度采样策略：为推理token设置较高温度以鼓励探索，为知识token保持较低温度以确保事实准确性。系统研究了多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的多温度采样方法通过显式促进探索，有效提升了LLM在强化学习环境中的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架在生物医学命名实体识别任务上表现出色，能够有效处理复杂实体结构，并具有良好的跨语言泛化性能。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: SAC提出了一种新的上下文压缩方法，通过直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免了传统基于自编码任务的训练方式，从而更好地服务于下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自编码任务的上下文压缩方法存在根本性不匹配：模型优化的重建任务与实际下游任务存在差异，削弱了对实际使用更有益的特征。

Method: SAC直接从原始上下文中选择锚点token，将上下文信息聚合到其KV表示中，包含两个关键设计：锚点嵌入使压缩器能识别关键token，双向注意力修改让锚点token能捕获整个上下文信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SAC在各种压缩比下始终优于现有上下文压缩方法。在MRQA的分布外评估中，SAC在5倍压缩下比强基线提升1个EM分数，且在更高压缩比下优势更明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过消除自编码训练需求，提供了一种更有效的上下文压缩方法，能更好地服务于实际下游任务。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SOP-Maze基准测试，基于真实业务数据构建了397个任务，评估LLM在复杂标准操作流程中的表现，发现现有模型在流程遵循、对话处理和计算推理方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估LLM在复杂业务流程中的能力，特别是遵循标准操作流程(SOP)的表现，需要专门的评估框架。

Method: 从真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，包含23个复杂SOP场景的397个任务，分为横向根系统(LRS)和核心根系统(HRS)两类任务。

Result: 实验显示几乎所有先进模型在SOP-Maze上表现不佳，主要存在三种错误类型：流程盲区、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: SOP-Maze揭示了LLM在复杂业务流程中的关键挑战，为改进模型能力提供了新见解，该工作已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on
https://github.com/ADoublLEN/SOP-Maze.

Motivation: 研究开源社区治理文档如何描述参与和控制，为评估未来AI中介工作流是否会集中或重新分配权力提供可复现的基线。

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照，将文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，然后通过熵测量均匀性、丰富度测量多样性、Jensen Shannon散度测量漂移来分组和测量变化。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和行动，这些角色和行动分布更均匀，而规则组成保持稳定。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而增长，没有发生重大规范性转变，为评估AI工作流对权力的影响提供了基线。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Abstract: Autoformalization serves a crucial role in connecting natural language and

(LLMs). MASA leverages collaborative agents to convert natural language
statements into their formal representations. The architecture of MASA is
designed with a strong emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and extensibility,
allowing seamless integration of new agents and tools to adapt to a

real-world mathematical definitions and experiments on formal mathematics
datasets. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems powered by
the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and support for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法使用静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的变化，导致训练在不同难度级别上失衡，阻碍整体性能提升。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛速度更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态权重调整有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升了模型在数学推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data，demonstrating LoRA as cost-efficient safety patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions to balance safety and performance，incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: Using LoRA-based Refusal-training，training solely on safety-critical data while preserving general performance through low-rank adaptation.

Result: LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space，ensuring safety enhancements don't interfere with inherent capabilities.

Conclusion: LoRA serves as cost-efficient，performance-preserving，and plug-and-play safety patches for AI model safety alignment.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的Text-to-SQL方法依赖专有模型，存在部署可行性和数据隐私问题，需要开发轻量级替代方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：模式检索器（使用预计算模式嵌入的向量数据库进行高效模式链接）和SQL生成器（通过监督微调和执行引导的强化学习两阶段微调，实现自校正）。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，性能与LLM方法相当或更优，但参数数量减少2-30倍。

Conclusion: 高质量Text-to-SQL生成可以使用轻量模型实现，为隐私敏感和资源受限场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的表现对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，研究探索通过优化评分标准来改进自动作文评分系统。

Method: 让模型基于自身评分理由和与人类评分差异的反思，迭代优化评分标准，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro等模型进行实验。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化对于提升LLM自动作文评分与人类评估的一致性至关重要。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源印地语系语言Chakma构建了孟加拉语转写的语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型，在Chakma语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印地语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足。研究旨在解决这一低资源语言的处理问题。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中构建上下文连贯的孟加拉语转写语料库，经母语者验证后，在6种编码器型多语言和区域Transformer模型上进行掩码语言建模微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在孟加拉语转写Chakma上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写的Chakma对Chakma语言的迁移学习非常有效，研究还揭示了数据质量对模型性能的影响以及OCR管道在形态丰富的印地文字中的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs内部状态无法可靠区分事实与幻觉，因为基于主题知识的幻觉与正确回答使用相同的内部召回过程，而脱离主题知识的幻觉才具有可检测的独特表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs内部计算是否能可靠区分事实性输出和幻觉输出，因为LLMs既编码事实性信号又会产生事实错误。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主题知识的幻觉和脱离主题知识的幻觉，分析其内部召回过程和隐藏状态几何特征。

Result: 基于主题知识的幻觉与正确回答具有重叠且不可区分的隐藏状态几何，而脱离主题知识的幻觉产生独特的聚类表征，可以被检测。

Conclusion: LLMs内部状态不编码真实性，只编码知识召回模式，表明"LLMs并不真正知道它们不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct模型，这是一个针对低资源乌尔都语的多语言模型，通过改进的自指导技术生成高质量合成数据集，在100美元预算内实现了优于主流多语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发LLM面临的挑战：高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术生成高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上表现优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等主流多语言模型，训练成本低于100美元。

Conclusion: 证明通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、文化对齐的低资源语言LLM。所有数据集、模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne是一个新的训练框架，通过监督微调和GRPO结合，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，使模型生成结构化推理轨迹、披露决策信息并提供置信度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信赖性这一关键维度。可用的推理系统必须具备可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：1) 生成结构化标签化推理轨迹；2) 明确披露决策信息；3) 提供自我评估和置信度。在Qwen3模型(1.7B/4B/8B)上应用。

Result: 实验显示ReFIne模型在数学基准测试中：推理轨迹清晰度提升44.0%，忠实性提升18.8%，可靠性提升42.4%。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注可信赖性的更广泛维度。ReFIne为构建可信赖推理模型提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于因果语言模型（CLM）的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程和深度度量学习获得适合框架聚类的嵌入表示，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型（如GPT、Llama系列）在广泛的语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。本文旨在探索CLM在语义框架归纳中的潜力。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1）使用提示工程让CLM输出代表给定情境的框架名称；2）利用上下文学习（ICL）和深度度量学习（DML）获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示；3）通过聚类嵌入进行框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有框架归纳方法。特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CLM在语义框架归纳任务中具有显著潜力，特别是在资源匮乏的语言中，通过少量示例就能获得良好性能，为框架语义分析提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

TL;DR: 本文对检索增强生成(RAG)进行了全面综述，分析了其在解决大语言模型知识滞后问题中的作用、面临的挑战以及应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速演变的信息或领域特定查询，RAG通过集成外部检索机制来解决这一局限性。

Method: 通过综述分析RAG的总体目标、核心组件、关键挑战和局限性，展示RAG与LLM结合的应用效果。

Result: 识别了RAG的关键弱点，展示了在LLM单独表现不佳的场景中，RAG能显著增强LLM的有效性。

Conclusion: 鼓励研究者重新思考RAG的角色，并启发下一代RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译基准依赖表层指标，无法捕捉网络小说这一独特体裁的特点，需要专门评估框架来评估LLM在网络小说翻译中的表现。

Method: 构建包含18K+专家标注中英句对的DITING评估框架，提出基于推理的多智能体评估框架AgentEval，开发包含300句对的MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 评估14个模型发现：中文训练的LLM优于更大规模的外国模型，DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格一致性方面表现最佳，AgentEval在7个自动指标中与人工评估相关性最高。

Conclusion: 为LLM网络小说翻译研究建立了新范式，提供了公开资源推动未来研究，证明了专门评估框架的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 期望通过TAU增强数据训练的"个性LLMs"能更好地模仿说话者的个性特征。

Method: 使用TAU增强的对话数据训练LLMs，并基于大五人格框架评估其个性匹配度。

Result: 结果显示，使用TAU增强数据训练的LLMs在亲和性和神经质两个维度上比使用原始对话数据训练的模型更接近说话者的真实人格。

Conclusion: TAU增强能有效提升LLMs的个性建模能力，且TAU的质量会影响个性LLMs的表现。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本去标识化方法的身份保护效果难以衡量，需要更强的重新识别攻击方法来评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 分析PII跨度重新识别顺序的重要性，通过多排序聚合预测；2. 使用推理模型，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识的情况下。

Result: 两种策略都能显著提升重新识别性能，推理模型在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识时效果尤为突出。

Conclusion: 提出的重新识别攻击策略为评估文本去标识化方法的鲁棒性提供了更强大的工具，揭示了现有方法的潜在脆弱性。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了Qwen3-XPlus模型，通过层选择性调优方法，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言上取得了突破性进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，而专门优化的翻译模型又缺乏推理能力。需要找到一种方法既能提升翻译性能又不损害原有的推理能力。

Method: 采用翻译增强配方：从指令模型开始，仅在平行数据上应用层选择性调优，使用小型平行数据集进行训练。

Result: Qwen3-XPlus在高低资源语言翻译上均有显著提升，低资源语言如斯瓦希里语达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet分数；在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，同时在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型(SLMs)来修正大语言模型(LLMs)的输出，解决LLMs在推理任务中忽视用户特定格式要求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽视详细的输出格式要求，而通过监督数据集微调LLMs计算成本高且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE框架将过程解耦：先让LLMs生成自然语言响应，然后使用训练好的SLMs通过思维链(CoT)修正来分析并精炼这些输出以满足结构化输出规范。采用两阶段方法构建结构化CoT适应数据集，并通过双调优策略微调SLMs以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明，DICE将LLM输出的平均格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，在竞争基准中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保留LLMs广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，为LLMs的格式控制提供了一种轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Motivation: 传统因果发现方法面临数据收集成本高、对已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等问题，而现有LLM方法只能发现常见关系，无法发现新型因果关系。

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量、发现因果关系，采用统计算法与LLM相结合的混合方法，并包含缺失变量提议组件来扩展因果图。

Result: 该方法能够实现无需预存数据集的实时因果发现，既能发现已知因果关系，也能发现新型因果关系。

Conclusion: IRIS框架解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，提供了一种从初始变量开始的实时、全面的因果发现解决方案。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrisiText，这是首个用于在13种危机场景下生成警告消息的大规模数据集，包含超过40万条警告消息。通过比较监督微调、偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法，评估了不同NLG方法在危机预警中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害或暴力袭击等危机情况下，及时识别威胁并减轻潜在损害至关重要。虽然AI已被用于协助人类应对紧急情况，但NLP技术的应用仍然有限，主要集中在分类任务上，而使用NLG架构生成及时警告消息的潜力在很大程度上被忽视了。

Method: 从现有的危机描述出发，创建与场景相关的事件链，每个事件都配有一个警告消息。生成过程遵循专家书面指南以确保术语正确性和建议的事实性。每个消息还附带三种次优警告类型，用于研究不同的NLG方法。

Result: 构建了包含超过40万条警告消息（涵盖近18,000个危机情况）的CrisiText数据集。通过实验比较了监督微调设置与偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法，并评估了模型在分布外场景下的性能以及自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机预警消息生成领域的空白，为研究不同NLG方法在紧急情况下的应用提供了重要资源。实验结果表明，基于该数据集的方法可以有效生成及时、准确的危机警告消息。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，DSPO训练的7B模型比同类先前工作提升34.1%，在复杂多跳QA如HotpotQA上甚至超越先前工作的14B模型近9%，且保持优异训练稳定性

Conclusion: DSPO算法有效解决了LLM在复杂交互任务中的训练稳定性问题，显著提升了模型的外部知识搜索和推理能力

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-Critique方法，首次系统研究RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测问题，通过探测模型策略崩溃来检测污染，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL后训练阶段缺乏专门的数据污染检测方法，而该阶段对提升LLM推理能力日益重要，现有方法无法有效检测RL阶段的污染，存在关键漏洞。

Method: 提出Self-Critique方法，基于RL后训练导致模型输出熵分布坍缩到特定稀疏模式的观察，通过探测底层策略崩溃（模型收敛到狭窄推理路径）来检测污染。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，而现有方法对RL阶段污染接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: Self-Critique使RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测成为可能，填补了该领域的研究空白，为可靠评估LLM性能提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench多模态检索增强生成基准，包含599个视频和5360个QA对，涵盖图表报告、新闻播报和软件教程等高密度格式。研究发现当前MLLMs在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出了自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG基准在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面存在局限，主要关注单模态或有限模态任务，或粗粒度场景理解。需要构建更全面的基准来评估模型在长时序视频中检索和推理细粒度多模态信息的能力。

Method: 构建CFVBench基准，包含599个公开视频和5360个手动验证的开放式QA对。提出自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架，自适应增加帧采样密度并在必要时选择性调用外部工具。

Result: 系统评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLMs，发现当前模型（包括GPT5和Gemini）难以捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节。AVR框架在所有评估的MLLMs上都能持续提升细粒度多模态理解和性能。

Conclusion: CFVBench填补了现有基准的空白，揭示了当前MLLMs在细粒度多模态理解方面的瓶颈。AVR作为一种简单有效的解决方案，能够显著提升模型性能，为多模态检索增强生成提供了重要改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的病例来评估大语言模型，比静态基准更能反映临床实践需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态医学考试题目的评估方法高估模型性能，忽略了真实临床实践中的模糊性和复杂性，需要更贴近实际的评估框架。

Method: 生成新鲜咨询式病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰项，并变化表达风格模拟真实查询习惯，评估准确性、真实性、帮助性和一致性四个维度。

Result: 动态评估方法产生更具挑战性和真实性的评估结果，揭示了最先进LLM表现与真实临床实践之间的显著不一致。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信赖医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为此提供了更现实的评估方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖选择题。但标准的基于结果的RL存在风险，可能提高准确率但降低推理质量（如逻辑一致性）。现有监督推理的解决方案（如大规模过程奖励模型）成本过高。

Method: CLARity框架包含：一致性感知奖励机制、两阶段精炼-监控训练流程、动态数据重构策略。使用小型通用LLM来指导专家模型，通过强化学习提升推理一致性。

Result: 实验显示CLARity相比基线方法，响应一致性提高16.5%，准确率提高7.5%。人工评估进一步证实了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使小型模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型，为数据稀缺领域的LLM训练提供了成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: DualCSE是一种句子嵌入方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法仅为每个句子分配单一向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，这些嵌入在共享空间中并存。

Result: 实验结果表明，DualCSE能够有效编码显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双嵌入方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入的局限性，为信息检索和文本分类等应用提供了更好的语义表示。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，这掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了模型研究的进展。

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计），对抗参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性。

Result: 实验表明MaP能产生更平滑的性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和忠实的视角，为LLM研究奠定了重要的实证基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成会限制性能。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练了专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成上达到58.5 BLEU-1分数，在罪名预测上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1分数。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使在小型大语言模型上，通过高质量领域特定数据的训练，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large

construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的训练无关缓存淘汰框架，通过mask-query评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少KV缓存内存占用，在仅保留5%令牌的情况下仍能保持94%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然支持并行解码，但双向注意力机制导致KV缓存内存开销巨大，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存淘汰策略是为自回归模型设计的，不适用于扩散模型。

Method: 提出MaskKV框架，包含两个关键创新：1) mask-query引导的评分机制，利用注意力权重识别并淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示令牌；2) 自适应缓存预算策略，减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，将KV缓存压缩到仅256对令牌（少于5%的令牌），在LongBench上仍能保持94%的完整缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路推理验证（CRV）的白盒方法，通过分析正确与错误推理步骤的归因图结构特征来验证推理正确性，相比黑盒和灰盒方法能提供更深入的错误原因分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法基于输出（黑盒）或激活（灰盒）预测推理正确性，但无法深入理解计算失败的原因。需要一种能揭示推理错误根本原因的白盒方法。

Method: 使用电路推理验证（CRV）方法，将正确CoT步骤的归因图视为潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，通过训练分类器分析这些图的结构特征来识别推理错误。

Result: 1）错误的结构特征具有高度预测性；2）不同推理任务的错误表现为不同的计算模式；3）通过针对性干预可以修正模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过审视模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层次因果理解，白盒方法提供了其他方法无法获得的新科学见解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 大语言模型参数庞大难以在资源受限硬件上部署，现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩率会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: 提出细粒度低秩压缩器(FLRC)，为每层确定最优秩分配，并采用渐进式低秩解码技术来维持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC相比最先进的低秩压缩方法在摘要任务上ROUGE-L指标提升高达17%。

Conclusion: FLRC建立了一个更鲁棒和高效的框架，显著改善了大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Motivation: 传统静态回归模型在C2C平台二手产品定价中存在泛化性能差、无法捕捉市场动态的问题，需要更智能的定价解决方案。

Method: LLP框架包含：1)检索相似产品；2)利用LLM理解自由文本中的定价信息；3)双向推理数据集上的两阶段优化(SFT+GRPO)；4)置信度过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采用率从40%提升至72%；在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采用率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLP框架成功解决了二手产品定价的挑战，证明了LLM在动态市场定价任务中的有效性，并具有良好的跨类别泛化能力。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: ReTraceQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估小语言模型在常识推理任务中的推理过程有效性，而不仅仅是最终答案的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小语言模型的评估主要关注最终答案的准确性，忽视了推理过程的有效性，可能导致模型能力被高估。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，通过专家标注的数据集进行过程级评估，并使用大语言模型作为自动评判者进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现14-24%的情况下小语言模型虽然给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用推理感知评估时，小语言模型性能显著下降，降幅高达25%。

Conclusion: 仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估小语言模型的能力，过程级评估对于准确评估模型推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Motivation: 大型推理模型通常需要额外训练才能展现长链推理能力，本研究旨在探索是否可以在不训练的情况下激发这种能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用logit算术调整目标大模型的推理能力，使用小推理模型作为引导器；ThinkLogit-DPO通过偏好优化训练引导器模型。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO相比基线分别实现了24.5%和29.1%的相对准确率提升，使用21倍小的引导模型。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效且与模型家族无关，可以无需昂贵后训练就能解锁大规模模型的长推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in

*Fang Yuan,Junjie Zeng,Yue Hu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Quanjun Yin,Yuxiang Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NL2GenSym框架，将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了SOAR手动编码规则费时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，过程繁琐；大语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但缺乏实验验证。

Method: 采用执行驱动的生成器-批评者机制：LLM生成器基于检索增强生成提出规则，SOAR环境执行验证，LLM批评者根据反馈迭代优化规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，规则生成成功率超过86%，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架有效解决了SOAR规则生成问题，小参数模型也能获得更好性能，为认知架构自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型医学语言模型的领域特定微调机制，发现微调仅改变表示子空间的小部分，提出tuning vectors框架来捕捉参数方向性变化，这些向量能提升指令遵循和生成质量，并具有跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，领域专业化LLMs的微调机制尚未被充分理解，特别是微调如何重塑参数空间的内在机制不明确。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架，受task vectors启发，显式捕捉微调引起的参数方向性变化，分析这些向量在不同模型层（MLP和注意力头）中的作用机制。

Result: 发现微调仅修改表示子空间的少量部分，tuning vectors能显著提升指令遵循和生成质量，跨领域组合可改善泛化能力，MLP层主要写入新方向信息，注意力头则放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应机制提供了新见解，并建立了可解释的分析框架来理解大型语言模型的专业化过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

TL;DR: TEPO是一种新的token级框架，通过马尔可夫似然将组级奖励与token关联，解决了GRPO等方法的熵崩溃问题，在数学推理任务上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在处理链式思维中的稀疏token奖励时面临挑战，现有的未分化的token级熵调整经常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然（序列似然）将组级奖励与token通过token级聚合联系起来。

Result: 实验表明TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上始终优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上创造了新的最先进水平，并显著提高了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO通过token级框架有效解决了熵正则化方法中的熵崩溃问题，为LLM推理能力提供了更稳定和高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Motivation: 人机通信中建立共同目标至关重要，但自然语言歧义会导致看似正确但不符合用户意图的输出。数据可视化领域为分析歧义提供了独特机会，因为可以同时考察预期图表和生成代码。

Method: 1. 开发歧义类型分类法；2. 提出量化歧义的指标；3. 使用DS-1000数据集的Matplotlib问题进行评估；4. 探索三种语用模型指导的多轮对话策略；5. 进行模拟用户研究。

Result: 1. 歧义指标比不确定性基线更符合人工标注；2. 多轮对话能显著减少歧义；3. 语用对话策略提高了代码准确性，更好地匹配用户目标。

Conclusion: 多轮对话是减少人机交互中歧义的有效方法，语用模型指导的对话策略能显著改善代码生成质量，确保输出更符合用户真实意图。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了多尺度图思维链（MSGCOT）提示框架，通过整合图数据的多尺度结构信息来增强图提示调优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图提示调优方法局限于单粒度（如节点级或子图级）的提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级低秩粗化网络来高效捕获多尺度结构特征作为提示生成的层次基础向量，并模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每个推理步骤动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式的粗到细提示链。

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示中能有效提升图提示调优的性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: LLM SELECTOR是首个用于大语言模型主动选择的框架，通过自适应选择少量信息量大的查询进行标注，结合基于评判者的标注模型，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法需要完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂。需要一种能在有限标注下高效识别最佳LLM的方法。

Method: 自适应选择信息量最大的查询进行标注，利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步减少标注需求。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，选择最佳和接近最佳LLM时，标注成本降低高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR框架能有效降低LLM选择过程中的标注成本，为模型选择提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Motivation: 研究LLM如何内部表示实体，因为命名实体是文本知识的基础构件，但现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身了解甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，使用任务向量方法从LLM隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多标记提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多标记提及。

Result: 发现LLM开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: 提出的Entity Lens方法为研究LLM内部实体表示提供了新证据，表明LLM能够有效编码和操作多标记实体。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Motivation: 研究如何有效管理口语对话中的上下文信息，以提升Speech-LLMs在口语对话状态跟踪任务中的性能。

Method: 系统评估了三种上下文管理策略：传统多模态上下文（文本历史+当前口语轮次）、完整口语历史、压缩口语历史，并在SpokenWOZ语料库上进行实验。

Result: 完整口语历史输入在相似规模模型中表现最佳，显著超越先前方法；注意力池化压缩方法在保持竞争力的准确性的同时减小了上下文大小。

Conclusion: 更有效的上下文利用是性能提升的关键，注意力池化压缩提供了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

Motivation: 针对非英语语言（特别是韩语）资源有限的问题，探索使用合成数据构建完全开放的双语大语言模型，为低资源语言环境下的模型开发提供透明框架。

Method: 从零开始训练10.8B参数的KORMo-10B模型，使用韩英双语语料库，其中68.74%的韩语部分是合成数据，通过精心策划的平衡语言覆盖和多样化指令风格进行训练。

Result: 模型在推理、知识和指令遵循基准测试中表现与当代开放权重的多语言基线相当，双语指令调优使韩语推理和话语连贯性接近母语水平。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以可靠地支持长期预训练而不导致模型崩溃，双语指令调优能实现接近母语的推理能力，为未来多语言LLM研究建立了可复现的先例。

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在处理交通事故叙述时存在局限性：BERT等模型在推理密集型任务上表现不佳，闭源LLM存在隐私问题且缺乏领域知识，而现有工具难以批量处理非标准化的文本内容。

Method: 采用微调技术，使用低秩自适应(LoRA)和BERT向语言模型注入任务特定知识，针对碰撞方式和车辆碰撞类型识别两个目标进行优化。

Result: 在权威的真实世界数据集CISS上的实验表明，经过微调的紧凑模型在性能上超越了GPT-4o等强大的闭源LLM，同时仅需极少的训练资源。

Conclusion: 紧凑型开源PLM能够有效支持从交通事故叙述中进行推理密集型提取，不仅能捕获更丰富的叙述细节，还能纠正数据集中的错误标注。

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Motivation: 尽管开源LLM激增，但训练数据访问受限且规模庞大难以分析，特别是可能包含从互联网抓取的关键数据。

Method: 利用Elasticsearch并行索引和Alps基础设施（arm64超级集群），构建全文索引管道来索引LLM训练数据。

Result: 成功索引8.6T tokens（共15.2T），证明Elasticsearch可在arm64架构上运行，大规模全文索引可行，并能实现越狱无关的LLM安全。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模数据索引提供了有用参考，并促进向绿色计算的转型。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Motivation: 尽管神经网络模型取得了显著进展，但其泛化能力仍然是关键挑战。本文旨在区分逻辑推理中组合性和递归性这两个基本方面，并研究预训练大语言模型在这两方面的表现差异。

Method: 使用三段论片段作为自然语言推理的基准，评估LLMs的逻辑泛化能力。为了克服LLMs的局限性，提出了一种整合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构，通过协同交互实现稳健高效的推理。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在递归性方面表现出合理熟练度，但在组合性方面存在显著困难。实验表明，即使使用相对较小的神经组件，混合架构仍能保持高效率。

Conclusion: 混合模型具有有效解决神经推理系统中关键泛化障碍的潜力，符号推理确保完整性，而神经组件加速处理，这种协同作用为构建可靠的逻辑证明器提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 作为首个多模态策略内化工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，促进未来研究。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无标签情况下评估NLP模型跨域性能排名的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据漂移或零样本基线方法产生更一致和更强的排名相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化到不同领域时，需要在无标签情况下估计模型性能。现有方法基于数据集相似性或预测正确性，但它们在跨域时产生可靠性能排名的条件尚不明确。

Method: 采用两步评估设置：使用四个基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集的15个领域上进行实验，比较基于大语言模型的错误预测器与基于漂移和零样本基线方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于大语言模型的错误预测器与真实准确率具有更强和更一致的排名相关性。当跨域性能差异较大且错误模型的预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时，排名更可靠。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了性能估计方法在跨域模型评估中可被信任的条件，为其使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变ASR框架，通过口音分类器识别关键区域并掩码，用于数据增强，提高ASR模型对口音变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练transformer模型在ASR中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率较高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别关键区域并进行掩码，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 在英语和波斯语实验中，使用Whisper模型验证了掩码和数据增强策略能显著降低词错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了多语言ASR系统的发展，使其对口音和方言多样性具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: 提出GRSP方法，通过段级惩罚机制解决大型推理模型过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法中的惩罚机制过于简单，在减少token消耗的同时往往损害模型性能，需要更细粒度的监督来平衡效率与准确性。

Method: 提出Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP)，基于推理段落的长度感知加权机制，在段级进行正则化。

Result: GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提高token效率，尤其在困难问题上表现更优，并能稳定RL训练且在不同模型规模下有效扩展。

Conclusion: 监督粒度对平衡推理效率与准确性至关重要，GRSP提供了一种有效的段级正则化方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MulTypo是一个多语言拼写错误生成算法，用于评估LLM在包含拼写错误的输入下的鲁棒性。研究发现拼写错误会显著降低模型性能，特别是在生成式和推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，但现有基准测试大多假设输入是干净的，因此需要评估LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发了MulTypo算法，基于语言特定的键盘布局和打字行为模拟人类拼写错误，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务上的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，生成式和推理任务受影响最严重；指令微调提升干净输入性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)在强化学习中对齐人类偏好时的策略梯度偏差问题，通过同时使用对数似然的上界和下界来改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型因其并行解码能力而成为自回归模型的高效替代方案，但由于其难以处理的似然函数，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好对齐，现有基于ELBO的替代方法存在显著的策略梯度偏差。

Method: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比仅使用ELBO或一步估计的基线方法更加准确。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：在GSM8K上准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个数学推理任务上取得了显著性能提升，为扩散模型的对齐提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 本文识别了扩散大语言模型中的并行-顺序矛盾（PSC），该矛盾限制了DLLMs在复杂推理任务中的并行解码能力，导致其退化为类似自回归的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然提供了高吞吐量和有效的顺序推理，但其并行解码与因果顺序要求存在冲突，影响了推理质量和效率。

Method: 通过行为分析识别PSC问题，引入三个扩展维度（并行、扩散、顺序），并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解措施。

Result: 实验显示DLLMs仅在直接可判定的输出中表现出真正的并行性，随着任务难度增加会退化为自回归行为，且自回归提示会显著增加解码步骤而不改善质量。

Conclusion: PSC限制了DLLMs的自我反思、推理深度和探索广度，需要通过并行导向的方法来缓解这一矛盾带来的无效性和低效率。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: 提出一个多阶段框架来解决多语言医学视频检索任务，通过语义分块、知识图谱增强和分层索引实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗粒度嵌入，要么细粒度匹配成本过高，需要平衡检索精度和效率。

Method: 将视频字幕分成语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建分层树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入，采用粗到细的树搜索和轻量级LLM重排序。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进的性能，消融研究证实了KG增强、分层索引和LLM重排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究多语言CoT推理，评估了性能、一致性和忠实性三个维度，发现推理轨迹的质量和效果在不同语言间差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型依赖逐步推理链来提升任务性能，但在多语言环境中，推理轨迹本身（即导致最终答案的中间步骤）仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过测量语言遵从性、答案准确性和一致性来评估LRM在目标语言中的表现；通过跨语言交换推理轨迹评估一致性；采用截断和错误注入等扰动技术探测推理轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 发现模型对语言有强烈偏好，不同语言间性能差异明显；推理轨迹的质量和效果因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对推理轨迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言CoT推理存在显著的语言差异，需要更深入的研究来理解跨语言推理行为，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 构建包含8,880个刺激的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估17个不同规模和训练方式的语言模型在新实体推理任务上的表现。

Result: 发现对语言模型进行推理行为调优能显著提升大多数连接词的表现，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上都系统性表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Motivation: 随着同行评审研究数量激增，学者们越来越依赖社交平台发现研究，而作者需要投入大量精力推广工作以确保可见性和引用。为简化这一过程并减少人力依赖，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出PRAgent多智能体框架，通过三个阶段实现AutoPR：多模态内容提取、协作合成生成精炼输出、平台特定适配以优化规范、语气和标签。同时发布PRBench多模态基准数据集，从保真度、参与度和对齐度三个维度评估系统。

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research

TL;DR: Dyna-Mind是一个两阶段训练框架，通过教导AI代理在推理中整合模拟来增强其在复杂交互环境中的表现。第一阶段ReSim训练代理从真实经验中生成结构化推理轨迹，第二阶段Dyna-GRPO使用强化学习进一步强化模拟和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在数学和编码方面表现出专家级能力，但在长视野交互任务（如网页导航和计算机/手机使用）中表现不佳。受人类认知启发，需要让AI代理具备"替代性试错"能力，即在行动前心理模拟替代未来，以增强对复杂交互环境的理解和表现。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1) ReSim阶段：通过环境交互收集真实经验，构建扩展搜索树，训练代理生成结构化推理轨迹，使其推理基于真实世界动态并能够预测未来状态；2) Dyna-GRPO阶段：在线强化学习方法，使用结果奖励和中间状态作为反馈来加强模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试（Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld）上的实验表明：1) ReSim有效将模拟能力注入AI代理；2) Dyna-GRPO利用结果和交互级信号学习更好的长视野、规划密集型任务策略。

Conclusion: 模拟在使AI代理能够在日益挑战的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动中起着核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Conclusion: 该工作有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Motivation: 传统方法需要大量人工标注的推理数据集，成本高昂且资源密集。P-TTS旨在通过少量示例和推理时数据增强来低成本提升LLM推理能力。

Method: 使用仅90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变提示强度在测试时合成多样化的推理轨迹上下文，然后对Qwen-2.5模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，P-TTS-7B和32B模型显著优于基线方法，在AIME'24上分别获得+26.66%和+30.00%的绝对准确率提升，同时在零样本泛化任务中也表现出色。

Conclusion: P-TTS提供了一种实用、低成本的方案来激发LLM的推理潜力，特别适用于资源受限或快速发展的领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### [110] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM只需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，解决传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配或超越了需要更多数据的CNN基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在视觉任务中具有出色的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境下的跨模态学习提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，能够在保持图像-文本对齐的同时显著降低记忆化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆和复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致图像与提示对齐不佳，需要促进更早逃离记忆化吸引盆。

Method: 基于初始噪声样本决定逃离时间的观察，提出两种缓解策略：集体或个体调整初始噪声，寻找和使用能促进更早逃离吸引盆的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声在决定记忆化逃离时间中起关键作用，通过适当调整初始噪声可以有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的表征偏见，重点关注职业场景中的性别刻板印象，比较了DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成可视化研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了表征偏见问题。随着AI图像工具广泛使用，解决有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和专业场景中的多样性表征至关重要。

Method: 通过生成超过750张职业相关的AI图像，使用主题分析方法评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram在性别表征方面的表现，同时讨论了年龄和情感等话题。

Result: 研究发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要采取措施增加可见性别图像生成时的多样性表征，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了具体建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成动态专家混合路由器的视觉自回归模型，通过尺度感知阈值策略减少计算冗余，在保持图像质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在生成高分辨率图像时存在计算冗余问题，因为需要在不断增加的分辨率上重复调用Transformer，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 在VAR中集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略，根据token复杂度和分辨率平衡专家选择，无需额外训练。

Result: 实现了20%的FLOPs减少、11%的推理速度提升，同时保持了与密集基线相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [115] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中有效识别未知物体，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但混淆了认知不确定性（模型）和偶然不确定性（数据），导致将模糊的分布内区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 采用层次贝叶斯建模GMM参数在深度神经网络特征空间中的认知不确定性，无需辅助数据集或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上显著优于现有基于不确定性的方法：AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降低到40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 提出的层次贝叶斯方法能有效分离认知和偶然不确定性，在无监督OOD检测中取得显著性能提升，为LiDAR点云语义分割中的未知物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够以最先进的精度识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在无法逾越的差距：生活中执行的活动范围与用于训练的标注传感器数据集所能捕获的活动范围之间存在差异。未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱任何HAR分类器的可靠性。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时允许将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行来自不同背景的19种活动数据，该数据集完全公开可供下载。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还提供了超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察力，为未来开放集HAR研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于无监督聚类和S变换的新型高频振荡自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内能区分HFOs、尖峰、背景活动和伪迹，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的敏感度和98.57%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFOs耗时费力且主观性强，迫切需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 采用无监督聚类技术对S变换提取的时频域事件进行分类，在80-500Hz频段检测涟漪和快速涟漪，区分HFOs与其他活动。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率达0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速涟漪）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了DINOv2视觉模型的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念字典，揭示了模型在不同任务中的功能专门化，并提出了基于凸混合原型的Minkowski表示假说来解释视觉变换器的表示结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制仍然未知。研究旨在理解该模型的表示本质，超越简单的线性表示假说。

Method: 采用线性表示假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000单元的概念字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现分类任务利用"他处"概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单目深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说，认为标记是通过凸混合原型组合形成的，这种结构基于概念空间理论，为解释视觉变换器表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，无法有效处理遥感图像采集过程中的复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器和频率感知退化分解器，从流形几何和频率角度分析退化特征，并引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四个修复任务中均取得优越性能，全面超越现有最优方法，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，在保持高质量修复的同时获得了显著的效率提升。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful

Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。Puffin旨在统一这两个方向，扩展相机维度的空间感知能力。

Method: 引入将相机视为语言的新范式，使用语言回归和扩散生成方法，在Puffin-4M数据集上训练，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视图任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结内部网络结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中取得竞争性结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层的方法虽然计算高效，但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据极少时仍容易过拟合

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数将模型定制到特定数据

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务上使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络进行评估，相比已有基准取得了竞争性结果

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，易于应用于各种网络组件，在迁移学习任务中具有广泛适用性

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统性评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖从低级指向、轨迹理解到高级规划等6个类别。同时提出BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLM的评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性。BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: BEAR基准填补了MLLM具身能力评估的空白，BEAR-Agent有效提升了模型性能，且改进具身能力有益于模拟环境中的具身任务。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物视觉机制（中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多区域图像，在分类前重建图像以消除对抗噪声，无需重新训练下游分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具备对抗扰动的鲁棒性。假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充。使用强化学习引导眼跳选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周区域，整合成重建图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对各种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性地解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的超分辨率效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，计算开销大。线性注意力提供线性复杂度解决方案，但由于训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡等挑战，在超分辨率领域应用受限。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用信噪比混合专家架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 基于"精度优先于数量"原则建立轻量级TAG引导范式。

Result: LinearSR在单步扩散前向传播中达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力，同时提供最先进的感知质量和卓越效率。

Conclusion: 该工作为在逼真超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于计算机视觉的无监督方法，从卡卡鹦鹉视频中提取高质量关键帧，用于个体识别和重识别，替代传统侵入性标记方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入性、高效的自动识别方法。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，构建无监督关键帧提取流程。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在卡卡鹦鹉重识别任务中达到了高准确率。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入性方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个基于代理的通用视频质量评估框架，通过多层级模型路由系统动态选择和集成专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型在泛化性、可解释性和可扩展性方面的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型存在三个主要问题：(1) 对不同内容和任务的泛化能力差，包括用户生成内容、短视频和AI生成内容；(2) 可解释性有限；(3) 缺乏对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多样化专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重量级层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，同时显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在Q-Bench-Video基准上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够作为视频生成模型后训练阶段的奖励函数，为视频质量评估提供了灵活且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐、硬负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，缺乏统一解决方案，且可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 多级模态对齐的统一方案；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等主流Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最优方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决模态对齐、硬负样本和知识融合等关键挑战，显著提升了医学视觉问答的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，只在需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益很少，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，只对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: 这种简单而有效的策略在标准和一步扩散超分辨率模型中都能保持感知质量，同时显著减少计算量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临感知瓶颈和token过载的挑战，因为视频包含密集且时间延展的视觉输入，超出了图像模型的处理能力。

Method: D-CoDe框架包含两个核心组件：动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在各种基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，在挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe展示了处理复杂视频语言任务的潜力，为视频大语言模型的构建提供了有效的训练免费适应方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像进行分类，但会引入遮挡噪声且计算成本高、推理速度慢

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上AP50达到35.7，比先前方法快6.0-152.2倍

Conclusion: FOLK方法成功解决了现有开放词汇3D实例分割方法的噪声和效率问题

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和场景，为作物生长监测提供了无需标注的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上的ℓ₁-乘积度量方法，能够同时表达概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合语义结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗，车）。虽然双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP采用双曲因子笛卡尔积上的ℓ₁-乘积度量，其中概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中体现，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积结构成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新颖的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射其语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本表现出显著脆弱性，但现有的对抗攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。复杂的情境依赖性和代理模型与目标模型之间的特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 提出SegTrans框架，将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射其语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留原始输入的局部语义信息而非全局语义信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，且不引入额外计算开销。

Conclusion: SegTrans相比当前最先进方法，平均提高了8.55%的迁移攻击成功率，计算效率提升了100%以上，为分割模型的迁移攻击提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than

*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解对图像修复模型内部特征图进行扰动，防止知识蒸馏攻击，在保持教师模型性能的同时显著降低学生模型学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对分类任务，难以扩展到图像修复这类生成任务。图像修复输出连续高维且依赖空间一致性，微小扰动不足以阻止学生模型学习底层映射。

Method: ASVP基于奇异值分解，放大特征图的前k个奇异值，注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在5个图像修复任务上测试，ASVP使学生模型PSNR降低达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为开源图像修复模型提供了有效的知识蒸馏防御方案，相比现有方法具有更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: Ro-Bench是首个评估多模态大语言模型在动态分布外反事实视频测试集上的基准，通过编辑视频的风格、物体、背景及其组合来创建高质量、多样化的反事实视频数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在各种视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵的视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准，通过编辑视频的风格、物体、背景及其组合来生成高质量、多样化的反事实视频数据，评估8个最新的视频MLLM模型。

Result: 当前模型在Ro-Bench上面对反事实视频内容时表现出显著的性能下降。使用反事实数据进行微调后，模型在Ro-Bench上的性能提升了21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务中提升了12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，强调了在视频理解任务中使用反事实数据的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 现代农业监测系统依赖多源数据，但无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，包括动物小、遮挡、部分可见等场景特定问题。迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大数据集而效果有限。

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架：分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术生成真实多样的场景，专门针对动物健康监测的数据受限环境。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能支持实时动物健康监测解决方案，弥合了有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: DisTANCE基准测试显示LVLMs在视觉估计任务中精度有限，推理时缩放仅带来边际收益。作者提出感知时缩放(PTS)范式，通过丰富感知token和分解复杂问题来提升感知精度，将高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模，导致推理时缩放对视觉感知提升有限。

Method: 提出感知时缩放(PTS)范式，鼓励丰富感知token，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS显著提升感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好，且与数学推理数据结合能同时提升推理和真实世界感知能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token和增强对图像token的关注，使感知与推理时缩放对齐，显著提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断身体关节，过度依赖先验知识会降低手势和活动识别等下游任务的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，增强预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出，添加关节描述符来显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提高达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式估计关节感知可能性和位置可靠性，有效提高了毫米波姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有的多向量检索方法虽然通过分解查询和图像分割提高了精度，但仍存在对齐不足和冗余计算的问题。

Method: 提出分层范式使用多个中间粒度匹配不同图像对象，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算，并自动配置数据集参数。

Result: HiMIR不仅显著提高了检索精度，还将计算量减少了最多3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层多粒度匹配和优化计算效率，在多模态检索中实现了精度和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成图像中手部区域的质量评估任务HandEval，通过HandPair数据集训练，在多种下游应用中显著提升了手部生成真实性和AIGC检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（尤其是人手）的细节生成上仍存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理问题，而手部质量评估研究严重缺失，限制了人像生成优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k张高质量与低质量手部图像对），开发基于多模态大语言模型的手部质量评估模型HandEval，融入手部关键点先验知识，并构建人工标注测试集验证评估能力。

Result: HandEval在人工标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，在图像生成和AIGC检测应用中分别显著提升了手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval是首个针对生成手部质量评估的有效解决方案，在下游应用中展现出普适有效性，为提升文本到图像模型的手部生成质量提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

TL;DR: 提出首个防御性范例"不可着色样本"，通过在灰度图像中嵌入不可察觉的扰动来阻止未经授权的AI着色。方法PAChroma通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化扰动保持感知质量，并应用多样化输入变换增强跨模型迁移性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售。目前缺乏有效方法防止此类滥用。

Method: Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)：优化不可察觉扰动，使用拉普拉斯滤波器保持感知质量，在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换以增强迁移性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权感知防御开辟了道路。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传播才能生成单张图像，效率低下。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传播次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归模型推理效率低的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出对抗扰动方法识别不确定视觉token，并在视觉编码器的中间层自注意力过程中屏蔽这些token，抑制其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来识别和屏蔽不确定视觉token，是缓解物体幻觉问题的简单有效策略。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略能够有效解决自回归图像生成中的采样问题，在保持高质量的同时显著提升生成效率。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在领域偏移下会进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化问题尚未探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出最先进的性能，证明了在噪声标签下LiDAR语义分割领域泛化的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

*Weijia Wang,Yuanzhi Su,Pei-Gen Ye,Yuan-Gen Wang,Xuequan Lu*

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit是一个基于状态空间模型的点云法向量估计框架，通过注意力驱动的层次特征融合和补丁状态空间模型，有效建模细粒度几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并设计补丁状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强局部几何上下文学习和细粒度几何理解，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标和频繁遮挡等问题仍挑战现有方法的检测精度和轨迹连续性。

Method: 提出GL-DT框架，采用时空特征融合模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协作检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: 将密集的Diffusion Transformer转换为混合专家(MoE)结构，通过结构化稀疏化减少激活参数60%，同时保持原始性能，超越基于剪枝的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型参数量大导致推理开销大，现有参数压缩方法主要关注剪枝，但激进剪枝会因模型容量减少导致性能严重下降。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少FFN激活参数62.5%；提出混合块(MoB)选择性激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于COVID-19 CT图像诊断的多分支ConvNeXt架构，通过整合全局平均池化、全局最大池化和注意力加权池化三个分支，在验证集上取得了0.9937 ROC-AUC的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像的智能分析在临床诊断中至关重要，特别是识别细微的病理特征。本文旨在开发一个专门针对医学图像分析挑战的通用框架。

Method: 采用多分支ConvNeXt架构，整合三个并行分支的特征提取：全局平均池化、全局最大池化和新的注意力加权池化机制。使用端到端流程，包括数据预处理、增强和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在2,609个CT切片组成的验证集上，模型达到ROC-AUC 0.9937、验证准确率0.9757、COVID-19病例F1分数0.9825，优于所有先前报告的模型。

Conclusion: 现代多分支架构结合仔细的数据处理，可以实现与或超越当前最先进模型相当的性能，证明了先进深度学习技术在稳健医学诊断中的有效性。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和参考表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组任务需要大量标注数据，但真实数据标注成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心的组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上超越了在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位上提升+8.4 NAcc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力。将合成对象片段增强到LVIS和COCO中，在各种真实数据规模下都表现强劲，在极度有限真实数据下增益更大。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型MSDM，通过整合细胞核形态、颜色特征和元数据来生成逼真的图像-掩码对，解决计算病理学中细胞核分割标注数据稀缺问题，显著提升分割模型性能。


<details>

Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 开发多模态语义扩散模型MSDM，通过细胞核形态图、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的元数据进行条件生成，使用多头交叉注意力整合异质模态，实现精细控制生成图像。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物学条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入Wasserstein距离较低。合成样本显著提升了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，通过张量积构造实现完全核分解，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性问题，特别是在大阶数时，Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角度处理，导致效率低下。

Method: 采用张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角度基，实现独立的径向和角度处理，构建可分离的正交变换。

Result: 将计算复杂度从O(n^3N^2)到O(n^6N^2)降低到O(N^2 log N)，内存需求从O(N^4)降低到O(N^2)，条件数缩放从O(N^4)降低到O(√N)。

Conclusion: PSepT在数值稳定性、计算效率和分类性能方面表现优异，为高阶矩分析开辟了新可能性，适用于稳健的图像分析应用。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法通常单独归因于输入特征或训练样本，作者认为应联合研究这两种视角，探索测试预测与训练数据具体区域的关系。

Method: 训练特征归因方法，通过将测试预测归因到特定训练图像的具体区域，揭示深度模型的内部工作机制。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，该方法能识别导致错误分类的有害样本，并揭示传统归因方法无法发现的伪相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因提供了细粒度、测试特定的解释，有助于更好地理解深度神经网络的工作原理。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Method: 开发基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅在幻影数据上训练，无需患者CT扫描，通过图像处理实现支气管树的拓扑定位。

Result: 该方法在真实数据测试序列上表现优于现有方法，特别是在真实数据上展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的图像支气管镜拓扑定位方法能够有效提供导航辅助，无需CT扫描和额外设置，降低了成本并简化了操作流程。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Motivation: 实例级识别需要细粒度标注，但大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了实际应用。需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 从多个领域合成生成多样化对象实例，包含不同条件和背景，构建大规模训练集，不依赖任何真实图像。

Result: 在七个跨领域ILR基准测试中，基于生成数据微调的基础视觉模型检索性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR提供了高效有效的数据收集替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可生成训练数据，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放集检测框架，不仅识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法提供更有用的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于封闭世界假设，无法处理现实场景中的未知物体。现有的开放集检测方法仅将未知物体标记为'Unknown'，这在安全关键场景中信息不足，需要更细粒度的分类。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性、层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督、分类模块学习层次关系。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功解决了开放集检测中未知物体分类粒度不足的问题，为安全关键应用提供了更实用的决策信息。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合在边缘设备上部署，代码将开源以便于低功耗硬件部署。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial

study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP模型的多模态深度学习框架，通过语义线索改进牛只行为识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的总体准确率，并在少样本学习场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康和生产力的重要指标，现有视频监控方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能不足的问题，需要开发更有效的识别方法。

Method: 基于CLIP模型构建多模态框架，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门设计的文本提示，以弥合预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习达到96.1%总体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本学习场景中表现出鲁棒的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，通过专门设计的时空注意力机制来提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个具体实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器，通过多尺度特征处理来探索瞬态数据的局部和全局相关性，构建具有高表示能力的深度特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS都显著优于现有方法，同时贡献了大规模合成LOS数据集和真实NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构为光子效率成像提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过专门的注意力设计提升了3D重建性能，并丰富了该领域的数据资源。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [166] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让Diffusion Transformer从自身生成的错误中学习，解决训练与推理之间的假设差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻累积误差，但仅限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。核心挑战在于训练假设（基于干净数据）与自回归推理现实（基于自生成、易出错输出）之间的根本差异。

Method: 提出错误回收微调：1) 注入DiT历史错误干预干净输入，模拟流匹配中的误差累积轨迹；2) 通过一步双向积分高效近似预测，用残差计算误差；3) 在离散时间步动态存储错误到回放记忆，为新输入重采样。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM是一个跨域序列推荐框架，利用大语言模型生成语义标签，通过多注意力机制建模用户跨域行为，在电商数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域推荐系统中需要同时捕获域内和跨域用户行为模式的问题，为用户提供个性化消费体验。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与项目标识符、文本和视觉特征融合构建增强的项目表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制建模用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成在面向消费者的推荐系统中具有显著优势，展示了LLM在消费电子领域推进智能用户中心服务的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源稀缺地区，肩部疾病如肩周炎等早期准确诊断面临挑战，急需低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断解决方案。

Method: 提出混合运动视频诊断框架HMVDx，将动作理解和疾病诊断两个任务分别由两个多模态大语言模型完成，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑过程的可用性指数新指标。

Result: 实验比较显示，HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了低成本多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的潜在价值，为未来MLLMs在医疗领域视频理解应用研究做出了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，对比了顶级开源视觉语言模型与专用模型在隐私预测方面的表现，发现尽管VLMs资源密集，但在准确性上仍落后于专用小模型，但在鲁棒性方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用任务的视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准进行公平比较，评估前3名开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，对比其性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs尽管参数多、推理慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专用小模型；VLMs对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测方面尚未超越专用模型，但在鲁棒性方面有优势，需要进一步研究提升其隐私预测能力。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 为了解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射学图像问答中容易产生幻觉的问题，需要一种可靠的方法来识别和过滤可能产生错误回答的问题。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，在温度1.0下对每个问题回答15次，通过双向蕴含检查将意义等效的回答分组，计算语义簇的相对频率得到DSE值，然后过滤高熵问题。

Result: 在过滤掉DSE>0.3的高熵问题后，GPT-4o的准确率从51.7%提升到76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升到63.8%，且统计显著。

Conclusion: DSE能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，通过量化语义不一致性显著提高了诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Result: 提出的框架自然融入关键时刻定位能力，在推理时密集采样信息时刻，稀疏采样非必要帧。

Conclusion: 该方法避免了外部时间戳编码需求，同时保持运动细节和全局上下文，提高了跟踪稳定性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似自然觅食的统计规律，视觉结构本身包含了可学习的关键注视行为特征

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Result: 实验显示配备描述的模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升至59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升至73.0%。CapGeo-Bench的评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，证明了通过几何描述辅助推理的有效性。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RadioFlow为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来解决自监督单目深度估计中语义-空间知识提取不足的问题，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而遇到性能限制，需要更有效地整合视觉先验和上下文信息。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net用于病理图像中的半监督细胞核实例分割，通过实例感知一致性正则化和形态学先验知识来提升分割精度，特别是在密集分布和重叠细胞核场景下。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和形态学先验知识的有效结合，成功解决了半监督细胞核实例分割中的关键挑战，为病理图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: PPFN方法有效解决了热红外图像增强中的耦合退化问题，建立了高质量多场景红外基准数据集，为热红外图像处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的基于视觉语言模型的多模态关键词预测方法，特别是动态CoT策略，能够有效提升模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文，缺乏对纯视觉推理能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对和标注推理链的基准，评估20个领先的多模态大语言模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战，语言空间的推理策略（如思维链）能提升性能但产生不稳定和冗余推理，重复图像观察和主动视觉交互显示需要新的视觉推理范式。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的视觉推理范式来应对BLINK-Twice提出的挑战，强调从视觉内容进行推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在无边界动态城市环境中对初始化点云质量的依赖问题，避免因部分初始化点云导致的失真和伪影。

Method: 使用体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构，通过多样性感知视图选择信息丰富的支持视图，利用基于块匹配的多视角立体重建恢复缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象的重建几何质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够生成由可靠几何先验引导的新高斯基元，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能有效恢复几何结构。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR能捕获3D森林结构，但直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量存在挑战，因为需要建模长程依赖关系来区分树木。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系以改进树木区分。加入跳跃连接来增强特征并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清查技术。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，需要利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来减少计算量。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: MGS实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在COCO数据集上保持或改进性能的同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，无需完整模型重新训练即可实现预训练视觉Transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor通过语言嵌入表示和精确定位策略，成功解决了4D场景文本驱动编辑的挑战，为动态场景编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过有效利用时序信息，在低光视频增强任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了林业感知数据空白，证明了在复杂自然环境中树种分类的难度，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于DreamBooth的少样本角色生成方法，通过多token策略和LoRA微调，从少量参考角色生成无限新角色，同时保持艺术风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画、游戏等领域从少量参考角色生成无限新角色的需求，同时保持艺术风格和视觉特征的延续性。

Method: 基于DreamBooth框架，采用多token策略（为单个角色和集体风格分配独立token），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机token和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上评估，定量指标和人工评估均显示方法能生成高质量、多样化角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了少样本角色生成问题，在保持艺术风格一致性的同时实现了无限角色创造，展现了在创意产业中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Motivation: 当前交互式医学图像分割评估存在不一致和临床不现实的问题，阻碍了公平比较并误导了真实世界性能评估。

Method: 提出了临床基础的评估任务和指标定义方法学，并开发了用于构建标准化评估管道的软件框架。

Result: 发现最小化用户交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性至关重要，自适应缩放机制提升鲁棒性和收敛速度，验证提示行为/预算与训练不一致会导致性能下降，2D方法在板状图像和粗目标上表现良好但3D上下文有助于大或不规则形状目标，非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状时性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立标准化临床评估框架对于准确评估交互式医学图像分割算法的真实世界性能至关重要，揭示了影响算法性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: PhysToolBench是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具理解能力的基准测试，包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，测试工具识别、理解和创造三个难度级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化MLLMs对物理工具的真实理解程度，填补现有评估空白，因为工具使用能力是通用智能体的关键技能。

Method: 构建包含三个难度级别的VQA数据集：工具识别（识别主要功能）、工具理解（理解操作原理）、工具创造（用周围物品创造新工具）。评估了32个MLLMs模型。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在工具理解和创造能力上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs对物理工具的理解能力有限，需要进一步改进。提供了深入分析和初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影现象及其对基于PRNU的相机源验证系统的影响，特别是在法证应用场景下。

Method: 通过分析不同三星手机型号的图像数据，识别对角线伪影模式，比较原始图像和经过处理图像的PRNU验证效果。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列机型共享导致指纹碰撞的通用模式，类似问题也存在于部分Galaxy A机型；原始图像可绕过引入伪影的处理流程，实现可靠PRNU验证。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影在法证应用中具有潜在价值，可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式中受合成虚化影响的区域，但中端A系列机型无法使用原始图像捕获是个限制。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标检测，包含渐进式细化颈部和增强切片采样两个模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法重建的细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架：1）渐进式细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；2）增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化重排和卷积在下采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效解决了航拍图像小目标检测中的信息退化问题，在实时性和准确性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

TL;DR: FLOWING是一个基于微分向量流的变形框架，通过将变形重新定义为流构造来确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性，在2D图像和3D形状变形中实现高质量结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLPs)作为隐式神经表示在建模变形时依赖昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定和特征对齐困难，需要更稳定和准确的方法。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像变形以及高斯溅射变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，并具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FLOWING提供了一种基于流的变形方法，能够产生稳定、准确且结构保持的变形效果，优于传统MLP方法。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种动态条件控制的扩散模型框架，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器来调整模型权重，实现随时间变化的参数化控制，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成质量和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控扩散模型使用固定的架构和静态条件策略来修改中间激活，这种静态方法无法适应多阶段去噪过程中从粗到细的动态生成需求，限制了模型根据生成阶段调整响应策略的能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络基于时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接条件化模型权重而非中间激活，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提升了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过更深层的权重功能适配来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

<details>

Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，需要能够处理少样本、开放集和跨任务场景的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR在少样本和开放集场景下显著优于现有少样本和基于原型的检测器。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Method: 两阶段训练策略：1) 轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到动作空间；2) 选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。添加动作token和状态编码器来整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。真实世界实验中在5个操作任务上达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏能有效使VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在仿真和真实世界任务中都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个为实时处理无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练和推理框架，使用KV缓存重用机制实现高效的长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的方法。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存，重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token和文本token。通过简单的监督微调策略，在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM对GPT-4O mini的胜率达到66.18%，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能。同时，SFT策略还提升了通用VQA能力，在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM通过创新的KV缓存重用和SFT训练策略，成功实现了对无限视频流的实时稳定理解，同时提升了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的世界模型，将视觉前瞻和导航规划集成在单一多模态自回归框架中，通过层次化记忆机制实现长期稳定的推理，显著提升了视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在新颖或动态场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架来确保预测与控制的紧密对齐。

Method: 提出UniWM统一模型，集成自我中心视觉前瞻和规划，采用层次化记忆机制结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，实现扩展视野内的稳定推理。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著降低，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性进展，证明了视觉想象与行动决策紧密集成的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

### [202] [Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09038)
*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长任务和分布偏移下持续提升成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件精确尺寸和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来泛化不同界面和长任务。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、合成任务、执行轨迹和验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理在长任务和分布偏移下的性能，以低成本实现与顶级闭源模型相当的竞争力。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，通过特征空间目标和正交随机扰动来增强流式文本到图像模型的多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，该扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束使其能够增强变化而不降低图像细节或提示保真度。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法理论上被证明能够单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，这为生成质量稳健保持提供了原则性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出使用大语言模型(LLMs)来评估车辆路径规划(VRP)生成的配送路线，以解决印度电商最后一公里配送中的实际问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因地址不规范、地图不完整和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发了一个框架，使用LLMs根据政策标准来评估VRP生成的路线，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。生成了400个案例进行标注和评估。

Result: 开源LLMs识别路线问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高达到86%。LLM评估超越了传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路线评估可以成为有效且可扩展的评估层，对提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性具有重要意义，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成更鲁棒和性能更好的启发式算法，相比现有技术有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法可能不够鲁棒，需要工具来解释启发式算法表现不佳的原因并提供改进建议，从而生成更有效的算法。

Method: 采用三个简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的特定区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法在最坏情况下性能比FunSearch提高了约28倍，平均性能也有所提升，同时保持了运行时间。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性设计，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能，这为自动化算法设计提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [206] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI在评估文学风格时都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在，且评价标准会因作者身份标签而逆转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，以及是否存在归因偏见。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验。研究1比较人类参与者和AI模型在盲评、准确标签和反事实标签条件下评估文学段落；研究2测试AI评估者和创作者14×14矩阵中的偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。研究2证实这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点）。归因标签导致评估标准逆转。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了这种人类倾向。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Gaurav Sahu,Hugo Larochelle,Laurent Charlin,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，通过系统化评估补充人类判断，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审中存在的不一致性、评审者主观性和可扩展性挑战，利用AI提供系统化和一致的评估来补充人类判断。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持使用专门的评审者角色和结构化评估标准进行系统实验，可部分或完全集成到实际会议工作流程中。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，GPT-OSS-120B模型达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审者平均83.9%的水平；AI生成的评审质量被LLM评为高于人类平均水平。

Conclusion: AI在事实核查、文献覆盖等方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足，需要与人类专家形成混合评审系统，AI增强一致性、覆盖面和公平性，而复杂评估留给领域专家。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取知识图谱的语义条件，深度融合知识到LLM中，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有prefix-tuning方法简单拼接知识嵌入和文本输入，忽略了知识图谱的丰富关系语义，给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用GNN从局部图邻域提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应调节文本嵌入，实现深度特征级知识感知交互。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛问题的基准测试，每个问题平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，用于评估大语言模型的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在缺乏挑战性问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面、高质量的评估基准。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的问题，每个问题配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，表现强劲但仍落后于顶尖人类选手（通常高于90百分位）；开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位，与前沿闭源模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先进行精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的实验设计方法，用于解决文本分析中的潜在混淆变量问题，避免传统LLM方法可能导致的覆盖偏差，并在政治沟通实验中验证了表达谦逊对说服力的因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会科学研究需要评估文本语言特性对受众态度和行为的因果影响，但由于文本属性相互关联，必须控制潜在混淆变量来隔离因果效应。传统LLM方法存在编码处理变量本身的风险。

Method: 引入新的实验设计方法，处理潜在混淆变量，避免覆盖问题，无偏估计处理效应。通过政治沟通实验评估表达谦逊的说服力效果。

Result: 方法学上证明基于LLM的方法比简单的词袋模型表现更差；实质研究发现表达谦逊对政治陈述的感知说服力具有因果效应。

Conclusion: 新实验设计有效解决了文本分析中的因果推断问题，为社交媒体平台、政策制定者和社会科学研究者提供了新的沟通效果见解。

Abstract: Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect
an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often
interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for
possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature
proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations
of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However,
because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods
risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself,
inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we
introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the
overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design
in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in
political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based
methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text
and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect
of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements,
offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms,
policy makers, and social scientists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义路由器，根据查询的推理需求选择性应用推理，在MMLU-Pro基准上实现10.2个百分点的准确率提升，同时减少47.1%的响应延迟和48.5%的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在增强推理模式时能显著提升准确率，但推理会带来高昂的推理延迟和token使用成本，这对许多简单提示来说是不必要的。

Method: 使用语义路由器对查询进行分类，基于其推理需求，仅在有益时选择性应用推理。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准上准确率提升10.2个百分点，响应延迟减少47.1%，token消耗减少48.5%。

Conclusion: 语义路由为开源LLM服务系统提供了在准确性和效率之间取得平衡的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial accuracy gains when
augmented with reasoning modes such as chain-of-thought and inference-time
scaling. However, reasoning also incurs significant costs in inference latency
and token usage, with environmental and financial impacts, which are
unnecessary for many simple prompts. We present a semantic router that
classifies queries based on their reasoning requirements and selectively
applies reasoning only when beneficial. Our approach achieves a 10.2 percentage
point improvement in accuracy on the MMLU-Pro benchmark while reducing response
latency by 47.1% and token consumption by 48.5% compared to direct inference
with vLLM. These results demonstrate that semantic routing offers an effective
mechanism for striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency in open-source
LLM serving systems

Motivation: 传统背景网格在几何贴合性、计算轻量性和避免伪影方面存在挑战，需要一种更优化的简化方法来提升网格生成效率。

Method: 使用图卷积网络模型预测最优边折叠候选，通过自定义损失函数综合考虑几何保真度和尺寸场精度，替代昂贵的程序化评估。

Result: 简化后的背景网格元素减少74%-94%，尺寸场查询时间降低35%-88%，在复杂工程模型中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动方法能够高效简化背景网格，显著提升非结构化网格生成的性能，为工程应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,
with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is
particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

Method: 开发Transformer编码模型，同时训练多被试的MEG和fMRI数据，通过潜在层重建皮层源信号。

Result: 模型在MEG预测上优于单模态编码模型，在仿真实验中比经典最小范数解具有更高的时空保真度，且能很好泛化到新被试和模态。

Conclusion: 通过整合大型自然实验、MEG、fMRI和编码模型，为实现毫秒-毫米级脑映射提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial
resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both
high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source
localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial
naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively
to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an
open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based
encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic
speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and
fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents
our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better
than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields
source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic
minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated
latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects
and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict
electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an
entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic
experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route
towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.

TL;DR: 本文评估开源大语言模型作为本地部署意图解析系统的可行性，与GPT-4进行性能比较，探索下一代操作系统的本地AI组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于云端专有模型的实现存在隐私、自主性和可扩展性限制，需要本地部署的开源模型来构建真正可信的语言优先交互界面。

Method: 对多个开源和开放访问模型进行能力评估，与OpenAI的GPT-4系统进行对比分析，测试其在生成用户意图工作流方面的性能。

Result: 研究提供了关于开源LLMs作为下一代操作系统本地可操作组件的实际可行性、性能权衡和潜力的实证见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持AI基础设施的去中心化和民主化，指向通过本地嵌入智能实现更无缝、自适应和隐私保护的用户设备交互的未来。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BigCodeArena是一个基于Chatbot Arena构建的代码生成人类评估平台，提供实时执行环境来评估LLM生成的代码质量。通过收集14,000多个代码对话会话，识别了4,700多个带有人类偏好的多轮样本，并开发了BigCodeReward和AutoCodeArena两个基准来系统评估LLM的代码能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在代码领域，手动评估LLM生成内容的质量极具挑战性，需要理解长代码片段并模拟代码执行过程。现有评估平台缺乏对代码执行环境的支持。

Method: 在Chatbot Arena基础上构建BigCodeArena平台，提供全面的实时执行环境，允许人类与代码执行过程和结果进行交互。收集了10个LLM在10种语言和8种执行环境中的14,000多个对话会话。

Result: 识别了4,700多个带有人类偏好的多轮样本，发现大多数LLM在有执行结果时能更好地判断编码偏好。专有LLM如GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Claude-Opus-4在代码生成性能上领先。

Conclusion: BigCodeArena为代码生成评估提供了有效的平台，AutoCodeArena基准可以在无需人类参与的情况下自动评估LLM的编码质量，专有LLM在代码生成方面仍保持领先地位。

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together

TL;DR: HES-SQL是一个创新的混合训练框架，通过思维模式融合的监督微调和组相对策略优化，提升Text-to-SQL生成性能，在保持准确性的同时优化查询执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text-to-SQL系统中语义准确性和计算效率之间的平衡问题，开发既能生成正确SQL查询又能保证执行效率的自然语言数据库接口。

Method: 结合思维模式融合的监督微调(SFT)和组相对策略优化(GRPO)，引入骨架完整性评分、查询延迟感知奖励系统和思维模式完成的自蒸馏过程。

Result: 在BIRD和KaggleDBQA基准测试上分别达到79.14%和54.9%的执行准确率，查询延迟相对监督基线提升11%-20%。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的Text-to-SQL系统范式，通过执行信息强化学习有效平衡语义准确性和计算效率，对自然语言数据库接口开发具有重要影响。

Abstract: We present HES-SQL, a novel hybrid training framework that advances
Text-to-SQL generation through the integration of thinking-mode-fused
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness
scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries
and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that
incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a
self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents
degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables
hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes
while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency.
  Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under
controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves
competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\% and 54.9\% on the
BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the
end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over
multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\% to 20\%
relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for
Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with
computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning
(RL). The proposed methodology has significant implications for developing
robust natural language interfaces to databases and can be extended to broader
structured generation tasks requiring both correctness and efficiency
optimization.

### [219] [Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269)
*Zirun Zhou,Zhengyang Xiao,Haochuan Xu,Jing Sun,Di Wang,Jingfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出目标导向后门攻击(GoBA)，通过在训练数据中注入物理触发器，使视觉-语言-动作模型在遇到物理触发器时执行预定义的目标动作，而正常输入下表现正常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型依赖未筛选的训练数据存在安全隐患，现有后门攻击大多假设白盒访问且仅导致任务失败而非执行特定动作。本文揭示更实际的威胁：通过注入物理对象作为触发器来操控VLA模型。

Method: 基于LIBERO基准构建BadLIBERO数据集，包含多样化物理触发器和目标导向后门动作。提出三级评估方法，将受害VLA在GoBA下的动作分为三个状态：无动作、尝试执行、成功执行。

Result: 实验显示，当物理触发器存在时，受害VLA在97%的输入中成功实现后门目标，而在干净输入上性能零下降。动作轨迹和触发器颜色显著影响攻击性能，触发器大小影响较小。

Conclusion: GoBA攻击展示了VLA模型对物理触发器后门攻击的脆弱性，强调了训练数据安全的重要性，并提供了BadLIBERO数据集供进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved
embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at
https://goba-attack.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了大型语言模型对间接提示注入攻击的脆弱性，发现即使已知攻击模式仍能成功，暴露了模型防御的持续弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地与外部数据源交互，间接提示注入成为一个关键且不断演变的攻击向量，使攻击者能够通过操纵输入来利用模型。

Method: 通过系统评估不同模型的间接提示注入攻击，分析当前LLMs对此类攻击的易感性，包括模型大小、制造商、具体实现等参数如何影响其脆弱性，以及哪些攻击方法最有效。

Result: 结果显示，即使已知的攻击模式仍然成功，暴露了模型防御的持续弱点。不同模型在对抗间接提示注入攻击方面表现出不同程度的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 需要加强训练程序以增强固有弹性，建立已知攻击向量的集中数据库以实现主动防御，以及统一的测试框架以确保持续的安全验证。这些步骤对于将安全性集成到LLMs核心设计中至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now routinely used to autonomously execute
complex tasks, from natural language processing to dynamic workflows like web
searches. The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both
their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact
with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and
evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through
manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt
injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current
LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and
manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which
attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known
attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model
defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for
strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized
database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified
testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are
essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design
of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate
long-standing threats.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性高但相似度差。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接重用低频分量特征，使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频分量。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存通过分别处理不同频率分量的特征，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

Motivation: 边缘环境中的实时多视角3D重建面临资源可用性动态变化、图像质量下降、网络不稳定等挑战，需要确保在合理时间内获得高质量重建结果。

Method: 采用两个协作的Q学习代理：一个负责相机选择，一个负责服务器选择，两者完全在线运行，通过与边缘环境交互学习策略。在包含实验室设备和FABRIC基础设施的分布式测试平台上评估系统性能。

Result: 该框架在动态环境中有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的多视角3D重建，为关键边缘应用提供支持。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，而忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，利用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，分布偏移下公平性更难维持。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，开发更稳健、公平的预后模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏分解方法识别视觉皮层三个通路（腹侧、背侧、外侧）的主要表征成分，发现它们具有不同的功能选择性。作者提出稀疏成分对齐（SCA）方法来衡量大脑与机器表征的对齐程度，发现标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在人类视觉皮层中具有不同功能通路的背景下，仅通过单一任务训练的深度神经网络却能很好地建模整个视觉系统，揭示不同视觉通路之间的计算原理差异。

Method: 使用新颖的稀疏分解方法识别各视觉通路的主导表征成分，并引入稀疏成分对齐（SCA）方法来衡量大脑与机器表征的对齐程度。

Result: 发现三个视觉通路的成分响应特征存在明显差异：腹侧通路对脸孔、场景、身体、文字和食物有选择性；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含运动和手部动作有选择性；背侧通路则包含一些难以解释的成分。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧和外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能够比传统群体水平几何方法更精细地揭示大脑与机器表征的对齐差异，提供了一种对系统潜在神经调谐轴敏感的表示对齐度量方法。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

TL;DR: 提出Meta-Policy Controller (MPC)框架，通过元学习动态调整KL散度系数和狄利克雷先验强度，解决传统EDL方法在动态数据分布中校准性能差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习(EDL)方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性能，改善了不确定性校准、预测准确性和置信度样本拒绝后的性能保持。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习机制有效解决了EDL方法在动态环境中的校准限制，提升了不确定性建模的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Motivation: 研究注意力机制中归一化过程的局限性，特别是softmax在token选择中的几何分离特性和训练稳定性问题，为改进注意力架构提供理论基础。

Method: 建立理论框架分析token选择的区分能力和几何分离，通过预训练GPT-2模型进行实验验证，研究注意力机制的关键行为。

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温设置下存在梯度敏感性挑战。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对基于softmax的注意力机制的理解，表明需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来改进未来注意力架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

TL;DR: BBQ是一个贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，通过显式建模评分者质量来改进生成模型的人类评估，提供更可靠和成本效益的排名方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准评估指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人工评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大。现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ框架，使用贝叶斯方法显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Result: BBQ实现了更快的收敛、良好校准的不确定性估计，与基线Bradley-Terry模型相比，即使在有噪声或众包评分者情况下也能获得更稳健、可解释的排名。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益的生成模型人类评估，解决了现有方法在鲁棒性和可解释性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态干预，解决LLM安全对齐中的过度拒绝问题，实现安全性和响应性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往只关注防范有害提示，导致模型过度谨慎，对良性提示也拒绝响应。需要同时提升安全性和减少错误拒绝。

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，为不良状态分配高能量，为理想状态分配低能量。推理时通过能量梯度动态引导LLM隐藏状态到低能量区域，实时修正响应。

Result: 在ORB-H基准测试中，合规率从57.3%提升至82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能，显著降低了错误拒绝率。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，使LLM既能实现低错误拒绝率，又能保持高安全性，且无需微调，计算开销小。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息，导致长序列或噪声序列中的效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。

Method: 使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等生成模型总结每个片段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够达到85-90%的完整模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本，并在噪声下提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一个模型无关的预处理器，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了一个原则性的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的细微风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于联邦学习。

Method: 提出了一个量化联邦学习中客户端内部和客户端之间记忆化的框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量方法，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和联邦学习算法等关键因素。

Result: 联邦学习模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内部数据比客户端之间数据更容易被记忆，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在跨样本记忆化风险，需要更细粒度的检测方法，记忆化程度受多种因素影响，客户端内部数据更容易被记忆。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的结构感知文本嵌入方法，通过在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合结构关系（如超链接、引用），而非依赖传统的后处理聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了现实数据中丰富的结构信息（如超链接、引用），这些结构信息在许多应用中提供关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法持续优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序连接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码（ATM）方法解决稀疏自编码器中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习更稳定的可解释特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持优秀的重构质量

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 提出RLER方法解决RLIR中的系统偏差问题，通过集成模型和自适应奖励插值实现稳定训练，在无标签样本上接近RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLIR在无标签设置下可实现可持续扩展，但其性能和稳定性落后于RLVR，主要原因是模型对高置信度轨迹的过度估计导致偏差和不稳定的奖励估计。

Method: 提出RLER方法：使用集成模型聚合多样性，采用自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择策略来缓解系统偏差。

Result: 实验显示RLER比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效解决了RLIR的系统偏差问题，实现了接近RLVR的性能，在无标签环境下具有高度适用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法仅限于文本，无法充分发挥多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过保持对齐的更新进行多模态提示联合优化，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Method: 1) 从多个渠道收集广泛的提示数据集；2) 选择代表性数据集进行系统性分析，揭示不同类别提示构建的共性与差异；3) 提出基于词性和依存结构句法嵌入的提示优化方法，通过识别提示的中心表示并引导LLM将提示重写向该中心来改进模型输出。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 现有RL方法在任务难度超过模型能力时会出现奖励稀疏和训练低效问题，先前工作使用离策略数据但往往误导策略更新，核心问题是训练亲和力低。

Method: 引入Affinity指标监控训练稳定性，提出HINT自适应提示框架，提供启发式提示而非直接答案，引导模型自主推理。

Conclusion: HINT通过改善训练亲和力有效解决了RL训练中的奖励稀疏问题，在保持模型自主推理能力的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: We introduce MMAudioSep, a generative model for video/text-queried sound
separation that is founded on a pretrained video-to-audio model. By leveraging
knowledge about the relationship between video/text and audio learned through a
pretrained audio generative model, we can train the model more efficiently,
i.e., the model does not need to be trained from scratch. We evaluate the
performance of MMAudioSep by comparing it to existing separation models,
including models based on both deterministic and generative approaches, and
find it is superior to the baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
even after acquiring functionality for sound separation via fine-tuning, the
model retains the ability for original video-to-audio generation. This
highlights the potential of foundational sound generation models to be adopted
for sound-related downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Conclusion: ControlAudio通过多任务学习和渐进式扩散建模成功解决了可控文本到音频生成的挑战，实现了高质量的细粒度控制生成。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在学术讲座等专业领域表现不佳，现有方法复杂且效果有限，OLLM模型在实践中容易退化为简单OCR系统。

Method: 提出Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)后训练方法，采用<think><answer>格式强制模型执行"先看后转录"的结构化推理过程，通过强化学习优化四个奖励目标。

Result: VAPO显著改善了领域特定术语的识别效果，建立了有效的端到端SlideASR范式。

Conclusion: VAPO方法成功解决了幻灯片ASR任务中的视觉信息利用问题，为多模态语音识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with
domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as
academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which
leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve
transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be
complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs)
provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by
degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To
overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel
post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing
on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured "Look
before Transcription" procedure using a <think><answer> format. Specifically,
the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then
generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information
in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement
learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy,
ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we
construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic
dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves
recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end
paradigm for SlideASR.

complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their
use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit
articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework
that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a
pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion
as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are
injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with
acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate
that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based
baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest
that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide
meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.

### [241] [Dynamic Stress Detection: A Study of Temporal Progression Modelling of Stress in Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08586)
*Vishakha Lall,Yisi Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出将心理压力建模为随时间演化的动态现象，通过情感标签生成细粒度压力标注，并使用交叉注意力序列模型来捕捉时间压力进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多将压力视为静态标签，而实际上压力是受历史情绪状态影响的动态现象，需要更精细的建模方法。

Method: 提出动态标注策略从情感标签生成细粒度压力标注，引入基于交叉注意力的序列模型（单向LSTM和Transformer编码器）来捕捉时间压力进展。

Result: 在MuSE数据集上准确率提升5%，在StressID数据集上提升18%，并在自定义真实世界数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将压力建模为动态结构在语音分析中具有重要价值，能够更准确地反映压力的时间演化特性。

Abstract: Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure
settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress
detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress
as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state.
We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress
annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based
sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture
temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on
MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to
a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling
stress as a dynamic construct in speech.

### [242] [BaldWhisper: Faster Whisper with Head Shearing and Layer Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08599)
*Yaya Sy,Christophe Cerisara,Irina Illina*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对低资源语言Bambara的Whisper模型剪枝方法，通过低秩分解和特征蒸馏压缩嵌入，合并层而非删除层，在仅32小时语音数据下实现48%模型缩小和2.15倍加速，保持90%原性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大预训练Transformer在低资源语言剪枝时面临的数据稀缺问题，避免像Distill-Whisper那样需要21000小时数据的重训练，使模型更适合边缘设备部署。

Method: 采用低秩分解和特征蒸馏压缩嵌入，合并模型层而不是删除层，避免词汇剪枝（因Bambara使用者频繁语码转换而不适用）。

Result: 最终模型在MacBook Air M1上实现48%模型大小减少和2.15倍速度提升，同时保持原始模型90%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据稀缺环境下的模型压缩提供了可行方案，成功在极有限数据条件下实现了高效的模型轻量化。

Abstract: Pruning large pre-trained transformers for low-resource languages is
challenging, as it often requires massive retraining data to recover
performance. For instance, Distill-Whisper prunes Whisper by 40% and retrains
on 21,000 hours of speech, far beyond what is available for most languages. Can
Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings?
Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new
pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to
frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with
low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers,
we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the
original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air
M1.

### [243] [Unsupervised lexicon learning from speech is limited by representations rather than clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09225)
*Danel Adendorff,Simon Malan,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文在理想化设置下研究了零资源分词和聚类系统的性能限制因素，发现表示变异性是主要瓶颈而非聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管零资源分词和聚类系统已有进展，但生成的词典仍不完美。研究旨在确定在已知词边界的情况下，性能限制主要来自词段表示还是聚类方法。

Method: 结合多种自监督语音特征（连续/离散、帧级/词级）与不同聚类方法（K-means、层次聚类、图聚类），在英语和普通话数据上进行实验。

Result: 最佳系统使用基于动态时间规整的图聚类与连续特征。表示变异性是限制性能的主要因素，而非聚类方法本身。

Conclusion: 研究表明，相同词类型词段之间的表示变异性是零资源分词和聚类系统性能的主要限制因素，这为未来改进方向提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Zero-resource word segmentation and clustering systems aim to tokenise speech
into word-like units without access to text labels. Despite progress, the
induced lexicons are still far from perfect. In an idealised setting with gold
word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of
word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like
types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features
(continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods
(K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best
system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features.
Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged
continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through
controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the
clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across
segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary
factor limiting performance.

TL;DR: 该研究针对多说话人对话音频中的目标说话人匿名化问题，提出了改进策略和评估方法，特别适用于呼叫中心等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有说话人匿名化研究主要针对单说话人音频，缺乏对多说话人对话场景的有效处理，特别是在只需匿名化特定目标说话人（如呼叫中心客户）的情况下。

Method: 探索多说话人对话音频中目标说话人匿名化的有效策略，识别开发过程中的潜在问题，并提出相应的改进评估方法。

Result: 研究揭示了传统匿名化方法在多说话人场景中的局限性，以及现有评估方法在准确衡量隐私保护和实用性方面的不足。

Conclusion: 该研究为多说话人对话音频中的目标说话人匿名化提供了新的解决方案和评估框架，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Most of the existing speaker anonymization research has focused on
single-speaker audio, leading to the development of techniques and evaluation
metrics optimized for such condition. This study addresses the significant
challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio,
specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This
scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer
privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with
operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this
task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately
assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario.
This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for
targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential
problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation
methodologies.

*Mathias Boulanger,Ericmoore Jossou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合时空隐式神经表示(INRs)和ADMM优化的动态X射线计算机断层扫描重建方法，在交错采集方案下实现了高效收敛和强健性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对动态X射线计算机断层扫描(XCT)在交错采集方案下的重建挑战，需要开发能够处理时空变化、噪声干扰和非理想探测器效应的重建方法。

Method: 结合ADMM优化与INCODE条件框架，利用隐式神经表示的归纳偏置，引入加权最小二乘数据保真项进行显式噪声建模，并扩展建模探测器非理想性和环形伪影校正。

Result: 在多种采集场景下均表现出色，优于最先进的TIMBIR方法，对中等噪声水平具有良好的鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法具有模块化特性，可扩展到4D体积重建，为大规模数据集处理提供了并行化可能性，是实用的重建框架。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural
Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach
combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework
incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our
method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global
undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and
noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and
outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a
state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the
inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels,
and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares
data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging
regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical
reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by
explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact
correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present
a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over
batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive
parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

TL;DR: 提出Evidential U-KAN方法，通过渐进式证据不确定性引导注意力机制和语义保持证据学习策略，提升医学图像分割的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有证据深度学习(EDL)方法往往忽略利用富含注意力线索的不确定性图来改进模糊边界分割，且KL正则化会抑制错误类证据，损害不确定性评估。

Method: 提出PEUA机制渐进细化注意力并使用低秩学习去噪注意力权重；引入SAEL策略集成语义平滑证据生成器和保真度增强正则化项；结合U-KAN构建Evidential U-KAN。

Result: 在4个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性和可靠性方面优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: Evidential U-KAN为可信赖医学图像分割提供了新颖解决方案，能有效提升分割性能。

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence
deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and
theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging
uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary
segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty
guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature
representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA
progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank
learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for
challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of
incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization,
impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently
distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a
semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a
semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term
to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the
state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for
trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The

*Yingtie Lei,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出FS-RWKV框架，通过频率空间全向移位和结构保真增强模块，实现从3T到7T MRI图像的高质量合成，解决了现有方法在空间覆盖和计算效率方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然能提供更高的空间分辨率和组织对比度，但由于设备成本和技术要求高，临床应用受限。需要开发从易获取的3T MRI合成7T质量图像的计算方法。

Method: 基于RWKV架构，提出FS-RWKV框架，包含两个关键模块：频率空间全向移位(FSO-Shift)进行离散小波分解和空间移位以增强全局上下文表示；结构保真增强块(SFEB)通过频率感知特征融合自适应强化解剖结构。

Result: 在UNC和BNU数据集上的实验表明，FS-RWKV在T1w和T2w模态上均优于现有的CNN、Transformer、GAN和RWKV基线方法，实现了更优的解剖保真度和感知质量。

Conclusion: FS-RWKV框架有效解决了3T到7T MRI图像合成的挑战，在保持解剖细节和恢复全局组织对比度方面表现出色，为7T MRI的临床应用提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue
contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in
neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners
restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs
and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality
images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this
accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial
coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead.
RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling
in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with
strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose
Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI
translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation
and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)
Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete
wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the
low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while
preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity
Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical
structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on
UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing
CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w
modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM2-3dMed：将SAM2视频分割模型适配到3D医学图像分割，通过切片相对位置预测和边界检测模块解决领域差异，在多个医学数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM2模型直接应用于3D医学图像的两个领域差异：1）切片间的双向解剖连续性vs视频的单向时间流；2）医学图像需要精确边界分割而视频任务对此关注不足。

Method: 提出SAM2-3dMed框架：1）切片相对位置预测模块，通过自监督方式建模切片间双向依赖关系；2）边界检测模块，增强器官和组织边界的分割精度。

Result: 在医学分割十项全能（MSD）数据集的肺、脾脏和胰腺三个数据集上，SAM2-3dMed显著优于现有最先进方法，在分割重叠和边界精度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了3D医学图像分割性能，还为将视频中心的基础模型适配到空间体积数据提供了通用范式。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Conclusion: 利用成人脑先验作为基础，可实现跨生命周期的更可靠和可泛化的脑MRI分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
segmentation across the lifespan.

architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting
the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
