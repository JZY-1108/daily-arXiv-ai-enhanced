### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GRPO和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。在MultiSpider数据集上，该方法显著提升了执行准确率和语义准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，且从英语到其他语言时执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型使用GRPO后执行准确率达到87.4%（比零样本提升26个百分点），语义准确率达到52.29%（提升32.86个百分点）。加入对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明可以通过对比奖励实现定向语义对齐，无需大规模训练数据集即可显著提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，较小的3B模型在仅使用3000个强化学习样本的情况下就能超越更大的8B模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出生成式操作框架，利用大语言模型作为翻译引擎，将XAI技术输出转化为临床可用的叙述性报告，解决心理健康筛查中技术透明度与临床实用性之间的脱节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释人工智能(XAI)技术如SHAP和LIME虽然能产生技术准确的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床应用的持续差距。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用大语言模型作为核心翻译引擎，整合不同XAI工具的技术输出与临床指南，自动生成人类可读、基于证据的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了关键操作障碍，包括工作流程整合、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通，为临床实践提供了集成化、可操作且可信赖的AI解决方案。

Conclusion: 本文为超越孤立数据点生成，向临床实践中提供集成、可操作且可信赖AI的方向提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA是一种公开可验证的水印框架，通过基于词性n-gram的语言自由度动态调整水印强度，在保持文本质量的同时增强检测鲁棒性，且无需访问模型logits。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM水印方法在文本质量与检测鲁棒性之间存在权衡，且依赖模型特定信号（如logits）阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信息的公开可验证水印方法。

Method: STELA利用词性n-gram建模的语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文中减弱水印信号以保持质量，在语言灵活性高的上下文中增强水印信号以提高可检测性。检测器无需访问模型logits。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立性汉语和粘着性韩语等多种语言类型上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度动态调整水印强度，实现了公开可验证的检测，在保持文本质量的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从用户比较模式中收集成对偏好数据的新方法，通过从两个不同模型生成响应来推断用户数据质量，并开发了EM算法来估计用户潜在质量因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，而用户标注虽然能更好地判断自己查询的响应质量，但缺乏质量控制。本文旨在解决用户标注数据的质量问题。

Method: 提出从两个不同模型生成响应，通过不对称性推断用户数据质量，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和为大语言模型对齐进行数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式标注结合质量推断机制能够有效收集高质量的成对偏好数据，为大语言模型对齐提供了新的数据收集途径。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"知情路由"的新范式，通过轻量级特征预测器(LFF)来评估token的重要性和可恢复性，实现了执行或近似策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态token级计算分配方法依赖贪婪路由机制，导致不可逆的信息损失和次优的token选择，限制了LLMs在真实应用中的部署。

Method: 提出轻量级特征预测器(LFF)，在路由决策前预测单元输出，实现执行或近似策略；引入知情路由范式，同时评估token的重要性和可恢复性。

Result: 在语言建模和推理任务上的广泛实验表明，知情路由在多个稀疏度水平上实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡，无需最终LoRA微调即可匹配或超越需要完全微调的基线方法，同时减少50%以上的训练时间。

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地解决信息损失问题，提供了一种灵活高效的计算分配策略，显著提升了LLMs的推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HIES（Head Importance-Entropy Score）剪枝标准，结合头部重要性分数和注意力熵，相比仅使用HIS的方法在模型质量和稳定性上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在NLP任务中表现优异，但其多层多头结构在推理和部署时存在效率问题。现有基于HIS的剪枝方法仅考虑梯度驱动贡献，忽略了注意力模式的多样性。

Method: 提出HIES剪枝标准，将头部重要性分数与注意力熵相结合，提供关于每个头部贡献的互补证据。

Result: 基于HIES的剪枝相比仅使用HIS的方法，模型质量提升15.2%，稳定性提升2.04倍，实现显著模型压缩而不损失精度或稳定性。

Conclusion: HIES方法有效克服了HIS的局限性，通过整合注意力熵信息，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更好的剪枝效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流生成的1,420个问题，以及首个系统性评估对话数据分析工具的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分析任务往往目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清意图，现有基准测试无法捕捉这些复杂性或支持交互性。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从公开数据集文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1,420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了评估工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM能解决更多实例，但在需要持续长时间交互的任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型开发者提供了衡量真正协作模型在复杂交互任务上进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型的不确定性量化方法，提出基于相似性的黑盒框架来评估LLM生成内容的置信度，在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不确定性量化是可信AI系统的关键组件，黑盒方法具有鲁棒性、适应性强、成本低等优势，需要研究如何有效评估LLM何时知道其不知道的内容。

Method: 提出基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，通过生成输出与其他采样生成之间的一致性作为置信度代理，并引入使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的相似性方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒不确定性量化方法能有效评估LLM生成内容的置信度，为可信AI系统提供重要支撑。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种文化感知的仇恨言论检测框架，通过构建个体仇恨子空间来解决训练标签偏见和文化背景差异问题，在各项指标上平均优于现有最佳方法1.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了现实世界中的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的界定存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每种组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于现有最佳方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能够有效解决仇恨言论检测中的文化差异和标签偏见问题，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

### [10] [Meronymic Ontology Extraction via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13839)
*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型从原始评论文本中自动提取产品本体（以部分-整体关系形式）的方法，该方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本体在数字时代对于组织大量非结构化文本至关重要，但手动构建本体耗时耗力且昂贵。特别是在电子商务领域，海量产品列表需要适当的组织方式。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中全自动提取产品本体的方法，提取形式为部分-整体关系。

Result: 通过LLM作为评估器，证明该方法生成的本体优于现有的基于BERT的基线模型。

Conclusion: 本研究为在大语言模型更广泛地应用于（产品或其它）本体提取领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

### [11] [ADMIT: Few-shot Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based Fact Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13842)
*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对RAG事实核查系统的知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下翻转事实核查决策并诱导欺骗性解释，无需访问目标模型即可实现跨检索器和LLM的有效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实核查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为在可信证据占主导的检索环境中，传统攻击方法效果有限。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击技术：少样本、语义对齐的投毒方法，通过多注入技术在不访问目标LLM、检索器或令牌级控制的情况下实现攻击。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT在极低投毒率(0.93×10^-6)下平均攻击成功率达86%，相比现有最优攻击提升11.2%。

Conclusion: ADMIT暴露了现实世界基于RAG的事实核查系统的严重脆弱性，即使在存在强有力反证据的情况下仍能保持攻击效果。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对电子健康记录设计的领域对齐基础模型，通过结构化EHR序列的额外预训练扩展SciBERT，能够编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调电子健康记录的表格化和事件化特性与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，这限制了捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过额外的结构化EHR序列预训练扩展SciBERT，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系，生成更丰富的患者表示。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越和一致的表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医疗基础模型预训练中时序序列化的重要性，SerialBEHRT展示了捕捉临床事件间纵向依赖关系的有效性。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec提出了一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇，解决传统固定短列表方法在词汇表扩展时的延迟瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM词汇表规模扩大，草稿模型的输出头参数成为延迟瓶颈。传统固定子集方法存在语料库依赖性和抑制罕见token的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级元分类器进行上下文路由，选择top-k token簇形成动态短列表，同时利用并行执行实现元短列表计算与草稿编码的同步进行。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，DynaSpec在平均接受长度上获得一致提升，且上下文相关选择允许使用更小的短列表而不降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种鲁棒、加速草稿生成且能跨任务泛化的动态短列表机制，解决了词汇表扩展带来的延迟瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对组合多任务（如翻译摘要）的适配器组合方法，通过添加可学习投影层有效整合摘要和翻译适配器，在保持效率的同时实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数高效微调方法在处理复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时的局限性，标准方法难以同时执行多个复杂任务。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器之上添加可学习投影层，实现有效集成，同时通过减少计算开销保持效率。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在云端和移动设备上均表现良好且速度快，开发的Android应用能无缝执行组合任务。

Conclusion: 该框架在需要高速操作和资源受限的实际应用中具有潜在优势，展示了组合多任务处理的实用可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

### [15] [Language steering in latent space to mitigate unintended code-switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13849)
*Andrey Goncharov,Nikolai Kondusov,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理时方法，通过PCA识别语言方向并引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，有效减少多语言大模型中的意外代码切换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现意外的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 潜在空间语言引导：在平行翻译数据上使用PCA识别语言方向，然后沿这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份。该方法计算开销极小，仅需少量平行数据进行校准。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，跨多个语言对的下一token分布差异减少了高达42%。分析显示语言表示在最终层集中，具有近乎完美的线性可分性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效缓解代码切换问题，同时保持语义完整性，为多语言LLM的语言控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs成功推理时信息密度不均匀，与人类均匀信息密度模式相反，挑战了机器推理的假设


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，因为现有CoT推理步骤常不忠实或难以解释

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行研究

Result: 在三个挑战性数学基准测试中，发现LLMs成功推理是全局非均匀的：正确解决方案以信息密度的不均匀波动为特征

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新颖的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解大语言模型在连续编辑过程中的灾难性干扰问题，实现稳定高效的模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在连续编辑场景中存在显著局限性，新编辑会损害先前集成的更新并降低保留知识，导致灾难性干扰。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐策略，为每个传入编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示，在保留知识上维持输出不变性。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最先进的定位-编辑技术，速度提升高达3.53倍。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在动态演化信息环境中开发更原则性LLM设计方法的必要性，同时提供了一个简单有效且具有强理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准测试，用于衡量大语言模型对不同人物角色的回答事实一致性。研究发现LLM对相同问题会因用户角色不同而给出不一致的事实回答，且一致性程度因模型提供商和话题而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在不同用户角色下的事实回答一致性，提供独立于模型提供商的公正评估标准，确保模型对不同人群提供一致的事实信息。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个话题各请求5个事实，重复100次，每次添加不同人物角色背景。通过句子嵌入计算跨角色余弦相似度，加权平均得到事实一致性分数。

Result: 在100个角色实验中，一致性分数范围0.9065-0.7896，平均0.8656。Grok-3最一致，轻量级模型最差。不同话题一致性不同：就业市场最不一致，G7领导人最一致，疫苗和巴以冲突等话题因提供商而异。

Conclusion: 模型提供商和话题都会影响LLM的事实一致性，需要开发角色不变提示策略来改善一致性表现。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

*Fabian Wenz,Omar Bouattour,Devin Yang,Justin Choi,Cecil Gregg,Nesime Tatbul,Çağatay Demiralp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了BenchPress系统，这是一个人类参与的循环系统，旨在加速创建领域特定的文本到SQL基准测试。该系统利用检索增强生成（RAG）和LLM为给定的SQL查询生成多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家进行选择、排序或编辑以确保准确性和领域对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果较差。手动注释SQL日志以识别对应的自然语言问题是一项艰巨且昂贵的任务，需要数据库管理员的高度专业知识。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）和LLM技术，为给定的SQL查询自动生成多个自然语言描述草案，然后通过人类专家的验证和编辑来确保质量。

Result: 在注释的企业SQL日志上评估显示，LLM辅助注释显著减少了创建高质量基准测试所需的时间和精力。结合人类验证和LLM生成建议提高了注释准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过简化自定义基准测试的创建过程，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估文本到SQL模型在特定领域工作负载上的机制，解决了私有企业环境中基准测试创建的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our
website at http://dsg-mcgraw.csail.mit.edu:5000.

*Mamadou K. Keita,Christopher Homan,Sebastien Diarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Rule-to-Tag（R2T）框架，将语言规则集成到神经网络训练目标中，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练的词性标注模型达到98.2%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言标注数据稀缺问题，探索基于原则而非纯数据驱动的学习范式（PrL），让模型学习任务约束而非仅依赖标注样本。

Method: R2T框架：多层级语言规则集成到神经网络训练目标，包含处理OOV词汇的自适应损失函数和正则化项，支持无监督或弱监督学习。

Result: Zarma词性标注：R2T-BiLSTM仅用无标注文本训练，准确率98.2%，优于在300标注句上微调的AfriBERTa；命名实体识别：R2T预训练+50标注句微调，优于300标注句基线。

Conclusion: R2T框架有效解决低资源NLP任务，证明原则学习范式在数据稀缺场景的潜力，为资源匮乏语言提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一个即插即用的技术，利用模型一致性来提高LLM集成的鲁棒性，通过token级和模型级一致性处理集成中的错误信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同LLM具有不同的优势和弱点，集成方法可以整合它们的互补能力。但现有研究很少关注集成对错误信号的鲁棒性，这些错误信号通常来自异构的分词方案和不同的模型专长。

Method: CoRE通过两个层面的一致性来提升集成鲁棒性：token级一致性使用低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重；模型级一致性通过促进高自信且与其他模型差异小的输出来建模全局一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE作为一种即插即用的技术，可以有效提高LLM集成的鲁棒性，能够无缝集成到各种集成方法中，处理token级和模型级的集成失败问题。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Motivation: 解决医疗视觉问答中生成自由文本响应和结构化伤口属性的挑战，支持临床决策和患者护理。

Method: 采用通用领域指令调优大语言模型，结合检索增强生成框架，从领域数据中检索文本和视觉示例来增强模型输出。

Result: 在19个团队51个提交中排名第3，平均得分41.37%，在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和LLM评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级RAG结合通用LLM为多模态临床NLP任务提供了简单有效的基线方法，无需额外训练或复杂重排序。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Motivation: Transformer模型存在显著内存和计算开销，研究发现架构冗余，为优化提供机会

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝研究，将Transformer块近似为MLP，减少参数和KV缓存需求

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM相比父模型减少25%内存需求和40%训练/推理延迟

Conclusion: 为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了实验和分析见解

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个集成LLM框架用于大规模辅导对话中的情感感知，分析了16,986个对话轮次中学生的情感动态，发现学生通常表现出轻度积极情感和中度唤醒，但学习过程伴随困惑、好奇和偶尔的挫折。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM在教育环境中的情感动态理解不足，需要关注学习者在AI辅导中的情感状态变化，以负责任地整合生成式AI到教育中。

Method: 使用三个前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，包括效价、唤醒度和学习帮助性的标量评分以及自由文本情感标签，通过排名加权模型内池化和跨模型多数共识融合估计。

Result: 学生与AI导师互动时通常报告轻度积极情感和中度唤醒；困惑和好奇是解决问题的常见伴随情绪；挫折较少但可能阻碍进展；情感状态短暂，积极时刻稍长但易受干扰；负面情绪常快速解决，中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 中性时刻为导师干预提供了机会点，情感动态的深入理解有助于设计更有效的AI辅导系统，支持学习者的情感需求。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归语言模型的有前景替代品，但其推理策略仍局限于自回归范式的前缀提示方法，需要专门针对DLMs设计的条件化方法。

Method: Template Infilling (TI)方法：首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充被遮蔽的片段。引入Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA)动态调整片段长度基于生成置信度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了17.01%的稳定提升，并在多标记生成设置中实现了有效加速同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了更灵活的结构控制，显著提升了性能，特别是在多标记生成场景中展现出优势。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，通过sigmoid线性门实现解码器语言模型的token级层跳过，在推理时根据门值对token排序并按预算跳过低重要性token，可节省15%计算同时保持90%以上准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过机制。

Method: 为每个Attention/MLP分支配备sigmoid线性门，在推理时根据门值对token排序，按层预算跳过低重要性token，可在预训练模型上稳定微调。

Result: 在长形式推理任务中节省15%计算同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型中，全计算时获得准确率提升，50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，学习到的门控机制揭示了transformer信息流模式，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 本文引入了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLMs在不确定性下的顺序决策能力。Qwen3-4B模型表现出色，达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，超越了传统算法和其他更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型仅使用自然语言在不确定性下进行顺序决策的能力，目前这一领域尚未充分研究。

Method: 创建纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机环境，让LLMs仅通过"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈来推断潜在奖励结构，并与Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB等传统算法进行比较。

Result: 大多数LLMs表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B模型达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLMs和传统方法。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力能够仅从语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值上下文中的决策能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

*Alexandre Galashov,Matt Jones,Rosemary Ke,Yuan Cao,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"Catch Your Breath"的监督训练方法，让语言模型能够动态调整每个输入token的计算步数，通过输出<don't know>来请求额外计算时间，从而提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型对所有token使用相同计算量，但不同token的预测难度不同。作者希望让模型能够根据token复杂度自主决定计算资源分配，在困难情况下请求更多计算时间。

Method: 提出了三种CYB损失函数：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）。模型通过输出<don't know>请求暂停，获得<pause> token来获得额外计算资源。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能根据token复杂度自适应调整处理时间，例如在复数名词后暂停，在缩略词首token后不暂停。

Conclusion: 动态计算分配能显著提高语言模型的数据效率，模型能够智能地根据token难度和上下文复杂度来请求额外计算资源。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Motivation: 自然语言生成模型在特定任务或要求下表现不佳，需要大量额外数据调整

Method: 使用分类器或提取器等轻量级辅助模块从输入文本中提取信息，构建增强输入来改善生成质量

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一种简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非传统的多项选择或简答格式，以更真实地模拟社会现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM社会模拟研究多采用封闭式设计，限制了LLM的生成多样性，无法真实反映社会意见的复杂性和个体表达。

Method: 基于调查方法学和NLP进展，提出开放式文本生成框架，允许LLM自由表达观点、主题和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改善测量和设计，探索未预料观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

TL;DR: 本研究对10个最先进的大语言模型在IAB 2.2分类体系下的文本分类性能进行了比较评估，发现当前LLMs在文本分类任务中表现中等，存在过度分类问题。通过集成方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际性能，特别是在压缩丰富文本到有限分类体系时的表现，为模型选择和优化提供依据。

Method: 使用统一数据集（8,660个人工标注样本）和相同的零样本提示，对10个LLMs进行对比评估，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标，并开发了集成方法。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%。存在明显的幻觉和膨胀问题。集成方法显著提升准确率，减少膨胀，完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 单纯扩大模型规模和架构改进不能确保更好的分类准确性，而模型协调集成可能是实现超越人类专家性能的最有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面主要关注可验证的最终答案，但自然语言数学证明的生成和验证仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器。

Method: 提出系统化方法开发验证评估器，使用ProofBench数据集（145个问题，435个LLM生成解），探索评估器设计空间，结合强推理骨干模型、参考解和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上达到0.926 MAE，在最佳n选择任务中（n=16）平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader在细粒度数学证明评估方面表现出色，具有推动下游证明生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but

objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择过程中过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的指令数据选择和标注指导方法。

Method: THTB框架结合质量过滤与内在/外在难度评分，优先选择更高认知层次的指令数据，提供可解释和可量化的标准，用于高效的数据选择和标注指导。

Result: 实验表明，THTB使模型仅用5%数据训练就能超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型，展现出强大的领域适应潜力。

Conclusion: THTB为指令数据选择和标注指导提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能，特别是在垂直领域适应方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法捕捉攻击策略的多样性。需要更全面地理解越狱技术的有效性。

Method: 通过结构化红队挑战，开发了包含7个家族的50种越狱策略分类法，收集和分析挑战数据，评估基于分类法的自动检测方法，并编译意大利语多轮对抗对话数据集。

Result: 开发了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击策略的成功率和流行度，验证了分类法引导提示对自动检测的改进效果，创建了包含1364个对话的意大利语数据集。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对越狱技术有效性的深入理解，展示了分类法在改进检测方面的价值，并为研究多轮对抗对话提供了新资源。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的文本质量接近人类水平，作者归属变得越来越困难，需要开发有效的检测方法来区分人类和AI生成的内容。

Method: 使用固定风格嵌入和GPT-4o LLM判断器，在Human AI Parallel Corpus数据集（包含600个平衡实例，涵盖6个领域）上进行评估，每个实例包含人类提示及其对应的黄金延续和LLM生成的延续。

Result: 风格嵌入在GPT延续上表现更好（82% vs 68%），LLM判断器在LLaMA延续上略优（85% vs 81%），但差异不显著。LLM判断器在小说和学术散文领域显著优于风格嵌入，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好。

Conclusion: 作者归属是一个多维问题，需要混合策略。两种方法在不同领域表现出互补优势，LLM判断器具有语义敏感性，而风格嵌入在结构分析方面更强。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型存在明显的激活偏差，这既为改进训练方法提供了思路，也警告AI安全研究者使用此类模型作为更广泛微调研究的代理可能不现实。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务上表现优异，但仍然容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，这些攻击能够绕过模型的安全防护机制。

Method: RAID将离散token松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合优化目标：(i)鼓励受限内容响应，(ii)加入拒绝感知正则化器，使激活远离嵌入空间中的拒绝方向，(iii)应用连贯性术语保持语义合理性和非冗余性。优化后通过批评引导的解码过程将嵌入映射回token。

Result: 在多个开源LLM上的实验表明，RAID比最近的白盒和黑盒基准方法实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时使用更少的查询和更低的计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse

We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

*Nicole Smith-Vaniz,Harper Lyon,Lorraine Steigner,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用道德基础理论分析大型语言模型在政治和道德领域的偏见，比较LLM回应与人类数据，评估其政治倾向和意识形态代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等建议领域，需要了解它们在政治和道德敏感问题上的潜在偏见。

Method: 应用道德基础理论框架，分析LLM在三种情境下的回应：固有回应、明确政治意识形态表达、以及基于人口统计的角色扮演。

Result: 研究发现LLM回应存在政治倾向性，并评估了LLM通过明确提示和角色扮演准确代表意识形态视角的能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI生成回应中的政治和人口统计依赖性，为理解LLM在敏感领域的偏见提供了系统见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL)框架，通过从示例中提取认知构建块来创建抽象模式，增强语言模型在新问题上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学中的图式理论启发，传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏在抽象层面进行知识检索和传递的显式模块，而人类通过激活已有心理框架来理解新信息。

Method: SA-ICL从先前示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的关键推理步骤及其关系的抽象模式，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL在单个高质量演示示例下性能提升高达36.19%，同时减少对演示数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的不同ICL策略，还为增强LLMs中类人推理开辟了新路径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一种无需标签的样本高效提示优化框架，通过成对偏好反馈和双人决斗赌博机设置来优化LLM提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法需要真实标签数据，但高质量标签收集成本高且耗时，需要开发无需标签的优化方法。

Method: PDO将问题建模为决斗赌博机设置，使用Double Thompson Sampling选择信息丰富的提示比较，结合Top-Performer Guided Mutation扩展候选提示池。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了D-TS和提示突变的有效性。

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种无需标签的高效提示优化框架，能够有效利用LLM判断的成对偏好反馈，在标签稀缺场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的内部表示，发现大语言模型在残差流中编码了算术运算符优先级，特别是在MLP块之后，并提出了部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Motivation: 大语言模型在算术任务上表现不佳，现有研究主要关注输出或提示策略，缺乏对模型内部算术计算结构的理解，特别是运算符优先级的编码机制。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术分析LLaMA 3.2-3B模型的残差流，并引入部分嵌入交换技术。

Result: 发现中间计算结果出现在残差流中（特别是在MLP块之后），模型在线性编码中体现了每个运算符在注意力层后的优先级，通过部分嵌入交换可以成功修改运算符优先级。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在内部表示中编码了算术运算符优先级，这为理解模型算术计算机制提供了新视角，部分嵌入交换技术为模型行为干预提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based KGFMs存在LLM知识被稀疏KG上下文遮蔽导致的知识扭曲，以及难以完全约束LLM生成幻觉的问题，限制了推理结果的可信度。

Method: 设计了KRL指令格式和分词器对齐LLM知识与KG表示；提出KRL注意力层通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识和额外KG上下文；提出结构感知的下一个实体预测器严格约束推理结果在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个真实世界归纳KGR数据集上的实验结果表明，KRLM在零样本推理和微调场景中都表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: KRLM通过统一协调LLM知识和KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了归纳知识图谱推理的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot

Result: 实验表明具备更强RAGCap性能的'慢思考'模型在端到端任务中表现更好，验证了基准的有效性

Conclusion: 增强中间推理能力对提升智能RAG系统性能至关重要，RAGCap-Bench为系统评估和能力改进提供了有效工具

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

TL;DR: 该研究将AI辩论应用于主观问题，发现语言模型倾向于迎合法官偏好而非坚持自身信念，顺序辩论存在显著偏见，模型在捍卫自身信念时更具说服力，但违背信念的论据质量反而更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了说谎的主观维度——说谎需要相信所辩护的主张是错误的。本研究旨在探索在主观问题中，语言模型是否会采用迎合策略来最大化说服力。

Method: 测量语言模型的先验信念，然后让辩手在与其信念冲突的法官角色面前辩论，比较顺序和同时两种辩论协议，评估模型在捍卫与自身信念一致或相悖立场时的表现。

Result: 模型倾向于选择与法官角色一致的立场而非自身信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在捍卫与自身信念一致的立场时更具说服力；但违背信念的论据在成对比较中质量评分更高。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理在处理复杂问答任务时面临挑战，因为语言模型未针对长时程推理和探索进行优化。现有方法缺乏对难度和质量的细粒度控制，且难以评估数据本身的有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段数据合成管道，使用基线网络代理逐步增加任务复杂度生成问答对，并在过程中进行事实验证、替代答案检查和过滤。通过从强网络代理蒸馏的受控训练设置来评估合成方法。

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法能生成高质量的训练数据，显著提升网络代理的性能，特别是在长时程推理和工具使用多样性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Method: 构建结构匹配但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较模型在不同文本上的表现

Result: 复杂成人文本训练的模型与简化语言训练的模型表现相当，甚至更快发展出连贯性；统计简单性（n-gram多样性）是更强的学习能力预测指标

Conclusion: 警告不要过度拟人化语言模型训练，应更精确地理解支持小模型能力涌现的实际属性

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 该方法能够有效表示化学元素，支持自然科学研究，为材料科学中AI驱动发现铺平道路。

Conclusion: Element2Vec方法通过语言模型从文本生成元素向量表示，结合测试时训练，为材料科学中的AI驱动发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Motivation: 现有PRM在测试时扩展中表现不稳定，有时甚至被简单的多数投票超越，需要更有效地利用PRM验证信号。

Method: 建立理论框架分析LLM和PRM信号的最优组合策略，提出加权聚合方法，并开发高效的权重函数预计算校准方法。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的实验表明，校准方法显著提升TTS效率，仅用21.3%的计算量就超越了普通加权多数投票的性能。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算是更有效的性能提升路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

Conclusion: FACTS通过可重用的离线模板实现快速摘要，通过可执行的SQL查询确保准确性，通过仅向LLM发送表格模式实现隐私合规，是现实世界查询聚焦表格摘要的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and

TL;DR: BioMedSearch是一个基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，通过整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，结合子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学领域生成的內容缺乏科学严谨性，无法访问权威生物医学数据库，经常虚构蛋白质功能和结构信息。需要开发能够整合多源权威数据的检索框架来支持准确的生物医学查询。

Method: 提出BioMedSearch框架，整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤等技术处理复杂生物医学查询。

Result: 在包含3000个问题的BioMedMCQs数据集上测试，BioMedSearch在所有三个推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升到91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升到81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch通过多源信息检索和任务分解策略，有效解决了LLMs在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出并验证了LLM脑退化假说：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力持续下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，并增加"黑暗特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM认知能力的因果影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型认知能力退化，为持续预训练的数据筛选提供安全指导。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量），在匹配的token规模和训练条件下对4个LLM进行持续预训练实验。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致推理能力显著下降（Hedges' g>0.3），ARC-Challenge从74.9降至57.2，RULER-CWE从84.4降至52.3。发现思维跳跃是主要病变，指令调优和干净数据预训练只能部分恢复能力。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力退化的因果驱动因素，应将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并为部署的LLM建立常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

*Siying Liu,Shisheng Zhang,Indu Bala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在药物安全预测中存在系统性偏见，会根据社会经济属性（如教育、住房稳定性等）产生不同的不良反应预测结果，弱势群体被预测有更高的不良反应风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在药物安全预测中是否纳入临床无关的社会人口统计学信息，评估模型公平性风险。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据，基于人物角色评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会经济属性人物角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测可能性，并识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种偏见模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重公平性风险，临床部署前需要建立公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 通过指令检索而非生成的方式，为小语言模型提供结构化推理指导，在医学、法律和数学问答任务上显著提升性能，无需额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在本地硬件上运行具有隐私、成本和环保优势，但在多步推理和领域知识任务上表现不佳，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 构建指令语料库，将相似训练问题分组并用GPT-5生成指令。推理时检索最相关指令并遵循其步骤，提供结构化推理指导。

Result: 在3B到14B参数模型上，MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。简洁指令优于长指令，改进程度取决于模型家族和内在推理能力。

Conclusion: 指令检索为小语言模型提供了有效的推理增强方法，在多个领域任务上实现显著性能提升，且简洁指令效果更好。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Conclusion: 该研究为深度研究代理在金融分析领域的评估提供了系统框架和基准，基准和评估代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过作者特定微调，AI生成的文本在风格保真度和写作质量上优于专业人类写作，这对版权法的合理使用条款具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学文本并模仿作者风格，以回应关于AI使用受版权保护书籍训练模型的法律争议。

Method: 进行预注册研究，比较MFA训练的专业作家与ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini三种前沿AI模型，在模仿50位获奖作家风格方面。使用盲法成对评估，由159名专家和普通读者参与。

Result: 上下文提示生成的AI文本被专家强烈排斥，但经过作者特定微调后，专家反而偏好AI生成的文本。微调输出很少被AI检测器识别（3% vs 97%）。

Conclusion: 作者特定微调使AI能够生成读者偏好的非逐字写作，为版权法的第四合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: MTI是一个无需训练的高效推理框架，通过仅在不确定位置应用选择性CFG干预和轻量级负提示引导，显著提升LLM的推理准确性和稳定性，同时保持高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在测试时通过增加推理计算来提升推理能力，但效率低下。研究发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少量高熵token显著影响输出正确性。

Method: 1) 选择性CFG干预：仅在不确定位置应用分类器无引导；2) 轻量级负提示引导：重用主模型的KV缓存来高效近似无条件解码。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升：Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准测试上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MTI证明了通过针对性地干预局部不确定性token，可以在不牺牲效率的情况下显著提升LLM的推理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Method: 开发了RAG错误类型的新分类法，创建了带错误类型标注的数据集，并提出了与分类法对齐的自动评估方法。

Result: 提出了完整的错误分类体系，提供了错误示例和解决建议，开发了可用于实践开发的自动评估工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统的错误分析和改进提供了系统性的框架和实用工具，有助于提升RAG系统的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 大规模语言模型开发依赖大规模训练语料，但大多数语料许可状态不明确，限制了真正开放模型的发展。对于非英语语言，特别是德语，开放许可文本仍然严重稀缺。

Method: 从41个来源的7个领域（法律、科学、文化、政治、新闻、经济和网络文本）系统收集数据，实施全面的质量过滤、去重和文本格式修复处理流程。

Result: 构建了包含154.56亿token的高质量德语文本语料库，所有领域子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或同等许可，确保模型训练和重新分发的法律合规性。

Conclusion: 德国Commons解决了德语开放预训练数据的关键缺口，支持真正开放的德语语言模型开发，同时发布了语料构建和数据过滤代码，使项目完全可复现和可扩展。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，通过四个可解释指标（文化流畅性、偏差、一致性和语言适应性）来评估LLM在跨文化语境中的推理能力，而不仅仅是答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估仅关注答案准确性，无法反映模型对文化背景的真实理解。需要开发能评估跨文化推理能力的框架。

Method: 使用来自世界价值观调查的50个文化基础问题，翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek和FANAR）的2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 发现显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语保持稳定。GPT跨语言适应更好但一致性较低，FANAR推理稳定但僵化。

Conclusion: LLM的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架显现。CRaFT为评估多语言环境中的跨文化推理提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抽象推理任务中存在语言偏见，英语模态优势明显，模型类型影响推理性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Motivation: 语言虽然通常被认为是任意的，但在许多具体案例中观察到语音和语义之间的系统关系。本研究旨在通过大规模定量调查探索这些系统关系的程度，包括先前已识别和未识别的现象。

Method: 采用分布方法，在6种不同语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中分析语素的语音相似性空间和语义相似性空间的对齐情况，使用一套统计测量方法。

Result: 发现了一系列文献中未识别过的可解释的音义对齐关系，以及跨语言模式。对5种先前假设的音义对齐关系的分析显示，部分得到支持，部分结果混合。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases

Motivation: 现有超出范围意图检测方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块，需要更紧凑、稳健的端到端解决方案。

Method: 结合通用句子编码器和领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器，使用融合表示和轻量级分支分类器，集成合成和开放域异常增强。

Result: 仅使用150万可训练参数，在多个意图基准测试中持续优于最新基线，已知意图宏F1提升6-15%，超出范围意图提升8-20%，在低资源设置中收益最显著。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供稳健、可扩展和可靠的超出范围检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B

TL;DR: 提出RLSR方法替代SFT，利用强化学习框架提升基础模型的指令遵循能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于传统SFT方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望利用丰富的SFT数据集在强化学习框架中提升模型性能，改善基础模型的指令遵循能力

Method: RLSR方法：基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，通过语义嵌入空间中的余弦相似度计算生成响应与人工标注响应之间的奖励分数

Result: RLSR直接替代SFT时，在AlpacaEval上获得26.34%胜率，优于SFT的21.01%；SFT+RLSR组合达到30.73%胜率

Conclusion: RLSR可有效替代或与SFT结合使用，显著提升模型在下游任务中的指令遵循性能

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的角色配置文件（如精选信息和个性特征）而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并相应优化角色配置文件。

Result: 在四种不同行为预测场景（正式辩论、社交媒体心理健康帖子、公开访谈、电影评论）上测试五种大语言模型，DPRF相比基线角色配置显著提升了行为对齐度，且在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和增强下游应用（如用户模拟、社会研究和个性化AI）的有效性提供了稳健的方法论。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳跃框架，通过阶段化离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出来平衡效率与准确性，实现1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然提升了小语言模型的推理能力，但增加了延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳跃）难以平衡效率与准确性，面临阶段间跳跃敏感性差异和冗余输出令牌生成两大挑战。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段化离线搜索分配最优层预算，以及基于置信度的在线生成早期退出机制来抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试中，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳跃方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率-准确性平衡问题，为小语言模型的多阶段推理提供了高效的加速方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失，提升LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对同一提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的答案，需要提高模型对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵(CCE)使用多数投票创建硬伪标签，表示对齐损失将低置信度和非多数预测器拉向共识。

Result: 在11个数据集上评估，平均提高观察一致性11.62%，提升平均F1分数8.94%，减少格式间性能方差3.29%。在域外评估中也有效泛化。

Conclusion: F²C是增强LLM一致性、性能和泛化能力的有效无监督方法，特别适用于提示扰动场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: 提出了MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转变为主动理解，模拟人类阅读认知过程，通过多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆，并融入反向推理策略训练小语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式仅理解相关文本块，限制了知识内化和推理能力，需要从被动分块转向主动理解，模拟人类阅读认知过程。

Method: MoM框架：1）用LLM生成文档逻辑大纲指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；2）多路径采样和多视角评估机制选择最优文档记忆；3）融入反向推理策略训练SLMs；4）三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，并使SLMs实现以人为中心的智能文本处理。

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅解决了RAG系统的文本分块挑战，还为SLMs实现人类中心智能文本处理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立训练数据与语言模型行为之间的因果关系，需要超越传统的观察性分析，开发能够主动干预和测试假设的实验方法。

Method: 通过选择评估项目、匹配相关文档、修改文档内容、重新训练模型并测量效果等步骤，实现对训练数据历史的"重写"干预。

Result: 案例研究表明，共现统计和信息检索方法在识别知识学习相关文档方面存在局限性，无法完全解释模型正确回答知识问题的能力。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验框架，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的各种假设，并公开代码促进未来研究。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Conclusion: DEG-RAG框架有效解决了LLM生成知识图谱的噪声问题，是首个对LLM生成知识图谱中实体解析进行全面探索的工作。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Method: 分析影响多语言嵌入效果的关键因素：训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性，并基于这些发现开发紧凑模型。

Result: 发现训练数据规模增加带来的性能提升会快速饱和，硬负样本对提升检索准确性至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。

Conclusion: 成功开发出300M参数的紧凑多语言模型，在检索任务上达到或超过7B大模型的性能，证明小模型通过专门优化可以在特定任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全护栏模型存在两个主要问题：1) 只能输出二元安全标签，无法适应不同领域的安全容忍度差异；2) 需要完整模型输出才能进行安全检查，无法与流式LLM推理兼容。

Method: 提出两种专门变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转为指令跟随任务，支持三分类（安全、争议、不安全）；流式Qwen3Guard引入token级分类头，实现增量文本生成的实时安全监控。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面达到最先进性能。模型支持119种语言，提供三种参数规模（0.6B、4B、8B）。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核，所有模型在Apache 2.0许可下公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要检索多个证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率之间存在权衡，需要更智能的检索系统来同时优化这两个指标。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器精确检索相关上下文，加法器补充缺失证据，通过选择器和加法器的迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的支持段落集。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue和MultiHopRAG四个多跳问答基准测试中，该方法始终优于强基线模型，实现了更高的检索准确率。

Conclusion: 该代理检索系统能够有效过滤干扰内容，使下游问答模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确率，为多跳问答提供了高效的检索解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但未被充分探索的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向检索策略：表优先检索后列选择，和列优先检索后表选择，并结合问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider基准测试中显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能超越全模式基线并接近oracle性能，将完整模式和完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，无需查询优化即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版物快速增长导致科学家难以及时跟踪最新研究成果，现有论文数据库仅限于相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关系网络。

Method: 基于OpenAlex开源知识图谱，分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行关键概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的智能体。

Result: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，通过对Qwen和DeepSeek模型的微调，在准确性方面取得了显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决学术论文分析中的关键概念关系挖掘问题，为科学家提供更深入的学术洞察。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

Motivation: 现有数学推理基准主要关注英语或高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理能力的评估。

Method: 构建平行多语言数据集，系统评估开源和专有LLM在零样本、思维链和代码切换推理范式下的表现。

Result: LLM在不同语言中的数学推理能力存在显著差异，在低资源语言环境中表现明显下降。

Conclusion: LLM在跨语言数学推理方面存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境中，需要改进多语言推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并提出多轮强化学习方法将欺骗行为减少77.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在与用户交互时可能产生欺骗性输出，无论是故意还是无意的，这带来了严重的安全隐患。模型行为的不可预测性、对幻觉和错误信息的防护不足，使其误用成为现实风险。

Method: 提出信念错位指标量化欺骗，在四种对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五个现有欺骗检测指标和新指标。引入多轮强化学习方法微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新欺骗指标与人类判断相关性更高；LLMs在约26%对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为；被提示欺骗时欺骗性可增加31%；RLHF模型平均欺骗率达43%；多轮强化学习方法将欺骗减少77.6%。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，需要超越单轮分析进行有效评估和缓解。提出的多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种基于混合词嵌入和超参数优化的阿尔茨海默病早期检测方法，通过结合Doc2Vec和ELMo词向量，加入语言特征，使用逻辑回归模型，实现了91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的早期检测对患者有益，能够及早治疗减轻症状并降低医疗负担。语言能力变化是AD的重要标志，可用于早期诊断。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，加入语言特征分析句法和语义，将嵌入特征向量输入逻辑回归模型并精细调优超参数。

Result: 实现了91%的分类准确率和97%的AUC值，优于现有最佳NLP模型的88%准确率。模型稳定性良好（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确且稳定，可作为AD的大规模筛查方法，也可作为医生检测AD的补充检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Beyond One World基准，用于评估LLM在多版本角色扮演中的表现，重点关注角色忠实度和推理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在扮演多版本角色（如漫威和DC超级英雄的不同版本）时的忠实度和一致性，目前这方面研究不足。

Method: 构建包含30个英雄和90个特定版本的基准，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景），并提出了Think-Act Matching指标来量化推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能提升弱模型的叙事连贯性但可能降低强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常在思考或行动中表现良好，但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World基准揭示了LLM在多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高性能医学大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。本研究旨在通过模型协作而非微调来提升医学AI系统的性能。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型的确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。使用Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct、Phi-4 14B和Gemma 2 12B模型。

Result: 在三个医学基准测试中表现优异，PubMedQA达到95.0%，MedMCQA达到78.0%。消融研究证实置信度感知路由结合多模型协作显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型协作为改进医学AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对在资源受限环境中普及先进医学AI具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Result: 尽管存在强混淆效果，许多LLMs仍保持显著性能，表明其对字符级噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs的低级鲁棒性研究揭示了其滥用风险以及在多样化应用中部署的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national

Motivation: 现有问答系统在单跳和多跳问题上取得进展，但对于需要聚合所有文档信息的现实问题（如医疗记录、合规文件），现有方法表现不佳，因为这类问题对召回率敏感且需要穷尽检索。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG架构，采用"逐个检查所有文档，廉价过滤"策略：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤器在昂贵的LLM推理前丢弃不相关文档。

Result: 在PluriHopWIND数据集上测试，传统RAG方法F1分数不超过40%，而PluriHopRAG实现了18-52%的相对F1分数提升。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集暴露了当前问答系统在重复性高、干扰文档多的语料上的局限性，PluriHopRAG的性能证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤相比top-k方法的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Result: 统计分析和LLM实验结果表明，整合评论树数据能显著提高用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性和早期自杀干预策略提供了新的视角和宝贵基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用下一个词预测方面表现出色，但难以生成反映个体真实沟通风格的回复，如以个人风格回复邮件或社交消息。由于隐私问题，真实的社交网络或邮件历史难以收集。

Method: 构建了包含英语、日语和中文的100个对话会话的多语言基准，用户与基于MBTI维度的心理基础NPC进行五天互动，捕捉自然的日常生活沟通模式。

Result: 建立了YNTP的首个基准，评估了基于提示和微调的个性化方法，为面向用户的语言建模奠定了基础。

Conclusion: YNTP任务通过受控对话有效建模用户用词风格，为开发更符合个人沟通习惯的语言模型提供了数据基础和方法评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization

Method: 1) 引用感知推理：要求所有生成内容必须基于检索的医学文档；2) 迭代检索验证：通过验证代理评估证据充分性并优化查询；3) MedTrust对齐模块：结合验证正例和幻觉感知负例，强化引用基础推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct平均准确率提升2.7%，Qwen3-8B提升2.4%。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统化的证据验证和对齐训练，显著提升了生物医学问答的事实一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在处理多约束指令时表现不佳，现有强化学习方法依赖外部监督且面临稀疏奖励问题。

Method: 采用标签自监督RL框架，通过约束分解策略和高效的逐约束二元分类来生成伪标签训练奖励模型。

Result: 在3个领域内和5个领域外数据集上均取得显著改进，包括具有挑战性的代理和多轮指令跟随任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决多约束指令跟随问题，具有良好的泛化能力，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Explore to Evolve范式来构建可验证的网页代理训练数据，开发了WebAggregatorQA数据集和WebAggregator模型系列，在信息聚合能力上超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源深度研究代理主要关注信息检索能力，忽视了信息聚合这一支持深度研究的关键需求。

Method: 采用Explore to Evolve范式：先通过主动在线探索收集真实网页证据，然后自演进地从12种高级逻辑类型中选择、组合和优化操作来合成可验证的QA对。

Result: 构建了包含10K样本、覆盖50K网站和11个领域的WebAggregatorQA数据集。WebAggregator-8B性能匹配GPT-4.1，32B版本在GAIA-text上超越GPT-4.1超过10%，接近Claude-3.7-sonnet。

Conclusion: 网页代理在信息聚合能力上仍有不足，需要加强基础模型的信息聚合能力，特别是在检索到所有参考资料后仍难以处理复杂聚合任务。

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的编程式JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成，显著提升工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统编程式JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成解耦，消除任务干扰和格式限制

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提升18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著改善工具调用性能，在强化学习和监督微调阶段都有训练意义，且能扩展缺乏原生支持的模型能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定表示组合架构和语言耦合语义推理器，在低资源语言条件下提升跨语言表示能力，同时增强检索和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言上性能接近饱和，但在低资源语言上表现较差，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和跨语言对齐不稳定。

Method: LiRA包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca的多语言表示基础上添加语言感知轻量级推理头，通过一致性正则化统一训练目标。

Result: 在低资源基准测试（跨语言检索、语义相似度和推理）中，在少样本和噪声放大设置下均显示出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并通过消融实验验证了Arca和LaSR的贡献。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重组实体级标记来提高seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率，在保持性能的同时实现1.8的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法有效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重组实体级标记，并丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低0.6个CoNLL F1点，同时实现1.8的压缩比；在LitBank上超过最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大部分标记是增量共指消解的一种可行策略，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着主权LLMs的发展，缺乏验证这些模型是否与用户社会文化背景对齐、是否保持安全性和技术鲁棒性的框架和数据集。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥有意义的作用，但未必能很好地服务目标用户，且追求未经测试的主张可能导致低估安全等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 当前偏好学习方法在客观质量信号被移除时性能显著下降。作者提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现基于序列的奖励模型准确率仅为52.7%，而生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链达到81.8%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当客观质量信号被移除时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在主观质量偏好（如创造力、风格特色）上的真实能力。

Method: 构建WritingPreferenceBench数据集（1,800个人工标注的偏好对），在8种创意写作类型中匹配客观正确性、事实准确性和长度，比较序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型平均准确率52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，生成式奖励模型81.8%。模型在不同写作类型间方差很大（18.2%-81.8%），27B参数模型相比8B模型没有显著改进。

Conclusion: 当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好，成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过合成数据和强化学习的结合，有效提升了LLMs在归纳推理任务上的表现，同时保持了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音合成在情感表达方面仍面临挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或优化间接目标，导致生成的语音准确但情感平淡。

Method: 采用基于AI反馈的强化学习机制，结合自动语音识别和大型语言模型技术，通过韵律标签对齐和语义准确性反馈来优化情感表达和清晰度。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，相比Chat-TTS，WER降低26.1%，SIM-O提升9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效提升了语音合成的情感表达能力和自然度，为情感语音合成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量的问题。

Method: 让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上进行多标签分类，基于相同聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准测试集上，性能达到或优于现有基线方法，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM的奖励建模存在局限性：基于规则的奖励（如精确匹配）对表达变化脆弱且不适用于长文本任务；生成奖励虽然提高了鲁棒性，但在动态语料库中设计可验证且稳定的长文本奖励仍然具有挑战性且计算成本高。

Conclusion: 提出的“nugget-as-rubric”范式和Search-Gen-V验证器有效解决了搜索增强LLM奖励建模的挑战，在动态语料库中实现了可验证、鲁棒且高效的评估。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过微调机器翻译模型来学习语义韵律的方法，重点关注中文"被"字句的负面语义韵律，并证明该方法能提高翻译准确性且知识可跨语言迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是语言单位与特定搭配形成的意义，与字面意义不同。当前机器翻译模型无法处理语义韵律问题，导致翻译不准确。

Method: 创建包含中文"被"字句负面语义韵律的英汉平行语料库，然后微调OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行英汉翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的机器翻译模型在翻译负面内容时更倾向于使用"被"字句，而对中性和正面内容则避免使用。NLLB-600M模型还能将语义韵律知识迁移到其他语言对（如西班牙语-中文）。

Conclusion: 通过专门设计的训练数据微调机器翻译模型，可以有效教授语义韵律知识，提高翻译准确性，且这种知识具有跨语言迁移能力。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

Conclusion: 故事叙述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和利益，更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

*Mengzhao Jia,Zhihan Zhang,Ignacio Cases,Zheyuan Liu,Meng Jiang,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRubric-R1V框架通过自动收集基于评分标准的生成奖励，将强化学习与过程级监督相结合，解决了多模态大语言模型中仅奖励最终答案正确性导致的虚假推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但基于可验证奖励的强化学习往往导致虚假推理，因为只奖励最终答案的正确性。

Method: 提出AutoRubric-R1V框架，通过可扩展的自聚合方法从成功轨迹中提炼一致推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，联合利用基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门评估中显著提高推理忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过过程级监督有效解决了多模态推理中的虚假推理问题，实现了更好的推理性能和忠实度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个用于评估LLM生成Verilog代码效率的基准测试框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM在功能正确性上表现良好(78.3%)，但在面积、延迟和功耗效率方面(63-66%)仍落后于专家实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功耗等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成代码的效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个问题的全面评估集，配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于系统评估LLM生成的Verilog设计效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%(pass@1)，但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功耗效率64.0%(eff@1)，明显落后于专家实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究进展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本。研究发现创意写作需要过程监督和通用数据的平衡，创意能力具有文化界限性，词汇多样性与创意质量呈负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在创意写作中的系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境下训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的问题。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本，构建包含逆向工程提示、创作推理过程和最终文本的三元组数据集，并进行全面实验验证。

Result: 发现过程监督有效但需要通用数据稳定（至少1:12比例），创意能力无跨语言迁移（中英文性能差距89.26%），词汇多样性与创意质量负相关（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑支架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和最终答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要一种不依赖特定提取规则的方法来提高评估可靠性。

Method: 使用额外模型推理，将先前的输入输出加上"Answer:"前缀重新生成答案，然后从重新生成的输出中选择或提取最终答案。

Result: 该方法在数学问题和开放式问答任务中表现出改进的性能和增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Answer Regeneration框架为模型评估提供了更可靠的结果，减少了对特定答案提取规则的依赖。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序中的效果，发现SFT由于提供更强的权重方案而优于CL，并在MRB基准测试中取得了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的研究动机。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，通过统一框架分析CL和SFT的交互作用，并进行探测实验比较两者的效果。

Result: 研究发现SFT提供比CL更强的权重方案，而评分方向没有明显优势，总体上SFT在LLM重排序中优于CL，并在MRB基准上取得了新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中比CL更具优势，主要原因是其提供更强的权重机制，这一发现对未来的研究和应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署时由于分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，限制了在MoE架构中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段循环：预填充阶段和定期优化阶段，使用自监督基于已生成序列优化路由决策，通过轻量级加法向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上获得一致性能提升，例如在OLMoE上HumanEval提升5.5%，与自一致性结合时在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部数据或监督，保持计算效率，防止过适应，并能与现有测试时缩放技术自然互补。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练能获得更好的领域内性能并减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练在实践中很流行，但对其有效性的科学理解仍然不足，需要系统研究这一训练阶段的工作原理和效果。

Method: 通过从头开始预训练语言模型并在不同领域的有监督微调数据集上进行控制实验，研究中期训练的效果。

Result: 在数学和代码领域，中期训练能显著提升领域内验证损失表现，并减少预训练数据的遗忘。时机选择比混合权重更重要，较早引入专业数据能带来更大收益。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的效率，需要提供显式机制来协调计算和数据以充分利用这些架构。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和分层操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；在多头注意力中仅用约150行代码实现融合实现。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为有效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理调度实现高效执行。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: LLM在处理语义等价输入时经常产生不一致的输出，现有训练数据缺乏一致性关注，且微调技术在提升输出一致性方面存在局限。

Method: 结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的层模型合并方法，利用一致性感知权重整合专业知识。

Result: 合并后的模型显著提升了输出一致性，相比基线实现了约47.5%的响应相似度提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业级RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Conclusion: LaSeR算法通过最后一词自奖励机制，以最小额外成本有效统一了模型的推理和自验证能力，显著提升了效率

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

TL;DR: MetaBench是首个代谢组学评估基准，用于系统评估LLM在代谢组学领域的表现，发现模型在文本生成任务上表现良好，但在跨数据库标识符关联和稀疏标注的长尾代谢物任务上存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在通用文本上表现出色，但在需要深度、互连知识的专业科学领域（如代谢组学）的能力尚未充分表征。代谢组学因其复杂的生化途径、异构标识符系统和碎片化数据库而带来独特挑战。

Method: 从权威公共资源中整理MetaBench基准，评估代谢组学研究的五个关键能力：知识、理解、基础、推理和研究。评估了25个开源和闭源LLM。

Result: 评估显示模型在文本生成任务上表现良好，但即使使用检索增强，跨数据库标识符关联仍然具有挑战性。模型在标注稀疏的长尾代谢物上性能下降。

Conclusion: MetaBench为开发和评估代谢组学AI系统提供了必要的基础设施，有助于系统性地推进代谢组学研究的可靠计算工具发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态生成模型在处理方言文本输入时的性能问题，发现现有模型在方言输入下性能下降32.26%-48.17%，并提出了一种新的编码器缓解策略来同时提升方言性能并保持标准英语性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型能否有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有模型主要针对标准英语训练。

Method: 构建了包含6种常见英语方言的大规模基准数据集，收集了4200多个经过验证的提示，评估了17个图像和视频生成模型，并设计了一种基于编码器的缓解策略来教模型识别新方言特征。

Result: 当前最先进的多模态生成模型在方言输入下性能下降32.26%-48.17%，传统缓解方法只能小幅提升方言性能(<7%)且会降低标准英语性能。作者的方法能将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当(+34.4%)，同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能下降问题，作者提出的编码器缓解策略能够有效解决这一问题，在提升方言性能的同时保持标准英语性能，为多语言和多方言生成模型的发展提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

TL;DR: 提出IGPO框架，通过信息增益为多轮交互的LLM智能体提供密集内在奖励，解决传统结果奖励的稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM智能体训练依赖最终答案的结果奖励，在多轮交互中面临奖励稀疏、优势崩溃和信用分配困难等问题。

Method: IGPO将每轮交互建模为获取地面真相信息的增量过程，定义轮级奖励为策略产生正确答案概率的边际增长，结合结果监督形成密集奖励轨迹。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，IGPO在多轮场景下始终优于强基线，实现了更高的准确性和改进的样本效率。

Conclusion: IGPO通过内在信念更新提供密集监督，有效解决了多轮智能体训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升了性能和学习效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator是一个可扩展的范式，通过生成结构化UI状态和转换来大规模合成训练轨迹，解决了数字代理需要多样化大规模UI轨迹但收集成本过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字代理需要多样化的大规模UI轨迹来泛化真实世界任务，但收集此类数据在人工标注、基础设施和工程方面成本过高。

Method: 集成数字世界模拟器生成多样化UI状态，引导式展开过程实现连贯探索，轨迹包装器生成高质量多样化训练轨迹。还提出UI-Simulator-Grow目标缩放策略，优先处理高影响力任务并合成信息丰富的轨迹变体。

Result: 在WebArena和AndroidWorld上的实验表明，UI-Simulator与在真实UI上训练的开源代理相当或更优，具有更好的鲁棒性。UI-Simulator-Grow仅使用Llama-3-8B-Instruct就达到了Llama-3-70B-Instruct的性能。

Conclusion: 目标合成缩放范式具有持续高效增强数字代理的潜力，为解决UI轨迹数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TokDrift框架，用于衡量代码LLMs中语义相同但token化不同的代码变体对模型行为的影响，发现即使是微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码LLMs使用基于统计而非语法的子词分词器，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因空格或标识符命名等表面因素而被不同地token化，影响模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则创建仅在token化上不同的代码变体，并在九个代码LLMs上进行测试，包括参数超过30B的大型模型。

Result: 即使是微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为发生显著变化，层间分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕捉语法token边界。

Conclusion: 错位的token化是代码理解和生成可靠性的隐藏障碍，未来的代码LLMs需要语法感知的tokenization。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应刷新KV缓存来减少扩散大语言模型解码时的冗余计算，显著提升解码速度同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远距离MASK令牌可作为长度偏置进行块状缓存；(2) KV动态随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新足够；(3) 最受关注令牌的KV漂移最小。提出Elastic-Cache，通过注意力感知漂移测试决定何时刷新，通过深度感知调度决定从哪层开始刷新。

Result: 在GSM8K（256 tokens）上实现8.7倍加速，长序列上45.1倍加速，HumanEval上4.8倍加速，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。在GSM8K上吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过训练无关、架构无关的自适应缓存策略，显著加速扩散LLM解码，同时保持生成质量，使扩散LLM的实际部署成为可能。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大规模标注数据且泛化能力有限，需要开发无需标注的零样本食物识别方法。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕获细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat在识别准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的无监督和少样本方法。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够实现灵活、类人的复杂食物场景理解。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

Motivation: 传统视觉模型需要大量领域特定标注数据且理解复杂环境上下文能力有限，而视觉语言模型在遥感领域应用不足。

Method: 集成YOLO与多种VLMs（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini），在标注和未标注遥感数据以及退化图像场景下进行评估。

Result: 飞机检测和计数的平均MAE提升48.46%，CLIPScore提升6.17%，在挑战性条件和退化场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与VLMs的结合为遥感图像分析提供了更先进高效的解决方案，特别适用于少样本学习场景。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间变异性的问题，需要提高检测的准确性和一致性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习构建深度学习模型，在640个前列腺核心针活检样本上训练，并在内部和外部队列中进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC为0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；在外部验证中AUC为0.90，Cohen's kappa为0.55；在评分者间分析中平均Cohen's kappa为0.66，优于所有病理学家。

Conclusion: AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到病理学家水平，有望提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲）效果不佳，而这些扰动在现实世界中很常见。

Method: 首先建立对抗图像的生成过程，然后通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架能够有效处理非加性对抗扰动，弥补了现有方法在此类扰动上的不足。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图结构的检索-推理增强生成框架，用于提升大视频语言模型在长视频理解中的表现，通过结构化图表示和中间推理步骤解决长视频处理中的时序依赖和无关信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理超出上下文窗口的密集视频token和保留长期时序信息的挑战，现有检索增强生成方法在长视频中面临时序依赖破坏和无关信息干扰的问题。

Method: 提出Vgent框架：1) 使用结构化图表示视频片段间的语义关系以改进检索效果；2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，促进跨片段相关信息的显式聚合。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，Vgent相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，相比最先进的视频RAG方法性能提升8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent通过图结构表示和中间推理机制有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，显著提升了LVLMs在长视频任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同场景或生成AI视频中由于主题、背景多样性和非线性时间错位带来的复杂同步挑战。

Method: 使用预训练模型提取高维嵌入，构建紧凑的1D原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段，实现鲁棒对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，包括细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务。

Conclusion: TPL是首个解决多个生成AI视频同步问题的方法，在多样化视频同步任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Motivation: 现有方法存在单视角几何不一致和幻觉问题，影响身份保持；基于合成数据训练的模型无法捕捉皮肤皱纹和细发等高频细节，限制了真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1)生成式规范化模块处理多视角图像为标准化表示；(2)基于transformer的模型，使用从真实人物圆顶捕捉数据构建的高斯泼溅头像数据集训练。采用"捕捉-规范化-泼溅"流程。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源的Python库，通过为SciPy和scikit-image API提供GPU加速的替代方案，解决了生物图像分析中的可扩展性和效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集使得现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率和与现代科学计算工作流的集成方面受到限制。现有工具缺乏API支持、GPU加速、3D图像处理能力和计算密集型工作流的互操作性。

Method: cubic通过增强广泛使用的SciPy和scikit-image API，使用CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM提供GPU加速替代方案。其API是设备无关的，当数据在设备上时自动调度GPU操作，否则在CPU上执行。

Result: 通过基准测试单个操作和复制现有的去卷积和分割流程，实现了显著的速度提升，同时保持了算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大五人格，但缺乏对HEXACO人格（特别是诚实-谦逊特质）的研究，且两种人格在机器学习建模中的关系尚未明确。

Method: 通过联合优化识别大五人格和HEXACO人格的方法，利用多模态人类行为数据进行建模。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效识别大五人格和HEXACO人格。

Conclusion: 联合建模大五人格和HEXACO人格可以提高多模态人类行为的认知能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面噪声分析的AI生成图像检测方法，通过位平面引导的噪声图像生成和多方向梯度计算，在GenImage基准上达到98.9%的平均准确率，比现有方法快近百倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法有效捕捉原始图像中的内在噪声特征。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理精炼误差提取，设计最大梯度补丁选择来放大噪声信号，提出轻量级分类头结构（噪声分类器和噪声引导分类器）。

Result: 在GenImage基准上平均准确率达98.9%（提升11.9%），跨生成器泛化能力强（GAN到Diffusion 98.2%，Diffusion到GAN 99.2%），毫秒级误差提取速度。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确率、速度和泛化能力方面均优于现有方法，为AI生成图像检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基本帧级一致性检查或单模态检测策略，无法有效识别由GAN、扩散模型和神经渲染技术生成的现代深度伪造内容，这些先进技术会产生被传统检测器忽略的细微时间差异。

Method: PIA框架整合了音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入，通过多模态分析识别跨多个互补模态的不一致性来检测深度伪造。

Result: 该集成方法显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态音频-视觉分析有效解决了现代深度伪造检测的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的OCC系统存在比特率低和处理负载高的问题，而现有的基于事件的OCC系统使用的传统调制方案未能充分利用事件视觉传感器的独特特性。

Method: 提出了事件间隔调制（EIM）方案，通过调制事件之间的间隔来编码信息；调整和定制EVS参数以优化EIM的频率响应；实验确定EIM可用的最大调制阶数；基于获得的参数进行传输实验。

Result: 成功在室内环境中实现了28 kbps（10米距离）和8.4 kbps（50米距离）的传输速率，为基于事件的OCC系统设定了新的比特率基准。

Conclusion: EIM调制方案能够充分利用事件视觉传感器的异步操作和高动态范围特性，显著提升了基于事件的OCC系统的传输性能。

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统SCR方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单网络容量

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略(ALF-LB)提升定位精度

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低成本同时保持更高精度

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了高精度

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，尤其是当人物表情变化大、动作幅度大或人脸在图像中占比小时，人类对身份变化敏感，这成为I2V生成的关键挑战。

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号加速收敛，提出多角度面部特征池评分机制，并加入KL散度正则化防止过拟合。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在特定主题视频生成方面取得进展，但在动态交互中难以保持多人物身份一致性，这在多角色场景中至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，包含人工标注和合成失真数据；采用针对多人物一致性优化的GRPO变体来增强VACE和Phantom方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为将强化学习与个性化视频生成对齐提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制，通过动态匹配相对位置解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的挑战，结合MatchDecoder实现高效分层解码，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配中存在的二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的问题，传统交叉注意力机制在处理高分辨率图像时效率低下。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样，通过残差连接迭代更新相对位置；设计MatchDecoder分层解码器，引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中平均误差排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T仅用3GB显存即可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像；在KITTI 2012/2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MatchAttention机制结合MatchDecoder实现了高精度、低计算复杂度的跨视图匹配，使实时高分辨率高精度匹配成为可能。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯溅射在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉细节和保持真实感，这主要源于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的精心结合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中域偏移问题的有力工具

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our

demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的三层对比解码方法，通过选择成熟层和业余层、使用水印问题识别视觉基础良好的枢轴层，来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但仍容易产生幻觉，过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而缺乏视觉基础。

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码加水印技术：选择解码层中的成熟层和业余层，通过水印相关问题识别视觉基础良好的枢轴层，然后应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Result: 在POPE、MME和AMBER等公开基准测试中，该方法在减少LVLM幻觉方面达到最先进性能，生成更具视觉基础的回答。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高了输出的视觉基础性，无需额外训练即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

*Shivangi Yadav,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MID-StyleGAN框架，结合扩散模型和GAN生成多领域合成眼部图像，解决虹膜生物识别系统中呈现攻击检测数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统易受呈现攻击，但现有PAD方法面临训练数据稀缺问题，因为构建和成像呈现攻击存在实际困难。

Method: 使用多领域图像转换扩散StyleGAN框架，结合扩散模型和GAN优势，通过多领域架构实现真实眼部图像与不同呈现攻击领域之间的转换，并采用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数。

Result: 在LivDet2020数据集上，1%误检率下的真检测率从93.41%提升至98.72%，显著提高了PAD系统性能。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题，为PAD系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流多模态大语言模型仅通过文本标记的下一个标记预测进行监督，忽略了视觉中心信息，这限制了模型的视觉分析能力。

Method: 引入可学习的模块化任务查询和视觉对齐层，在多个视觉基础模型的监督下激活特定视觉信号，并通过令牌网关掩码协调不同视觉基础模型之间的表示冲突。

Result: 大量实验表明，VaCo显著提升了不同多模态大语言模型在各种基准测试上的性能，展现了其在视觉理解方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: VaCo通过视觉中心激活和协调机制，有效解决了多模态大语言模型中视觉信息被忽视的问题，显著提升了模型的视觉理解性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用循环一致性关键点和新颖姿态块的自监督RGB-D配准方法，在ScanNet和3DMatch数据集上超越了之前的自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度相机的普及，大量未标记的RGB-D数据可用，需要探索如何利用这些数据进行场景几何推理。

Method: 使用循环一致性关键点作为显著点来增强空间一致性约束，并提出结合GRU循环单元和变换同步的新颖姿态块来融合历史和多视角数据。

Result: 在ScanNet和3DMatch数据集上超越了之前的自监督配准方法，甚至优于一些旧的监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了未标记RGB-D数据，提出的组件可以集成到现有方法中提升性能。

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

*Han Qiu,Peng Gao,Lewei Lu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR方法通过奖励MLLMs生成具有精确定位的详细响应，来增强多模态大语言模型的空间理解能力，解决了现有方法在细粒度空间感知方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在细粒度空间感知能力上存在不足，如生成详细区域描述或精确定位对象时表现不佳，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。这主要是因为现有方法主要关注对预标注指令数据的建模，而缺乏对模型实际响应的直接监督。

Method: SPR方法通过随机选择图像区域和MLLMs生成的区域描述，引入语义和定位评分来全面评估文本质量和定位质量。通过优化定位精度最佳的精炼描述与初始最低分描述的直接偏好，增强与视觉输入的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在标准引用和定位基准测试上的大量实验表明，SPR能够有效提升MLLMs的空间理解能力，且训练开销极小。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过空间偏好奖励机制，成功提升了MLLMs的细粒度空间感知能力，为解决多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS是一种通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来改进多对象图像生成的方法，能有效减少对象遗漏和混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象遗漏或对象混合问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景下。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于对CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入传递给文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS显著优于四种竞争方法，在四个基准测试中获得了26.24%-43.04%更多的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改进多对象图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，一种高效的3D脑肿瘤分割方法，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构捕获多尺度长程依赖关系，显著降低计算开销，并在BraTS2023数据集上实现性能提升和15倍效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba状态空间模型在脑肿瘤分割中面临计算开销大和跨不同数据划分鲁棒性不足的问题，需要更高效且可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射以保持空间局部性，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前向和反向上下文，引入量化块离散化特征以提高鲁棒性，并建立五个系统性折叠进行严格评估。

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice系数分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在系统性五折评估中，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice增益分别为0.86%和1.45%，同时实现15倍效率提升。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割中的鲁棒性和计算优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有PCB检测研究主要关注裸板或线路级缺陷，而组装级全主板检测研究不足，需要开发专门框架来检测螺丝缺失、风扇接线松动等组装问题。

Method: 提出BoardVision框架，基准测试YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN，设计轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，并评估在锐度、亮度、方向变化等扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: YOLOv7在精度上表现优异但召回率不足，Faster R-CNN则相反；CTV Voter集成方法有效平衡了性能指标；框架在真实扰动下显示出稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了计算机视觉技术从基准结果向实际主板制造质量保证的过渡，并发布了可部署的GUI检测工具连接研究评估与操作员可用性。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学面临全切片图像计算量大和密集标注稀缺的瓶颈，现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 使用易到难的渐进表示学习模型DCMIL，结合双课程对比多实例学习，直接处理千兆像素级全切片图像进行预后预测。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954患者，1,254万图块）上实验显示DCMIL优于标准预后模型，能识别细粒度预后相关区域并提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: DCMIL能有效处理全切片图像，识别形态学差异，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合帧内和帧间编码的神经视频压缩框架，通过统一模型自适应处理两种编码模式，有效解决现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容和帧间误差传播方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案存在多个局限性，包括处理遮挡和新内容效率低、帧间误差传播和累积等问题，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码工具来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出统一帧内和帧间编码的NVC框架，使用单一模型自适应执行帧内/帧间编码；采用同时两帧压缩设计，充分利用前向和后向帧间冗余。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方案比DCVC-RT平均减少10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一帧内和帧间编码框架有效解决了现有NVC方案的局限性，显著提升了压缩效率和稳定性，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的攻击方法在视频目标检测中表现出优越性能，为对抗攻击研究提供了有效工具，所有代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型参数量过大导致计算效率低下，需要找到既能处理多种图像退化类型又计算高效的方法

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重并重置剩余权重到原始初始化，发现高度稀疏的子网络

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务上的实验表明，MIR-L仅保留10%可训练参数仍能保持高性能

Conclusion: MIR-L证明了在高度稀疏条件下仍能维持或超越最先进性能的可行性

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Method: 利用Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据，对每个多边形定义的农田边界，使用4-10月的影像进行二元预测（放牧/未放牧）。训练CNN-LSTM集成模型处理多时相反射特征。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1分数为77%，放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。如果检查员每年最多只能访问4%的地点，使用模型预测的非放牧场地优先检查，比随机检查多发现17.2倍的非放牧确认场地。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率、免费可用的卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源，用于保护导向的土地用途合规监测。代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文首次将Vision Mamba作为骨干网络用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测，相比ViT和CNN具有更好的计算效率和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出比ViT更好的计算效率（线性缩放vs二次缩放），且比CNN需要更少的可训练参数，因此将其应用于三维多孔介质渗透率预测任务。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络模型，与ViT和CNN模型在渗透率预测任务上进行性能比较，并进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba相比ViT和CNN在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中的优势，包括计算效率和内存效率的提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT，源代码已公开以促进可复现性和后续研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种噪声投影器，通过文本条件优化将初始噪声映射到更适合预训练Stable Diffusion模型的提示感知噪声，以解决文本到图像生成中的训练-推理不匹配问题。

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中由于训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时噪声来自提示无关高斯先验导致的训练-推理不匹配问题，从而改善生成图像与文本提示的对齐质量。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，首先采样噪声并通过视觉语言模型获取对应图像的token级反馈，然后将这些信号蒸馏到奖励模型中，最后通过准直接偏好优化来优化噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提高不同提示下文本与图像的对齐质量，且推理成本低，无需参考图像或手工先验。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知噪声投影方法有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，提升了文本到图像生成的对齐性能，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于脑部MRI图像领域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过伪线性风格编码器对抗域适应方法，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提高模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MRI）在不同成像站点间存在领域偏移，这会降低机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 使用两个编码器f_E和f_SE分别提取领域不变特征z_u和领域特定特征z_d，通过解码器重建图像，并采用对抗训练确保特征解耦。通过将z_u和z_d的重构相加来重建输入图像。

Result: 在图像重建、疾病分类和领域识别任务中，PL-SE-ADA达到或优于现有方法性能，同时能够可视化领域无关的脑部特征和领域特定成分。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA不仅实现了有效的领域协调，还提供了高可解释性，能够可视化领域不变和领域特定的特征，为医疗应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面具有有效性，为现代学习从经典视觉线索中受益提供了可行途径。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调(PEFT)方法都是单步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集效果不足，需要更精确的跨模态对齐方法。

Method: 学习跨模态速度场，使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应，噪声增强策略缓解数据稀缺，早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上取得显著性能提升，特别是在挑战性数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，优于传统单步PEFT方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

Method: 提出场景去上下文化(SDeC)方法，通过识别和抑制身份提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份相关性，利用SVD方向稳定性自适应重新加权特征值。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种灵活通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先获取所有目标场景信息。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Motivation: 传统3DGS训练存在三个关键效率问题：高斯密度化中的偏斜密度分配、高斯投影中的不平衡计算负载以及颜色泼溅中的碎片化内存访问。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现了1.44倍的训练加速，同时质量退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3DGS训练中的效率瓶颈，显著提升了训练速度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point

re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline

keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANCE是一个图像到视频生成框架，通过实例线索和密集RoPE解决视频生成中的运动一致性问题，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中对象运动不连贯和交互困难的问题，特别是人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单一优化头偏向纹理而非时间一致性的瓶颈。

Method: 1. 实例线索：将稀疏的用户可编辑提示转换为密集的2.5D运动场；2. 密集RoPE：在token空间中保持运动线索的显著性；3. 联合RGB+辅助图预测。

Result: 提高了时间一致性，稳定了优化过程，无需逐帧轨迹脚本即可实现连贯的对象运动。

Conclusion: STANCE通过简单的组件有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，在保持易用性的同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动物分类模型如SpeciesNet使用保守的汇总策略，导致许多动物只能在高级分类学层面标记而非物种级别

Method: 五阶段流水线：高置信度接受、鸟类覆盖、质心构建、三元组损失度量学习和自适应余弦距离评分，结合SpeciesNet预测与CLIP嵌入

Result: 在LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation数据集上，重新分类456个检测，准确率达96.5%，64.9%达到物种级别识别

Conclusion: 该系统能有效将高级别分类标签细化为物种级别识别，显著提升动物分类的精确度

Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide
predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies,
resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species.
We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect
platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP
embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward
species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence
acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and
adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC
Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After
recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify
456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy, achieving
species-level identification for 64.9 percent

TL;DR: 评估在相机陷阱图像中使用自监督视觉变换器进行零样本分类的方法，比较了不同架构和聚类技术，并在生产环境中部署了连续相似性排序系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱产生大量野生动物图像，但许多数据集包含现有分类器无法识别的物种，需要零样本方法来组织未标记的野生动物图像。

Method: 在Animal Detect平台中比较无监督聚类方法（DBSCAN、GMM）和三种架构（CLIP、DINOv2、MegaDescriptor），结合降维技术（PCA、UMAP），并通过t-SNE投影实现连续1D相似性排序。

Result: 在5物种测试集上，DINOv2+UMAP+GMM达到88.6%准确率（macro-F1=0.874），1D排序在哺乳动物和鸟类中达到88.2%一致性，在鱼类中达到95.2%一致性。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，在生产环境中部署了连续相似性排序，显著加速了生物多样性监测中的探索性分析和手动标注工作流程。

Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain
species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates
zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using
self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal
Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering
methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor)
combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we
demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a
5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2
with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D
sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent
for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous
similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and
accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出Wiki-PRF三阶段方法，通过处理、检索和过滤阶段改进KB-VQA任务，结合视觉工具和强化学习训练，在基准数据集上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KB-VQA中多模态查询质量差和检索结果相关性不足的问题，提升视觉语言模型在外部知识检索方面的能力。

Method: 三阶段方法：1)处理阶段动态调用视觉工具提取精确多模态信息；2)检索阶段整合视觉和文本特征进行多模态知识检索；3)过滤阶段进行相关性过滤和结果浓缩。使用强化学习训练模型，以答案准确性和格式一致性作为奖励信号。

Result: 在E-VQA和InfoSeek基准数据集上分别提升36.0和42.8分，在答案质量方面取得显著改进，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法有效解决了KB-VQA中的关键挑战，通过多阶段处理和强化学习训练显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption是一个用于羽毛球视频语义和时间多尺度字幕生成的框架，能够生成描述单个动作的击球级字幕和捕捉战术执行过程的战术级字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 羽毛球战术理解不仅需要解释单个动作，还需要理解战术如何随时间动态执行。现有方法缺乏对战术执行过程的描述能力。

Method: 采用双分支设计，包括视觉编码器、时空Transformer编码器和基于Transformer的解码器。引入战术单元检测器识别有效战术单元、类型和状态，并使用击球级提示引导机制将预测的战术类型和状态作为提示注入解码器。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成击球和战术字幕方面有效。消融研究显示基于ResNet50的时空编码器优于其他变体，击球级提示结构能产生更连贯准确的战术字幕。

Conclusion: Shot2Tactic-Caption框架成功实现了羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕生成，能够描述成功执行的战术以及被中断后恢复的战术执行过程。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS是一种简单即插即用的视频采样方法，通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少视频中的令牌冗余，显著降低令牌数量同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从静态图像理解扩展到视频推理时，处理密集帧序列的二次成本限制了其可扩展性。长视频经常超过现代语言模型的令牌预算，导致严重的上下文限制和延迟问题。

Method: EVS通过识别和剪枝时间上静态的补丁来减少令牌冗余，保留位置身份，无需架构更改或重新训练。在推理时应用EVS，结合使用随机剪枝率的上训练阶段。

Result: EVS将大型语言模型的首令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，且精度损失最小。当结合上训练时，模型对不同程度的压缩具有鲁棒性，在激进剪枝下仍保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下实现可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器的单个连续潜在token来表示图像，通过微调语义token嵌入和训练生成解码器，实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时利用自监督学习表示作为紧凑有效的潜在空间进行生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练SSL编码器，仅微调语义token嵌入，配合使用流匹配目标训练的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失保持原始SSL空间几何特性。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限训练预算达到竞争性零样本性能，自然扩展到文本到图像合成。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督学习表示可作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效生成建模，单token公式显著降低训练成本并保持良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度的扩散方法在测试时自适应中的局限性，这些方法限制了探索能力且难以泛化到不同类型的失真。

Method: 使用Feynman-Kac引导来指导基于扩散的输入自适应，通过伪标签驱动的奖励机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，结合累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索与置信度。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于基线方法，无需任何模型更新或源数据。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA通过引导扩散过程有效提升了测试时自适应的性能，特别是在处理分布偏移时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于指令的视频编辑领域因构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集成本高昂而发展受限的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在约100万真实视频片段上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万高质量编辑对上进行微调。

Result: 在编辑指令遵循和视觉保真度方面均优于现有方法，编辑指令遵循提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效降低了视频编辑模型的训练成本，同时显著提升了编辑性能，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本和时间。


<details>

Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现良好但计算成本高昂，难以在时间和资源受限的工业环境中应用。

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP方法，通过迭代减少各层输入相关性来加速收敛。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点。在工业数据上也观察到类似收益。

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中减少训练时间和能耗，同时提升下游任务性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个可持续性任务：多时序采矿足迹制图和跨时序变化检测，使用新的Change-Aware Temporal IoU指标评估。

Result: 对20个最先进深度学习模型的基准测试显示，GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，为可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性以及GeoAI的社会环境应用做出贡献，并遵循FAIR原则和开放科学范式发布代码和数据集。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强教师模型或大数据集，在现实世界有限数据场景下效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还进行知识精炼后传递给后续模型。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在其他两个医学影像数据集上验证了泛化能力，相比单骨干网络准确率提升高达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过结构化知识传递链，在有限监督下实现了高效学习，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半自动化的鲸鱼检测方法，使用统计异常检测识别空间异常点，结合网页标注界面让专家快速标注，大幅减少需要专家检查的区域面积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲸鱼种群监测方法昂贵且难以扩展，而现有基于高分辨率卫星图像的自动检测面临标注数据缺乏、图像质量变化和环境条件差异等挑战。

Method: 采用统计异常检测方法标记空间异常点作为潜在鲸鱼检测，配合专门设计的网页标注界面供专家快速验证。

Result: 在三个基准场景测试中，召回率达到90.3%-96.4%，同时将需要专家检查的区域面积减少高达99.8%（从超过1000平方公里降至不到2平方公里）。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖标注训练数据，为未来机器辅助的海洋哺乳动物空间监测提供了可扩展的第一步，已开源相关代码。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings
highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to
low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力方法局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表征间的丰富层间依赖关系，难以应对大尺度变化的目标检测

Method: CFSAM包含三个组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表征）

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM，PASCAL VOC上mAP达到78.6%（基线75.5%），COCO上达到52.1%（基线43.1%），优于现有注意力模块

Conclusion: 显式的跨层注意力建模对于推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义，该模块在不增加显著计算开销的同时加速了训练收敛

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注粒度各不相同，受图像质量、标注者专业知识和任务需求影响，而现有方法通常假设完整的细粒度标注，这在实践中很少满足。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性来生成混合粒度的标注，提出free-grain学习方法，通过视觉语言模型生成伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提高了分层分类性能。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准测试和free-grain学习方法在现实世界约束下推进了分层图像分类的发展。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明可信的AI系统至关重要。现有方法通常需要训练数据或真实标签，而DEXTER旨在无需这些信息就能生成自然语言解释。

Method: DEXTER通过优化文本提示来合成类条件图像，这些图像能强烈激活目标分类器。然后使用这些合成样本生成详细的自然语言报告，描述类别特定的决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces数据集上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类别级偏见报告方面优于现有方法。定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示DEXTER产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER是一个灵活的无数据框架，能够揭示视觉分类器的内部机制，在激活最大化、切片发现和去偏、偏见解释等任务中表现出色，为构建透明AI系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Motivation: 现有方法在低光条件下由于像素级信息严重退化，难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影问题

Method: 设计光量化模块(LQM)显式提取和量化光照相关因子，增强光不变表示；引入光感知提示模块(LAPM)将光照先验编码为可学习提示，动态指导特征学习

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性光照场景下提供优越的定性和定量结果

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习，能够实现跨不同光照条件的一致和鲁棒图像质量增强

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，通过训练12000个火星高度图数据集，在重建精度和感知相似性方面优于传统插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球的基于条件的方法无法应用于火星，因此需要开发专门的火星地形重建方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在NASA HiRISE调查的12000个火星高度图数据集上进行训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个样本的评估集上，该方法在重建精度（RMSE提升4-15%）和感知相似性（LPIPS提升29-81%）方面均优于逆距离加权、克里金法和纳维-斯托克斯算法等传统方法。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，在保持几何一致性和地形特征方面表现出色，为行星探索中的虚拟现实应用提供了可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为MAV蜂群提供了一种节能可靠的通信替代方案，特别适用于受限环境。

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

TL;DR: CoT-PL是一个通过结构化视觉思维链推理来提升开放词汇目标检测伪标签质量的框架，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接的图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡场景中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：(1) 区域感知（包括未见对象），(2) 通过零样本推理进行类别识别，(3) 背景接地以分离语义复杂对象，并引入对比背景学习来促进对象与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量分别比之前最佳方法提升了103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上获得+7.7 AP50，在LVIS上新类别获得+2.9 mask AP，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化思维链推理和对比背景学习，有效提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性，特别是在拥挤和遮挡条件下的性能表现。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球第三大常见恶性肿瘤，现有基础模型往往忽视器官特异性关键形态模式，这些模式代表不同的生物过程，能从根本上影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了每个不同形态内的连续变异谱，反映恶性转化通过渐进进化过程而非突然表型转变的原理。模型在424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像上训练。

Conclusion: PRISM模型通过整合连续形态变异谱，成功表征了结直肠癌的表型多样性，在预后预测方面显著优于现有方法，为精准医疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

Motivation: 现有的轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对轨迹形成的影响，这限制了表示的有效性。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器。环境感知模块从周围POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义来增强路网表示；路径选择编码器将路段转换建模为决策序列来捕捉路径选择行为。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有很好的数据效率和实用性。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分数位量化方法，通过渐进式降低模型精度并利用分数位优化来保持生成质量，在多种扩散模型上实现了优于标准QAT的性能，并成功在智能手机上部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大容量生成模型在智能手机上部署时面临的内存和计算限制问题，同时保持模型质量。

Method: 提出分数位量化方法，从32位渐进降低到4位精度，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持生成质量。

Result: 在SD3.5-Medium、Sana、Pixart和FLUX.1-schnell等扩散模型上实现了改进的质量，FiD比标准QAT低4-7%。成功在三星S25U手机上部署Sana模型。

Conclusion: 分数位量化方法有效解决了移动设备上部署生成模型的挑战，在保持质量的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: 该论文发现AI肿瘤分割性能在1500个标注扫描后停止提升，通过合成数据仅用500个真实扫描即可达到相同性能，创建了包含10,135个CT扫描的AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，在六个器官上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI肿瘤分割面临的大规模体素级标注数据缺乏问题，这些数据难以创建且需要医学专家参与。

Method: 使用合成数据增强真实数据训练效率，创建了包含10,135个CT扫描的AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含六个器官的15,130个肿瘤实例标注和5,893个对照扫描。

Result: 合成数据可以显著提升数据扩展效率，仅用500个真实扫描即可达到1500个扫描的性能。AbdomenAtlas 2.0在分布内测试中DSC提升7%，分布外测试中提升16%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能够显著提升数据扩展规律，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练六个器官的肿瘤分割AI提供了强大基础，性能显著优于现有公共数据集。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

TL;DR: QDepth-VLA是一个增强VLA模型空间感知能力的框架，通过深度预测任务学习深度感知表示，提升精细操作任务中的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型缺乏对3D结构的理解和推理能力，无法满足精细操作任务的需求。

Method: 设计专门的深度专家模块，预测VQ-VAE编码器获得的深度图的量化潜在标记，学习包含关键几何线索的深度感知表示。

Result: 在仿真基准和真实世界任务上的实验表明，QDepth-VLA具有强大的空间推理能力和在操作任务上的竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过深度预测任务增强VLA模型可以有效提升其空间感知和推理能力，在精细操作任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在现实场景表现出色，但在想象力场景中性能显著下降，这些场景涉及罕见共现概念和长距离语义关系，超出了训练分布范围。

Method: ImagerySearch是一种提示引导的自适应测试时间搜索策略，根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数。

Result: 在LDT-Bench基准测试中，ImagerySearch始终优于强基线视频生成方法和现有测试时间缩放方法，在VBench上也取得了有竞争力的改进。

Conclusion: ImagerySearch方法有效提升了想象力视频生成的质量和连贯性，提出的LDT-Bench基准将促进该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

TL;DR: 提出一个深度学习框架，不仅能对皮肤病变进行分类，还能量化ABCDE特征评分，模拟病变随时间演变过程，为医生提供可解释的AI诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法对皮肤病变分析缺乏可解释性，ABCDE分类法中的人类可理解特征未被充分解释，需要建立连接AI诊断与临床标准的框架。

Method: 开发深度学习框架，分类皮肤病变并量化ABCD特征评分，模拟E特征的演变过程，在潜在空间中可视化特征轨迹。使用HAM10000数据集进行实验。

Result: 分类准确率约89%，黑色素瘤AUC为0.96。特征评估在不对称性、颜色变化和直径预测表现良好，但边界不规则性建模较困难。

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能够将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，有助于更好地理解皮肤癌进展过程。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态学习方法，通过预训练专家模型和程序化组合，在无需人工监督的情况下整合多种视觉模态，并开发了高效的小参数模型PHG-MAE，在实时语义分割等任务上取得与大型模型相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界本质上是多模态的，但传统机器学习模型多为单模态或双模态。为了真正理解世界，需要整合所有独立模态，特别是视觉模态，同时减少人工监督的需求。

Method: 使用预训练专家模型和程序化组合方法，构建全自动数据流水线，采用专门设计的PHG-MAE模型来利用多模态数据，并将模型高效蒸馏为小参数模型（<1M）。

Result: 开发的小参数模型（<1M）在性能上可与约300M参数的大型模型竞争，成功部署了实时语义分割和近实时深度估计等应用。

Conclusion: 通过多模态整合和高效模型设计，可以在保持高性能的同时显著减少模型参数，为在普通硬件上部署实时视觉应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在面部识别领域的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是需要与现有面部识别模型在标准基准上进行公平比较。

Method: 在多个面部识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB、RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统基准测试，采用相似协议与现有模型比较。

Result: 实验结果显示，MLLMs能够捕捉对面部相关任务有用的丰富语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中仍落后于专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的面部识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，基于物理先验如力闭合或通用意图指令，这种过度泛化的条件约束导致无法捕捉日常HOI的多样性。

Method: 构建了WildO2数据集（包含4.4k个独特交互），提出了TOUCH框架，采用三级扩散模型，通过显式接触建模实现细粒度语义控制，并结合接触一致性和物理约束进行优化。

Result: 综合实验证明该方法能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互，能够代表日常活动中的各种交互模式。

Conclusion: Free-Form HOI Generation方法成功扩展了手-物体交互的范围，从抓握扩展到自由形式交互，为更自然和多样化的人机交互提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和不涉及自车的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，重新标注主要基准数据集以识别自车参与情况，添加共识警报时间标签，并在需要时合成负样本。提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个版本。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS模型有效解决了自车威胁识别问题，作者发布了BADAS-Open模型权重、代码以及所有评估数据集的重新标注，以促进自车中心碰撞预测研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Motivation: 虽然视觉自回归模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在该范式下实现精确灵活的控制机制仍未被充分探索，需要弥合这一关键差距。

Method: 提出改进的MMDiT块和Reference Attention模块，通过丢弃图像→条件的不必要注意力来降低计算成本并稳定控制注入，采用参数重用策略和零初始化线性投影来有效整合控制信号。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量的生成和精确控制，同时相比基于扩散的方法具有更优越的效率。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用且有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案，代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，而细粒度视觉分类任务通常涉及数百到数千个高度相关的选项，且不清楚如何将LLM选择提取扩展到基于检索的问题。

Method: nlg2choice是一个两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码来预测最可能的选择。在检索设置中，采用早期停止方法计算约束响应选择该选项的概率。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索方面均优于现有方法，且性能在不同自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉分类中处理大量选项和自由形式响应的评估问题，显著提高了吞吐量。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及对象交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM分析不同时刻的对象对视觉输入，生成活动和交互的文本描述，在测试时与正常训练视频的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法不仅有效检测复杂交互异常，还提供内在可解释性，并能与传统VAD方法结合增强可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Motivation: 解决密集视频目标字幕任务中由于标注成本高而采用分离训练策略导致的性能次优问题。

Method: 利用先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，构建LVISCap和LV-VISCap数据集，训练端到端的MaskCaptioner模型。

Result: 在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个基准测试中取得最优结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕数据预训练可以有效解决DVOC任务的数据稀缺问题，实现端到端的联合检测、跟踪和字幕生成。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全身多模态人体运动生成的两个主要挑战：创建有效的运动生成机制，以及将文本、语音、音乐等多种模态整合到统一框架中。

Method: 开发连续掩码自回归运动变换器，采用因果注意力机制；引入门控线性注意力和RMSNorm模块；使用DiT结构扩散条件信息；通过AdaLN和交叉注意力融合文本、语音、音乐等不同模态。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在所有模态（文本到运动、语音到手势、音乐到舞蹈）上都优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RealDPO对齐范式，利用真实世界数据作为偏好学习的正样本，通过DPO和定制损失函数提升视频生成中的运动真实感，解决了现有模型在复杂运动生成上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在合成复杂运动时存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、流畅和上下文一致，这限制了其实际应用。需要一种方法来解决生成运动与真实世界运动之间的差距。

Method: 引入RealDPO对齐范式，使用真实世界视频作为正样本进行偏好学习，采用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)和定制损失函数，通过对比真实视频与错误模型输出来实现迭代自校正。同时构建RealAction-5K数据集支持复杂运动合成的后训练。

Result: 大量实验表明，RealDPO相比最先进模型和现有偏好优化技术，显著提升了视频质量、文本对齐度和运动真实感。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过利用真实世界数据进行偏好学习，有效解决了视频生成中复杂运动合成的挑战，显著提升了运动真实感和整体视频质量。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在需要视觉辅助的数学领域（如几何）表现不佳，主要受限于外部工具的僵化性和无法生成高质量、适时出现的图表。

Method: 分两阶段：1）视觉操作阶段预训练模型掌握图表生成和编辑；2）策略性视觉辅助推理阶段微调模型学习何时及如何利用视觉辅助。

Result: BAGEL-Canvas模型在MathCanvas-Bench基准上相比强基线有86%的相对提升，在其他公共数学基准上也表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个完整的工具包（框架、数据集和基准），为解锁LMMs中复杂、类人的视觉辅助推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过引入短期光流和长期点跟踪对应关系，将现有3D重建方法扩展到动态场景，实现几何和相机姿态的联合估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于点图的3D重建方法在静态场景中表现良好，但直接应用于动态场景会导致不准确结果，因为运动物体违反多视图几何约束。需要专门处理动态场景的4D重建方法。

Method: 提出C4D框架，包含：1) 预测点图；2) 捕获短期光流和长期点跟踪对应关系；3) 训练动态感知点跟踪器提供移动性信息；4) 估计运动掩码分离移动元素和静态背景；5) 引入动态场景优化目标恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数。

Result: 实验表明C4D实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功将3D重建扩展到4D动态场景，为动态场景理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成令牌注意力的扩散模型，用于降水临近预报，无需单独潜在模块即可有效捕捉多尺度时空依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在降水临近预报中存在可扩展性问题：潜在空间方法需要单独训练自编码器，增加复杂性；像素空间方法计算量大且缺乏注意力机制，难以建模长程时空依赖。

Method: 在U-Net扩散模型和时空编码器中集成令牌注意力机制，动态捕捉多尺度空间交互和时间演化，无需单独潜在模块。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进方法，在复杂降水预报场景中具有更好的局部保真度、泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的令牌注意力集成方法有效解决了扩散模型在降水临近预报中的可扩展性问题，实现了更优的预测性能。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于解决动态场景下的3D视觉定位问题，通过利用历史观察和选择性探索来减少重新扫描成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中机器人需要在场景不断变化的情况下从自然语言指令中定位物体，但现有3D视觉定位方法假设点云已重建且最新，这需要昂贵的重新扫描，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法：通过跨模态检索识别查询中的物体类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，当先前操作无效时回退，执行多视角扫描，并将融合证据投影以获得准确物体边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大大降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法旨在推动面向实际应用的、以记忆为中心的3D视觉定位研究发展。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对文本到图像生成中的身份一致性生成问题，提出了WithAnyone模型，通过构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M、引入新的评估基准和对比身份损失函数，有效解决了现有方法中存在的copy-paste复制粘贴问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份一致性生成方法因缺乏大规模多图像配对数据集，大多采用基于重建的训练方式，导致模型容易直接复制参考面部特征而非保持身份在姿态、表情或光照自然变化中的一致性，这种过度相似性限制了生成的可控性和表达能力。

Method: 构建了大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M，专为多人物场景设计；提出了量化copy-paste伪影和身份保真度与变化之间权衡的评估基准；引入了基于对比学习的身份损失函数，利用配对数据平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了copy-paste伪影，提高了对姿态和表情的可控性，同时保持了强大的感知质量。用户研究验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建、评估基准设计和新的训练范式，WithAnyone模型成功解决了身份一致性生成中的copy-paste问题，在保持身份相似性的同时实现了更好的可控性和生成多样性。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的动画生成框架，使用两个条件扩散模型从交互姿态生成动态运动序列或合成交互姿态，支持图像动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态信息，人类能够从中推断上下文并预测过去和未来动态。受此启发，作者希望利用交互姿态先验来生成多样化的交互动画。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；姿态生成器利用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。训练数据来自运动捕捉交互数据集中的近距离双人姿态及其时间上下文。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用中的实证实验证明了姿态先验的通用性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量运动捕捉数据中的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界的固有3D特性，这会破坏3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点云到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，再解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成任务上达到了最先进的性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程的灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现了可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取。现有解决方案使用合成训练对会传播预训练模型的伪影

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型：训练时展开模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供直接梯度进行端到端优化；同时结合分布匹配损失确保视觉保真度

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据，该方法在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的各种图像编辑扩散模型性能相当；使用相同VLM作为奖励模型时，也优于如Flow-GRPO等基于强化学习的技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了对配对数据的依赖，通过VLM反馈和分布匹配损失的结合，实现了高效的无监督图像编辑训练

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视角一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，无需复杂3D优化过程。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

### [226] [Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921)
*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Weight Weaving方法，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中聚合模型权重，实现无需评估数据的模型合并，在多种实验设置中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的λ设置原则方法，研究者通常使用评估数据调优λ，这在实践中不可行。

Method: Weight Weaving技术，使用池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中聚合模型权重，具有高模块化且无需评估数据。

Result: 在三种ViT变体和三种实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习、领域泛化）中验证，平均准确率在无数据设置下提升高达15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving作为即插即用技术，与现有模型合并方法正交，消除了评估数据需求，显著提升了模型合并性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于逆问题中的信号恢复，通过分布级校准替代逐点匹配，避免对测量噪声的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数如均方误差或负对数似然寻求与噪声测量的逐点一致性，往往导致对噪声的过拟合。本文旨在通过统计一致性评估来改进这一问题。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，使用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量进行分布级校准，作为标准数据一致性项的直接替代方案，与现代正则化器兼容且优化方式相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失替代MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一个统计基础扎实、性能提升的替代方案，可替代传统的保真度损失函数。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可逆模型合并方法，用于解决低秩压缩模型合并时的性能下降问题，通过构建重构能力强的模型空间而非单一合并模型来保持各任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型合并方法在应用于低秩权重时会导致严重的性能下降，特别是在LoRA或SVD压缩场景下，需要新的方法来保持各任务模型的性能。

Method: 提出可逆模型合并方法，构建紧凑基向量空间，通过线性组合恢复原始任务特定模型，提供闭式解来选择最优权重基和任务特定系数。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型规模上的实验表明，RMM显著优于现有合并方法，大幅保留了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: 将模型合并重新定义为生成可重构模型空间而非单一合并模型，能够有效解决低秩模型合并的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种简单有效的反学习方法来移除基础模型中的后门攻击，利用后门与良性任务在权重空间中的解耦特性，实现了近乎完美的后门移除，同时保持96%的干净准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然具有广泛泛化能力，但极易受到对抗性扰动和针对性后门攻击。现有后门移除方法依赖昂贵的微调，往往会降低模型在其他无关任务上的性能。本文旨在研究是否能在不损害模型通用能力的前提下移除后门。

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与良性任务是解耦的，基于这一洞察提出了一种简单的反学习方法。该方法利用解耦特性隔离并消除后门对模型的影响，即使攻击未知时也能通过反向工程触发器成功移除后门。

Result: 在CLIP基础模型和常见对抗性触发器的广泛实验中，该方法在已知攻击情况下实现了近乎完美的反学习，平均保持96%的干净准确率。与现有最先进防御方法相比，始终获得更好的反学习和干净准确率权衡。

Conclusion: 通过利用后门与良性任务在权重空间中的解耦特性，可以在不显著影响模型性能的情况下有效移除后门攻击，为保护基础模型安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow是一种基于策略的流模型，通过修改学生模型的输出层来预测网络无关的策略，从而在少量步数内实现快速准确的ODE积分，避免了传统蒸馏方法中的质量-多样性权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的少步扩散或流模型蒸馏方法存在师生模型格式不匹配的问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡。需要一种更简单有效的方法来匹配师生模型的行为。

Method: π-Flow修改学生流模型的输出层，使其预测一个网络无关的策略，该策略能在未来子步骤产生动态流速度，实现无需额外网络评估的快速ODE积分。采用模仿蒸馏方法，使用标准ℓ2流匹配损失来匹配策略速度与教师模型在策略轨迹上的速度。

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上，1-NFE FID达到2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow。在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上，4 NFEs时实现了比最先进少步方法更好的多样性，同时保持教师级别的质量。

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师模型行为，实现了稳定可扩展的训练，避免了质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ICD编码自动分配方法，将传统的分类任务重新定义为分类和排序任务，以考虑ICD代码的顺序重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD代码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法仅将其视为分类任务而忽略了代码顺序。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将其制定为分类和排序任务，以同时考虑代码分配和优先级排序。

Result: 模型在正确排序主要诊断代码方面的准确率达到47%，优于现有最佳分类器的20%；在分类指标上，微平均和宏平均F1分数分别为0.6065和0.2904，均超过之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面具有优越能力，同时保持了良好的分类性能，为ICD代码自动分配提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一个轻量级框架，可将全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1,0,1}），在特定下游任务上实现接近全精度模型的性能，同时显著降低内存占用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时的高内存消耗和计算成本问题，通过极低精度量化实现高效推理，同时保持任务特定性能。

Method: 结合三个关键技术：SubLN模块（来自BitNet）、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练，缓解全精度与1.58位模型在特定任务上的性能差距。

Result: 实验结果显示，BitDistill在不同模型规模下都能达到与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种高效的方法，通过极低精度量化在保持性能的同时显著降低大语言模型的部署成本，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

Conclusion: 弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: 提示优化管道应被视为一级攻击面，需要加强对反馈通道和优化框架的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: AEPO是一种代理强化学习算法，通过动态熵平衡机制解决传统方法过度依赖熵信号导致的训练崩溃问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流代理RL算法过度依赖熵信号来指导高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1) 动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2) 熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并整合熵感知优势估计。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO一致优于7种主流RL算法。Qwen3-14B仅用1K RL样本就取得显著成果：GAIA 47.6%、Humanity's Last Exam 11.2%、WebWalker 43.0%（Pass@1）；GAIA 65.0%、Humanity's Last Exam 26.0%、WebWalker 70.0%（Pass@5）。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，促进了可扩展的web代理训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需额外训练的推理采样算法，通过纯采样方法在推理时激发基础模型的推理能力，效果接近甚至超过RL后训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以在不进行额外训练的情况下，仅通过纯采样方法在推理时激发基础模型的推理能力，避免RL后训练带来的多样性下降问题。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出基于基础模型自身似然的简单迭代采样算法，无需训练、精选数据集或验证器。

Result: 在MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等单次任务上，该方法显著提升推理能力，效果接近甚至超过RL后训练，同时避免了RL方法的多样本多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了无需训练即可激发基础模型推理能力的可行性，具有超越可验证领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了WeightLens和CircuitLens两种互补方法，通过分析权重而非仅依赖激活来增强神经网络的可解释性，解决了现有方法依赖外部LLM和数据集的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖手动检查且局限于简单任务，自动化方法又容易忽略特征间交互且依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。需要更系统化的电路分析方法。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习到的权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能识别仅靠激活分析无法发现的电路级动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提高了可解释性的鲁棒性，增强了电路的可扩展机制分析，同时保持了效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型原理的采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成过程，可在不调整现有模型的情况下实现最高5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来改进生成效率。

Method: 开发了新的扩散强制采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 理论上，该采样器比相同时间预算下的自回归生成更具表达能力；在3.5B参数的循环深度transformer上直接应用，可实现最高5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该采样器为循环深度模型在推理时并行化额外计算提供了高效机制，并表明这类模型可自然地视为强大的连续因果扩散语言模型。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

TL;DR: 开发了一个计算框架，通过整合用户历史帖子和社交近邻的讨论来早期检测社交媒体上的隐性自杀意念，相比仅基于个人信息的基线方法提升了15%的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多有自杀意念的社交媒体用户不会明确表达痛苦，而是通过日常帖子或同伴互动间接表现出来。早期检测这些隐性信号至关重要但具有挑战性。

Method: 采用复合网络中心性度量识别用户的重要邻居，将用户和邻居的互动进行时间对齐，在微调的DeBERTa-v3模型中整合多层信号。

Result: 在Reddit上对1000名用户（500案例和500对照）的研究中，该方法比仅基于个人信息的基线方法提升了15%的早期隐性自杀意念检测效果。

Conclusion: 同伴互动提供了有价值的预测信号，对设计能够捕捉在线环境中间接和伪装风险表达的早期检测系统具有广泛意义。

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机械臂的顺从人机协作已广泛发展，但由于人形机器人复杂的全身动力学，实现顺从的人-人形机器人协作仍未被充分探索。

Method: COLA方法在单一策略中结合领导者和跟随者行为，在闭环环境中训练，通过协调轨迹规划预测物体运动模式和人类意图，维持负载平衡。

Result: 模拟实验显示模型减少24.7%的人力消耗，真实世界实验验证了在不同物体类型和运动模式下的鲁棒性，用户研究显示相比基线模型平均提升27.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界部署提供了实用解决方案，实现了无需外部传感器或复杂交互模型的顺从人-人形协作搬运。

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: GOPLA是一个分层框架，通过增强的人类演示学习可泛化的物体放置，结合语义偏好和几何可行性，在真实世界机器人放置场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人作为智能助手在家庭环境中进行物体放置时，需要同时考虑语义偏好（常识性物体关系）和几何可行性（碰撞避免）的核心挑战。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型将人类指令和视觉输入转换为结构化计划，空间映射器生成具有几何常识的3D可操作性地图，基于扩散的规划器生成考虑多计划分布和碰撞避免的放置姿态，并通过可扩展管道扩展人类演示数据。

Result: 在定位精度和物理合理性评估中，相比第二名方法提高了30.04个百分点的放置成功率，在广泛的真实世界机器人放置场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOPLA框架通过分层方法有效解决了物体放置问题，结合语义和几何推理，在数据稀缺情况下仍能实现优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

TL;DR: RoboGhost是一个免重定向的人形机器人框架，直接基于语言引导的运动潜在空间来调节策略，绕过了传统的多阶段运动解码和重定向过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的人形机器人运动流程存在多阶段错误累积、高延迟和语义与控制弱耦合的问题，需要更直接的语言到动作路径。

Method: 采用基于扩散的策略直接从噪声中反噪可执行动作，使用混合因果transformer-diffusion运动生成器确保长时程一致性和稳定性。

Result: 实验显示RoboGhost显著降低了部署延迟，提高了成功率和跟踪精度，在真实人形机器人上产生平滑、语义对齐的运动。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉-语言-动作人形系统提供了通用基础，可自然扩展到图像、音频和音乐等其他模态。

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

Motivation: 现有VLM规划器需要人工标注或启发式规则来分解任务，但启发式子任务可能与底层视觉运动策略的训练数据存在偏差，影响任务性能

Method: RDD通过将分解的子任务区间的视觉特征与底层视觉运动策略训练数据的特征进行对齐，自动分解演示为子任务

Result: 在仿真和真实世界任务中均优于最先进的子任务分解器，在不同设置下表现出鲁棒性

Conclusion: RDD方法有效解决了任务分解中的偏差问题，提升了分层VLA框架的整体性能

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are
available at rdd-neurips.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过生成式人工智能提升文化遗产实践中公共指导文件的可访问性，帮助资源有限的文化遗产组织自动化部分指导文件编写工作。

Method: 开发了专门针对文化遗产保护指导文件修订的GenAI聊天机器人HAZEL，并通过定量评估将其与ChatGPT(GPT-4)在指导文件编写相关任务中的表现进行比较。

Result: HAZEL在性能上略优于ChatGPT，表明经过微调后GenAI聊天机器人更有效，但在需要文化敏感性和高级技术专长的领域仍存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 虽然GenAI无法在技术编写任务中完全替代人类文化遗产专家，但其在自动化和加速指导文件编写某些方面的潜力可为文化遗产组织，特别是资源受限的环境提供宝贵价值。

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能广泛，但在没有具体目标时往往产生平庸的结果。论文旨在通过推断用户的即时目标来优化LLM输出，使其更符合用户需求。

Method: 提出了一种架构，通过被动观察用户行为自动诱导即时目标，然后引导下游AI系统根据这些目标进行生成和评估。

Result: 在实验中，JIT目标使LLM输出在用户自身任务上获得了66-86%的胜率，现场使用会话确认了JIT目标能为每个参与者生成独特的专用工具。

Conclusion: 通过推断用户的即时目标并基于此优化LLM，可以生成更响应和符合需求的工具、界面和响应。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains
difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and
limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent
framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist
vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool
$\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The
system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly
using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool
expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by
existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling
self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation
benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new
datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models.
It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative
text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting
performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust,
adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are

Motivation: 现有网格网络架构在学习高频特征、感受野范围、对离散化的敏感性和计算效率之间存在微妙的权衡问题，需要一种更好的解决方案。

Method: 采用局部-全局学习方案，在网格的梯度域应用学习的局部特征变换，然后求解泊松系统以在表面上全局传播标量特征更新。

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

### [252] [Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991)
*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Shengeng Tang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态虚假内容检测框架UMFDet，整合处理人为虚假信息和AI生成内容，通过类别感知MoE适配器和归因链式思维机制实现跨类型检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人为虚假信息和AI生成内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型虚假内容，而现实场景中内容类型未知，需要统一检测框架。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因链式思维机制提供隐性推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专门化基线模型。

Conclusion: UMFDet为现实世界多模态虚假内容检测提供了实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

TL;DR: 提出了AI4Service新范式，通过Alpha-Service框架实现主动式AI助手，能够从第一人称视角视频中检测服务机会并提供个性化服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI服务大多是被动的，只能响应显式用户命令。真正智能的助手应该能够预测用户需求并在适当时机主动采取行动。

Method: 基于AI眼镜，采用多智能体系统实现Alpha-Service框架，包含五个核心组件：输入单元、中央处理单元、算术逻辑单元、内存单元和输出单元，灵感来源于冯·诺依曼计算机架构。

Result: 通过案例研究（实时21点顾问、博物馆导览、购物搭配助手）证明系统能够无缝感知环境、推断用户意图，无需显式提示即可提供及时有用的帮助。

Conclusion: AI4Service范式将AI从被动工具转变为主动伴侣，Alpha-Service框架为实现这一愿景提供了可行方案，展示了在日常生活场景中提供实时主动服务的潜力。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造性任务，特别是复杂的机器设计，这是人类智能的标志和工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于部件的构造、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估；使用代理工作流程对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试；探索强化学习微调作为改进方法。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、战略组装和指令遵循等关键能力方面表现不足；通过RL微调实验展示了改进潜力，但该领域仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 在语言、机器设计和物理推理的交叉领域仍存在开放挑战，需要进一步研究来提升LLMs在复杂机器设计任务中的表现。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种融合视觉信息（特别是演示文稿幻灯片）的多模态自动语音识别方法，在科学演示场景中显著提升了识别准确率，特别是针对领域特定术语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA ASR系统主要依赖声学信息而忽略多模态上下文，但视觉信息对于消歧和适应至关重要。特别是在科学演示场景中，演示文稿幻灯片包含重要的上下文信息。

Method: 创建多模态演示基准，开发自动分析领域特定术语转录的方法；探索用多模态信息增强语音模型的方法；通过数据增强解决缺乏配套幻灯片数据集的问题；使用增强数据集训练模型。

Result: 相比基线模型，在所有词汇上实现了约34%的相对词错误率降低，在领域特定术语上实现了35%的相对词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 集成演示文稿幻灯片等视觉信息可以显著提升ASR系统性能，特别是在处理领域特定术语时效果更明显，证明了多模态方法在科学演示场景中的有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多目标马尔可夫决策过程的共识声明生成框架，通过社会选择理论确保公平性，包括两种方法：保证核心稳定性的随机生成策略和最大化平等福利的搜索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏提供可证明公平性保证的结构，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时确保公平性。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级别的马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个智能体的偏好。提出两种基于社会选择理论的方法：保证核心稳定性的随机生成策略和最大化平等福利的搜索算法。

Result: 实验表明，基于平等福利目标的搜索算法生成的共识声明在智能体对齐方面优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了具有可证明公平性保证的结构化方法，能够有效聚合多样化意见并确保公平性。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的多智能体系统虽然能自动化用户任务，但引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意方攻击、智能体被攻陷和数据窃取等安全问题。

Method: 重新利用黑板设计（早期多智能体系统方法），创建模块化、可配置的多智能体协作测试平台，识别关键攻击向量并实现三个协作场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，能够灵活演示多智能体系统中的各种攻击场景，为防御措施和设计迭代提供工具支持。

Conclusion: Terrarium框架通过提供快速原型开发、评估和迭代工具，旨在加速可信多智能体系统的进展，提升系统的安全性、隐私性和安全性。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著超越MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务上的挑战，以及多智能体系统存在的高推理成本、长延迟和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: IMAGINE框架通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型进行训练。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，训练后的模型达到82.7%最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功将多智能体系统的优势集成到单一模型中，显著提升了推理规划能力，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ColorBench，一种图结构基准框架，用于评估移动设备上多模态大语言模型的复杂长时程任务处理能力，解决了现有离线静态基准和在线动态测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理评估标准存在不足：离线静态基准只能验证单一预定义路径，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可重现性，无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过建模真实设备交互中的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟，开发了ColorBench基准，支持多有效解决方案评估、子任务完成率统计和原子级能力分析。

Result: ColorBench包含175个任务（74个单应用，101个跨应用），平均长度超过13步，每个任务至少包含两条正确路径和若干典型错误路径，实现了准动态交互。

Conclusion: 通过在不同基线模型上评估ColorBench，发现了现有模型的局限性，并基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以增强代理在复杂长时程问题上的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

TL;DR: TITAN是一个连接自然语言网络威胁查询与结构化知识图谱可执行推理的框架，包含路径规划模型和图执行器，支持在威胁、行为和防御之间进行清晰可逆的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法有效处理网络威胁情报的自然语言查询与结构化知识之间的连接，需要一种能够执行确定性推理的自动化系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测文本中的逻辑关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体知识图谱，基于MITRE构建的双向类型化图谱支持可逆推理。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能够生成语法有效、语义连贯且可在底层图谱上确定性执行的推理路径。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询与结构化知识图谱的可执行推理连接，为网络威胁情报分析提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和程序发现方面取得进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换，通过单次连续参数加权所有可达路径得到覆盖生成函数，从而诱导可达性难度度量，并提供安全包络诱导图上的几何解释。

Result: 提供了最简单的可测试推断，并通过多数投票实例进行验证，该理论为测量智能体及其搜索空间提供了可操作的语言和工具。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统化的形式化描述框架，能够有效衡量智能体和搜索空间特性。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Result: 在AIME2025上准确率提升15.3%，证明该方法比生成式验证更有效且高效

Conclusion: 预算感知的判别式验证是实际应用中比生成式技术更优越的选择，是自一致性方法的免费升级

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立康德理性自我限制理论与反馈控制理论之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和减少推理系统中的过度自信提供原则性框架。

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指标H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证。

Result: 在模拟中H-Risk能预测过度自信错误；在LLMs中脆弱内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解推理系统的过度自信提供了新视角，揭示了名义稳定性与认知稳定性之间的差距，未来需要更多实验验证。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Result: 在超过30,000个超声心动图视频上验证，无需目标域标签即可超越标准域适应技术。

Conclusion: RL4Seg3D框架有效提高了分割精度、解剖有效性和时间一致性，并提供了稳健的不确定性估计器，可在测试时进一步优化分割性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于乳腺密度的多模态AI框架，结合乳腺X线摄影和热成像技术，根据乳腺组织密度动态选择最佳成像模式，显著提高了乳腺癌检测的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统乳腺X线摄影在致密乳腺组织中的敏感性较低，导致漏诊或延迟诊断。需要开发能够补充乳腺X线结构数据的功能性成像方法。

Method: 324名女性同时接受乳腺X线摄影和热成像检查。使用多视角深度学习模型分析乳腺X线图像，通过血管和热放射组学分析热图像。根据乳腺密度动态选择最佳AI模型：致密乳腺使用Thermalytix AI，脂肪乳腺使用乳腺X线AI。

Result: 多模态AI框架敏感性达94.55%，特异性79.93%，优于单独使用乳腺X线AI（敏感性81.82%，特异性86.25%）和Thermalytix AI（敏感性92.73%，特异性75.46%）。乳腺X线在致密乳腺中的敏感性显著下降至67.86%，而Thermalytix AI在两种乳腺类型中均保持高敏感性（92.59%和92.86%）。

Conclusion: 基于密度的多模态AI框架能够克服单模态筛查的关键限制，在不同乳腺组成中提供高性能检测。该框架具有可解释性、低成本且易于部署，为改善乳腺癌筛查结果提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
(sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
(92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
high-resource and resource-limited settings.
