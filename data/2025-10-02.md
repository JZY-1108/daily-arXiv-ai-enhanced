### [1] [Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125)
*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化（DTO）的自包含机器学习遗忘方法，通过直接优化令牌级目标，无需外部资源即可实现大型语言模型的有效遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘方法通常依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这在实践中不切实际且可能引入额外隐私风险。

Method: 识别待遗忘序列中的目标令牌（用于优化遗忘目标）和非目标令牌（用于保持模型效用），直接优化令牌级目标。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO相比最新基线方法在遗忘质量上提升了最高16.8倍，同时保持了可比的模型效用水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效的自包含遗忘方法，无需外部资源即可实现高质量的机器学习遗忘，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

### [2] [TAMA: Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent for Procedural Activity Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00161)
*Kimihiro Hasegawa,Wiradee Imrattanatrai,Masaki Asada,Ken Fukuda,Teruko Mitamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TAMA框架，一种工具增强的多模态代理，用于过程性活动理解，通过多媒体返回工具实现训练免费的多模态推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程性活动助手在日常生活和专业场景中有广泛应用潜力，但相关系统开发仍处于探索不足状态

Method: 使用多媒体返回工具进行交错多模态推理，在训练免费设置下实现灵活工具选择的代理框架

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly数据集上提升了视觉语言模型的性能，特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL模型

Conclusion: 该框架促进了视频和多模态任务的图像思维范式，推动了过程性活动助手的开发

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

### [3] [DRBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Enterprise Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00172)
*Amirhossein Abaskohi,Tianyi Chen,Miguel Muñoz-Mármol,Curtis Fox,Amrutha Varshini Ramesh,Étienne Marcotte,Xing Han Lù,Nicolas Chapados,Spandana Gella,Christopher Pal,Alexandre Drouin,Issam H. Laradji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRBench是一个用于评估AI代理在复杂、开放式深度研究任务中的表现的基准测试，特别针对企业环境设计。它包含15个跨10个领域的深度研究任务，评估代理在异构搜索空间中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注简单问题或仅限网络查询，缺乏对企业环境中复杂、多步骤深度研究任务的评估能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流程生成任务，结合人工验证。任务基于真实用户角色和企业背景，涵盖生产力软件、云文件系统、邮件、聊天记录和开放网络等异构搜索空间。

Result: 评估了基于GPT、Llama和Qwen等开源和闭源模型的多种深度研究代理，揭示了它们的优势和弱点。

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

### [4] [PrimeX: A Dataset of Worldview, Opinion, and Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00174)
*Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Brihi Joshi,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrimeX数据集包含858名美国居民的公众意见调查数据，附带信念解释和世界观评估，用于研究语言模型如何利用个人信念系统进行个性化改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地向模型表示个体用户。研究探索语言模型是否能利用个体信念系统的某些方面来改进对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，包含公众意见调查数据、受访者书面解释和Primal World Belief世界观调查，进行广泛的数据分析。

Result: 展示了信念解释和世界观信息在个性化语言模型中的价值，证明额外信念信息对NLP和心理学研究社区都有益处。

Conclusion: PrimeX中的额外信念信息为NLP和心理学研究开辟了进一步研究的途径，有助于语言模型的个性化改进。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

### [5] [Personalized Reasoning: Just-In-Time Personalization and Why LLMs Fail At It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00177)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Avinandan Bose,Faeze Brahman,Simon Shaolei Du,Pang Wei Koh,Maryam Fazel,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估方法论，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，使用基于心理学的角色和稀疏偏好来评估LLM的个性化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐视为独立挑战，但在面向人类的应用中，正确解决问题不足够，还需要匹配用户需求。这在冷启动或隐私约束下尤其困难。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估框架，使用心理学基础的角色和稀疏偏好创建场景，其中相同问题需要根据不同用户上下文采用不同推理链。

Result: 评估21个前沿模型在10个任务上的表现，发现29.0%的简单个性化尝试比通用响应更差，而通用响应也无法有效服务个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，不会自然涌现。PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLM交互能力的根本限制。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

### [6] [BiasFreeBench: a Benchmark for Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00232)
*Xin Xu,Xunzhi He,Churan Zhi,Ruizhe Chen,Julian McAuley,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了BiasFreeBench基准测试，用于统一评估LLM去偏方法的性能，解决了现有研究评估不一致和与现实使用场景脱节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去偏方法使用不同的基线和指标进行评估，导致比较不一致，且评估主要基于模型概率而非实际用户交互场景。

Method: 构建BiasFreeBench基准，整合8种主流去偏方法（4种提示方法和4种训练方法），在两种测试场景（多选QA和开放式多轮QA）下统一评估，并引入Bias-Free Score响应级指标。

Result: 系统地比较了提示与训练范式、模型大小以及不同训练策略对未见偏见的泛化能力等关键维度的去偏性能。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在为偏见缓解研究建立统一的测试平台，并将公开发布。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

### [7] [TASER: Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00255)
*Monishwaran Maheswaran,Marco Carini,Christian Federmann,Tony Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASER是一种基于大型推理模型的自动翻译质量评估指标，通过系统化逐步推理来评估翻译质量，在WMT24指标共享任务中取得了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度，需要开发结合准确性和透明度的新评估方法。

Method: 利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力，采用结构化提示模板进行系统化逐步评估，评估了OpenAI的o3模型在不同推理深度下的表现。

Result: 在系统级评估中，TASER在有参考和无参考设置下均达到最高的软配对准确率；在段落级评估中，无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，将改进的准确性与跨不同语言对的透明评估相结合。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a
measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved
accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electrocardiogram-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00261)
*Xiaoyu Song,William Han,Tony Chen,Chaojing Duan,Michael A. Rosenberg,Emerson Liu,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于心电图文生成模型(ELMs)的开源检索增强生成(RAG)管道，通过实验验证RAG能持续提升ELMs在自然语言生成任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对ELMs的RAG实现和系统研究，而RAG在大型语言模型中已被证明能减少幻觉并改善自然语言生成质量。

Method: 开发了开源RAG管道，包括检索模块和生成模块，并在三个公共数据集上进行基线测试和消融研究。

Result: 实验表明，配备RAG的ELMs在性能上持续优于非RAG基线模型，并揭示了关键的ELM设计考量。

Conclusion: RAG是提升ELMs性能的有效方法，开源实现为后续研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种校准概率自动评分器的方法，使其能够建模目标人群的完整偏好分布，解决了传统方法在主观、模糊或细微任务中强制单一标准的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自动评分器存在根本性问题：它们基于离散偏好标签训练，强制将单一标准应用于主观、模糊或细微的任务，限制了可靠性。

Method: 提出了两种学习方法：1）针对密集概率标签的直接监督微调；2）针对稀疏二元标签的强化学习方法，通过分布匹配目标来微调自动评分器。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用分布匹配目标微调的自动评分器能够产生与目标偏好分布更好对齐的言语化概率预测，具有改进的校准度和显著降低的位置偏差，同时在客观任务上保持性能。

Conclusion: 通过校准概率自动评分器以建模完整偏好分布，可以显著提高其在主观任务中的可靠性和校准度，同时减少位置偏差。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

### [10] [Efficient Layer-wise LLM Fine-tuning for Revision Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00268)
*Zhexiong Liu,Diane Litman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IR-Tuning：一种基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要LLM层进行参数高效微调的框架，用于解决文本修订分类任务中标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类特别是需要细微区分的修订分类任务中表现不佳。由于修订标注数据极其昂贵且稀缺，需要开发参数高效的微调方法。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，通过梯度范数分布动态选择重要的LLM层进行微调，同时冻结冗余层，实现参数高效的层级微调。

Result: 实验表明IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务上优于其他层级PEFT基线方法，具有快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和在小型修订语料上的有效性。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在数据稀缺的文本分类任务中提供了一种有效的参数高效微调解决方案，特别适用于需要细微文本区分的任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

### [11] [SafePassage: High-Fidelity Information Extraction with Black Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00276)
*Joe Barrow,Raj Patel,Misha Kharkovski,Ben Davies,Ryan Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafePassage是一个三阶段管道，通过生成安全段落来减少LLM在信息抽取中的幻觉问题，可将幻觉减少高达85%，并能用于评估LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒大语言模型使信息抽取易于配置但难以信任，抽取的信息可能不基于文档内容。需要确保抽取信息在文档中有依据。

Method: 三阶段管道：1）LLM提取器生成结构化实体及其上下文；2）基于字符串的全局对齐器；3）评分模型。使用微调的transformer编码器进行评分。

Result: 将幻觉减少高达85%，在信息抽取任务中误报非幻觉的风险最小。与人类判断高度一致，可用于评估LLM。微调的transformer编码器在标记不安全段落方面优于LLM评分模型。

Conclusion: SafePassage能有效减少LLM在信息抽取中的幻觉问题，且注释收集仅需1-2小时，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

*Ruochen Li,Jun Li,Bailiang Jian,Kun Yuan,Youxiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个临床基础的元评估框架，重新思考放射学报告自动生成评估指标的设计，揭示现有指标在临床语义理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告在现有评估指标上得分很高，但无法获得临床医生的信任，这表明当前评估指标在衡量生成报告质量方面存在根本性缺陷。

Method: 定义临床基础的标准，涵盖临床对齐和关键指标能力（包括区分性、鲁棒性和单调性），使用细粒度标注的数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 发现现有指标在解释临床语义方面存在局限性：无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变化、在错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供了指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

TL;DR: o-mega是一个超参数优化工具，用于在语义匹配领域自动识别最有效的可解释AI方法及其配置，提升自动化事实核查系统的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的语言模型在NLP领域带来革命性进步，但同时也引入了模型透明度和可信度的重大挑战。现有解释方法和评估指标繁多，选择最优可解释性方法面临困难。

Method: 开发o-mega超参数优化工具，在社交媒体帖子与反驳声明配对的精选数据集上，系统探索不同的可解释方法及其超参数。

Conclusion: 这种解释方法的自动优化可以显著提高关键应用（如错误信息检测）中声明匹配模型的可解释性，有助于构建更可信和透明的AI系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

### [14] [CORTEX: Collaborative LLM Agents for High-Stakes Alert Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00311)
*Bowen Wei,Yuan Shen Tay,Howard Liu,Jinhao Pan,Kun Luo,Ziwei Zhu,Chris Jordan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个多智能体LLM架构，用于安全运营中心的高风险警报分类，通过专门智能体协作分析真实证据，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心每天面临数万条警报，只有少量是真实攻击，导致警报疲劳、威胁遗漏和分析师倦怠。传统检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，而单模型LLM方法难以处理嘈杂的企业数据且透明度有限。

Method: 提出CORTEX多智能体LLM架构：行为分析智能体检查活动序列，证据收集智能体查询外部系统，推理智能体将发现综合为可审计的决策。

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM显著减少了误报并提高了调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法比单模型方法更适合处理复杂的安全警报分类任务，提供了更好的透明度和准确性。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC

### [15] [TokMem: Tokenized Procedural Memory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00444)
*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种标记化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑可训练的嵌入，通过记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号，实现恒定大小的目标行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型过度依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，这种方式效率低下，需要每一步重新读取提示，跨任务扩展性差，缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem作为标记化程序记忆，保持骨干模型冻结，允许添加新程序而不干扰现有程序，每个记忆令牌编码程序地址和控制信号。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用组合回忆任务上，TokMem持续优于检索增强生成，避免了重复上下文开销，且参数远少于微调。

Conclusion: TokMem为LLMs提供了可扩展和模块化的程序记忆替代方案，是提示工程和微调的有效替代方法。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

*Yuling Shi,Yichun Qian,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专门为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比，解决了长上下文代码生成中的高成本和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM需要在代码库中处理大量信息，长上下文代码生成变得日益重要。现有上下文剪枝技术如LLMLingua虽然对通用文本有效，但忽视了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，导致在编程任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，使用条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，仅保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留的函数基于困惑度分段，并在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、总结和问答等多个任务上的评估表明，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: 通过有效减小上下文大小同时保留关键信息，LongCodeZip使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

*Koki Ryu,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中的表现，发现用户评论能显著提升LLM的评分预测性能，性能可与传统矩阵分解方法相媲美，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而忽略了需要语言和数学推理的Likert量表评分预测任务。该任务具有重要工业应用价值，但现成LLM在此任务上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过在三个数据集上对八个模型进行综合实验，提供不同的上下文信息，包括用户评论和偏好描述，并尝试让LLM先生成假设性评论再预测评分。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提升了LLM的评分预测性能，性能与传统矩阵分解方法相当；具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效；让LLM先生成假设性评论能进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 现成LLM在评分预测任务中表现出色，特别是结合用户评论时，为解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理LLMs主要通过上下文学习实现多步推理，但存在输入冗长和计算成本高的问题。代理微调能够通过训练让LLMs内化程序性推理和领域知识，但在专业技术微领域的效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用JP1特定数据集（来自领域手册和LLM生成的推理轨迹）对LLMs进行微调，推理时采用检索增强生成和上下文-答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法相比基础模型实现了14%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 代理微调在复杂微领域中具有显著潜力，能够有效提升领域特定推理能力。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI多模态代理在复杂或跨域任务中可靠性有限，需要探究其是否进行伪推理。

Method: 提出Agent-ScanKit框架，包含视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种探测范式，量化记忆和推理贡献，无需访问模型内部。

Result: 在5个公开GUI基准测试中，18个多模态代理的结果显示机械记忆通常优于系统推理，模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 强调了现实场景中多模态代理需要强大的推理建模，为开发可靠多模态代理提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: MOSS-Speech是一个真正的语音到语音大语言模型，直接理解和生成语音，无需依赖文本中介，实现了端到端的语音交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音对话系统采用级联流水线设计，会丢弃副语言线索并限制表达性。现有的端到端方法虽然降低了延迟并更好地保留了这些线索，但仍依赖文本中介，形成了根本性瓶颈。

Method: 结合基于模态的层分割架构和冻结预训练策略，在保持预训练文本LLM推理能力和知识的同时，添加原生语音能力。

Result: 模型在口语问答任务中达到最先进结果，在语音到语音性能上与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持有竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导和直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，以全面评估智能代理的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态LLM驱动的智能代理在自主性和泛化能力上的进步，基于静态数据集的评估已无法充分评估其在动态环境和多样化任务中的真实能力。现有LLM合成数据方法主要针对LLM训练和评估设计，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的代理任务。

Method: 基于多源外部数据构建知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务。采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道来保证生成任务的质量和可执行性。

Result: 实例化为Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景的任务。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分代理和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互能力的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为智能代理评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多种代理类型（单代理、多代理、网页代理）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，提高LLM在RAG中的上下文忠实度，显著减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG中LLM不信任提供上下文导致的幻觉问题，发现高复制度响应与低幻觉率相关。

Method: 设计三种提示方法增强复制度，通过全自动管道将生成响应转化为高复制偏好数据训练模型。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上表现最佳，FaithEval准确率提升12.2%-24.5%，仅需365个训练样本。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识，有效提升上下文忠实度。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,
and procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and
multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and
adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

Method: 开发了包含媒体检索和两阶段对齐算法的流水线，能够处理非逐字记录和长音频，从22个欧洲议会录音中提取对齐语音片段。

Result: 提取了61k+小时的语音数据，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时；在现有ASR模型上微调后，词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够有效构建大规模多语言语音数据集，显著提升语音识别性能，为解决语言数据不平衡问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

TL;DR: 研究发现传统的负对数似然(NLL)目标在监督微调中表现有限，提出基于概率的目标家族，发现模型能力连续体是决定目标效果的关键维度，在模型能力强时偏向先验的目标表现更好，模型弱时NLL占优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)的标准方法负对数似然(NLL)在泛化能力上表现有限，作者认为这是因为后训练阶段与从头训练不同，模型已具备任务相关先验且监督信号可能冗长嘈杂，NLL的最优性假设可能不成立。

Method: 研究基于概率的目标函数家族，通过7个模型主干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验和消融研究，分析不同条件下目标函数的有效性，重点关注模型能力连续体这一关键维度。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标行为的关键：在模型能力强的一端，偏向先验的目标(如$-p$, $-p^{10}$等)持续优于NLL；在模型弱的一端，NLL占主导；中间区域没有单一目标占优。理论分析阐明了目标在连续体上的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 为适应模型能力调整目标函数提供了理论基础，表明应根据模型在能力连续体上的位置选择合适的目标函数，而不是固定使用NLL。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is
available at https://github.com/GaotangLi/Beyond-Log-Likelihood.

TL;DR: GUI-KV是一种即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，专门针对GUI代理设计，通过空间显著性和时间冗余评分技术，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>

Motivation: GUI代理在处理高分辨率截图和长序列任务时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未能充分利用GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合空间显著性指导（通过隐藏状态L2范数增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（将历史帧键投影到当前帧键子空间），采用统一的预算分配策略。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV在AgentNetBench基准上减少38.9%的解码FLOPs，同时将步骤准确率提高4.1%。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定的冗余特性可以实现高效可靠的代理性能，简单的统一预算分配策略优于复杂的层变方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用时存在过度思考问题，导致正确结果被后续推理覆盖。现有简洁推理研究主要针对数学领域，工具推理领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ThinkBrake训练无关的解码启发式方法：在句子边界监控</think>与当前top token的对数概率边际，当边际变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard的单轮、非实时和实时测试中，ThinkBrake保持或提升准确率的同时减少最多25%的token使用，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: ThinkBrake有效解决了小推理模型的过度思考问题，在工具使用场景中实现了更高效的推理，为工具推理领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various

TL;DR: 提出了CHIME数据集，用于评估大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力，发现LLMs在解释文化背景复杂的流行语和追溯起源方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解在互联网上快速传播的病毒性内容——特别是中文网络流行语。

Method: 构建CHIME数据集，包含中文网络流行语及其详细注释；设计两个评估任务：解释流行语含义和选择合适流行语填空。

Result: LLMs能解释部分流行语含义，但对文化和语言细微差别的流行语表现显著下降；在追溯起源方面持续困难；在选择题任务中表现低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解仍有限，特别是在文化背景和起源方面；CHIME数据集将促进计算性流行语理解的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Yifan Wang,Peiming Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReSeek是一个用于训练搜索代理的自我纠正框架，通过引入JUDGE动作和密集的过程奖励函数，使代理能够在搜索过程中动态识别和纠正错误路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的搜索代理方法依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，导致代理容易陷入次优或错误的推理路径而无法恢复。

Method: 提出ReSeek框架，包含自我纠正机制和密集的过程奖励函数（正确性奖励和实用性奖励），并引入新的基准数据集FictionalHot。

Result: 实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自我纠正机制和密集奖励设计，有效提升了搜索代理在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoT Vectors方法，通过紧凑向量表示编码多步推理知识，解决现有CoT方法成本高、效率低的问题，在减少可训练参数的同时达到与参数高效微调方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法（如上下文学习和微调）成本高昂且效率低下，需要开发更经济高效的CoT推理增强方法。

Method: 提出CoT Vectors：1）从提取的CoT Vectors观察到层间不稳定性问题；2）提出可学习的CoT Vectors，在教师-学生框架下优化以提供更稳定和鲁棒的指导。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的广泛评估表明，CoT Vectors不仅优于现有基线方法，而且达到与参数高效微调方法相当的性能，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors不仅是一种有效的推理增强方法，还可作为探针揭示LLM中多步推理的功能组织，包括潜在空间结构、信息密度、获取机制和预训练差异等因素的影响。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Method: 集成基于可学习查询的架构与多语言感知，通过大规模模拟代码切换数据进行预训练。

Result: 在多个语言分离基准测试中达到最先进性能，相对性能提升23%至52%。

Conclusion: 不仅推进了语言分离研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

TL;DR: 本文为低资源语言Tenyidie创建了10,120个音节化词汇数据集，并应用多种深度学习模型进行音节化任务，其中BLSTM模型在测试集上取得了99.21%的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie作为那加兰邦的主要语言，是一种低资源的藏缅语系语言，目前尚未有关于其音节化的研究。音节化是NLP中的重要任务，对形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等应用至关重要。

Method: 创建了10,120个音节化Tenyidie词汇的数据集，应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和编码器-解码器四种深度学习架构，数据集按80:10:10的比例划分为训练集、验证集和测试集。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节化任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言的NLP研究提供了重要的数据集和基准结果，将有助于该语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等后续NLP应用的发展。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MCM-DPO方法改进替代文本生成，通过多维度偏好学习解决用户标注噪声问题，在Twitter和Pinterest数据上验证效果优于DPO和SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前替代文本生成面临用户标注噪声、标准不一致和MLLM对上下文信息不敏感的问题，传统SFT方法依赖准确标注但用户生成数据往往存在缺陷。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在单维度、配对和多偏好维度上优化文本、视觉和跨模态因素，无需精确标注即可学习偏好对中的更好选项。

Result: 实验结果显示MCM-DPO在替代文本生成任务上持续优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MCM-DPO通过多维度偏好学习有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，构建的高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt为后续研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大型语言模型自动生成易读文本的方法，提出了多任务学习框架，结合文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成任务，在Mistral-7B和LLaMA-3-8B模型上验证了多任务方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化复杂文本对于确保信息公平获取至关重要，特别是对认知障碍人群。易读文本的手动创建耗时耗力，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和ETR生成任务。探索了两种策略：基于检索增强生成的多任务RAG和参数高效微调的MTL-LoRA。

Result: 实验表明多任务设置在所有配置下都优于单任务基线。RAG策略在域外设置中具有泛化能力，而MTL-LoRA在域内配置中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架能有效提升易读文本的自动生成质量，为信息可访问性提供了实用的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: AI驱动的易读文本生成提供了可扩展的解决方案，预训练语言模型在易读文本生成任务中表现出色，能够有效解决可访问性问题。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

TL;DR: ALARB是一个专门评估阿拉伯语大语言模型在法律领域推理能力的数据集和任务套件，包含13K+沙特商业法庭案例，涵盖事实、法庭推理、判决和引用条款，用于评估判决预测、推理链补全等复杂法律推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准主要关注检索和理解任务，缺乏专门针对多步推理的数据集，特别是在开放语境下的阿拉伯语LLM推理能力评估。

Method: 构建包含13K+沙特商业法庭案例的数据集，定义判决预测、推理链补全、相关法规识别等任务，并对代表性阿拉伯语LLM进行基准测试和指令微调。

Result: 使用ALARB对12B参数模型进行指令微调后，在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成任务中表现显著提升，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效提升了阿拉伯语LLM在法律领域的推理能力，证明了其在复杂法律推理任务中的实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 该研究探索如何将小型高效LLM适配到法罗语这种低资源北日耳曼语言。通过从英语模型出发，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练，然后对法罗语进行微调，比较了全参数微调和LoRA参数高效微调方法。


<details>

Motivation: 法罗语是一种低资源语言，缺乏现有的评估数据。研究旨在探索如何有效利用相关语言资源来提升法罗语的语言模型性能。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上进行继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调。比较了全参数微调和LoRA方法，并构建了两个新的最小对基准数据集，辅以法罗语语言学家的专家评估。

Result: 相关语言的迁移学习至关重要，但最佳源语言取决于任务：冰岛语提升语言准确性，丹麦语增强理解能力。LoRA在语言可接受性和人类评估方面表现更好，而全参数微调在理解能力和下游任务微调中表现更强。

Conclusion: 语言适配策略需要根据具体任务选择：源语言选择和微调方法都应根据目标任务进行优化，没有单一的最佳方案。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决检索增强LLM机器翻译在真实世界噪声检索环境下的可靠性问题，当前对此缺乏系统性理解。

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新评估指标，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和大型推理模型）在不同资源水平的语言对上进行习语翻译测试。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下性能下降更严重，常产生无意义翻译；大型推理模型在纠错方面无改进，反而更易受噪声影响；注意力从源习语转向噪声内容，置信度增加但准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要在干净上下文性能和噪声鲁棒性之间权衡，迫切需要自验证集成机制。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注有害内容生成，但忽略了当操作目标与人类安全冲突时，代理可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实现操作目标的有害行动与导致较差操作性能的安全行动之间做出选择，并设置平行控制组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全-实用权衡方面表现不佳：许多模型为推进操作目标而选择有害选项，而其他模型则过于安全而变得无效。模型能够感知危害但存在优先级排序问题。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估代理行为核心组成部分的具有挑战性的基准：当操作目标和对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM在复杂多跳推理中可靠性有限，主要面临分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误三大挑战，任一环节的失败都会导致最终答案错误

Method: 提出可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，能够明确识别错误步骤、擦除错误推理并重新生成，防止错误逻辑在推理链中传播

Result: 在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle等数据集上取得显著提升，3B模型EM提升8.48%、F1提升11.56%，7B模型EM提升5.38%、F1提升7.22%，超越之前SOTA结果

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLM中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的基础和幻觉声明，以及使用几率比偏好优化的偏好微调方法，将大型模型的推理能力蒸馏到较小的骨干网络中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与更大的专门模型相当；在整个基准测试中达到75.7%的平衡准确率，与GPT-4o等大型通用LLM相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的训练方法和数据策略，可以在较小模型规模下有效解决RAG系统中的幻觉问题，为构建可信的AI系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

*Zhen Yin,Shenghua Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测学术文本中AI生成内容的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现了跨领域的鲁棒性检测，并在新构建的跨学科数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在科学写作中的快速应用，引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧。现有检测方法主要依赖文档级分类或表面统计线索，但忽视了细粒度的片段定位，校准能力弱，且难以跨学科和生成器泛化。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多层次对比学习来捕捉细微的人机差异并减轻主题依赖性；集成BIO-CRF序列标注与基于指针的边界解码和置信度校准，实现精确的片段级检测和可靠的概率估计。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的新建跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet实现了最先进的性能：AI-F1为80.17，AUROC为92.63，Span-F1为74.36。在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，并在IMRaD章节和不同学科间保持平衡的准确性。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet通过结构感知的方法有效解决了AI生成学术文本检测的挑战，显著超越了现有基线方法。为确保可复现性并促进该领域研究，数据集和源代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文研究了检索增强生成（RAG）在解决奥林匹克物理问题中的应用，提出了PhoPile多模态数据集，并评估了RAG在提升基础模型物理推理能力方面的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG与基础模型在多种任务中表现出色，但在专家级推理（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）方面的能力尚未充分探索。受学生通过复习过往问题准备竞赛的启发，研究RAG增强物理推理的潜力。

Method: 引入PhoPile高质量多模态数据集，专门针对奥林匹克级物理问题设计，包含图表、图形和方程。使用PhoPile对RAG增强的基础模型进行基准测试，涵盖大型语言模型（LLMs）和大型多模态模型（LMMs），并采用多种检索器。

Result: 结果表明，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提高模型性能，同时也凸显了在检索增强物理推理方面需要进一步研究的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG在提升基础模型物理推理能力方面具有潜力，但仍有挑战需要解决，为检索增强物理推理的进一步研究提供了动机。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fusion-of-N (FusioN) 是一种协作式方法，使用LLM法官将多个候选样本中最有价值的信息融合成单一最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N选择方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Best-of-N方法本质上是零和的，会丢弃池中多样且有潜在价值的信息。作者希望探索协作设置，让所有候选样本都能为最终生成结果做出贡献。

Method: 提出Fusion-of-N方法，使用通用LLM法官来合成每个样本中最具信息量的元素，形成单一最终答案。在两种设置下进行比较：测试时扩展（从单一模型采样聚合）和合成数据生成（融合多样化教师池的样本来改进学生模型）。

Result: 在11种语言、3种多样化任务和不同模型规模上的广泛基准测试中，FusioN始终优于BoN，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游增益方面都表现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量度量转向接受LLM生成的多面性本质，通过整合多样化优势、解锁潜在潜力，实现仅靠选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时的性能下降问题，特别是语法差异对问答任务准确性的影响。

Method: 通过将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多项选择问答任务上测试LLM性能，并调查语法规则对性能下降的具体影响。

Result: 非标准英语问题导致准确率下降高达20%，其中三个语法规则（存在性"it"、零系词和y'all）解释了多数方言中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注针对个别高影响语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种语法引导的扩散语言模型，通过结构监督和个性化条件来增强文本质量、多样性和可控性，解决了传统语言模型输出过于通用化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型的发展为超越自回归范式提供了新的机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法指导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以实现结构与内容的更好对齐。通过共享表示机制实现细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优越性。定性分析突出了其在学习个性化模式方面的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的语法引导扩散语言模型通过整合结构监督和个性化条件，显著提升了文本生成的质量、多样性和可控性，为个性化文本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合对话状态跟踪模型，结合规则方法和语言模型，在波斯语多轮对话数据集上显著提升了准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法为复杂对话提供所需的适应性和连贯性，无法实现类似人类的体验。

Method: 使用混合DST模型，包括BERT进行槽位填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，以及在线代理进行实时答案生成。

Result: 在波斯语多轮对话数据集上评估，相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为构建更定制化、适应性更强、更接近人类的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

Motivation: 非洲拥有2000多种语言，但在ASR研究中代表性严重不足，这阻碍了非洲大陆的数字包容性发展。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020程序，检索DBLP、ACM Digital Library等数据库2020-2025年的研究，筛选出71项研究进行分析。

Result: 共记录了74个数据集，涵盖111种语言，约11,206小时语音数据。仅不到15%的研究提供可复现材料，数据集许可不清晰。自监督和迁移学习有前景但受限于数据不足。

Conclusion: 未来可持续发展需要利益相关者合作、创建伦理平衡的数据集、使用轻量级建模技术和积极基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in

performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

TL;DR: MASH是一个训练框架，通过强化学习让LLM学会选择性求助外部工具，从而间接实现拒绝回答超出知识边界的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM无法可靠识别自身知识边界，经常对超出边界的问题产生幻觉回答。相比之下，人类能够识别自身局限并寻求外部帮助或拒绝回答。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，让LLM学会在需要时寻求外部帮助，同时奖励回答准确性。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法；在多跳数据集上，答案准确率提高了7.6%。MASH还能区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，可成功用于做出拒绝回答决策，且无需预先确定知识边界来构建训练数据。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型及其多模态扩展的普及，通过级联领域特定编码器与LLM实现多模态的方法存在安全漏洞，使模型继承所有组件的脆弱性。

Method: 对语音语言模型进行音频后门攻击，在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上测试，涵盖四种任务，并进行组件级分析识别最脆弱环节。

Result: 攻击在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上均有效，成功率在90.76%到99.41%之间，组件分析揭示了后门在模型管道中的传播路径。

Conclusion: 多模态语言模型存在严重的安全漏洞，提出了基于微调的防御方法来缓解预训练编码器中毒的威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在影响人类福祉的高风险决策中发挥越来越重要的作用，需要评估这些模型在分配稀缺社会资源时的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入社会福祉函数基准测试，这是一个动态模拟环境，让LLM作为主权分配者，将任务分配给异质化的接收者群体，在集体效率最大化（投资回报率）和分配公平性（基尼系数）之间建立持久权衡。

Result: 评估了20个最先进的LLM，发现：(i) 模型的通用对话能力与其分配技能相关性差；(ii) 大多数LLM表现出强烈的功利主义倾向，优先考虑群体生产力而忽视严重不平等；(iii) 分配策略高度脆弱，容易受到输出长度约束和社会影响框架的干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和针对性的对齐方法来改进AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能产生不相关的演示，限制了LLM在多样化任务中的效果。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，实现动态演示增强，在预算约束下限制演示和输出的token数量。

Result: 在数学数据集上训练的GRAD在Qwen2.5-14B上持续超越强基线，在数学推理和STEM问题上表现出色，并能有效泛化到物理、化学、计算机科学等OOD领域。

Conclusion: GRAD引入可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境下的动态少样本学习范式迈出第一步，小模型生成的演示能有效指导大模型，降低训练成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现后训练对齐导致LLM多样性下降（模式崩溃）的根本原因是偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的提示策略——言语化采样，能显著提高生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决后训练对齐过程中LLM多样性下降的问题，揭示模式崩溃的数据层面根本原因——认知心理学中的典型性偏见，而非算法限制。

Method: 提出言语化采样（Verbalized Sampling）策略：让模型言语化一组响应的概率分布（如"生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率"），这是一种无需训练的提示方法。

Result: 在创意写作、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成等任务中，VS显著提升性能，创意写作多样性提高1.6-2.1倍，且不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。更强大的模型从VS中获益更多。

Conclusion: 本文提供了模式崩溃的数据中心视角和实用的推理时解决方案，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性潜力。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出SPHERE方法，通过超球面能量正则化来稳定神经元权重分布，解决大语言模型顺序编辑中的性能退化问题，在保持先验知识的同时实现可靠的顺序更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但顺序编辑往往会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。作者希望通过理解并缓解顺序编辑引起的性能退化。

Method: 使用超球面能量量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法：识别与预训练权重矩阵主超球面方向互补的稀疏空间，将新知识投影到该空间，减少对主方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3和Qwen2.5上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时最忠实地保持模型的通用性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一种可靠的大规模知识编辑原则性方法，通过稳定超球面能量来保持先验知识，同时实现可靠的顺序更新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率性能，在保持光谱保真度的同时恢复空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度。

Method: 提出可集成到标准2D卷积架构的SSUF模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，并设计包含空间和光谱梯度分量的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能够有效提升高光谱超分辨率的重建质量，在保持光谱完整性的同时改善空间分辨率。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

Motivation: 大型语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误会在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。现有研究对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，缺乏连贯理解可能导致解决方案只缓解表面症状而非根本原因。

Method: 首先提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，然后使用任务-模态交织方法将这些幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 调查发现幻觉通常源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见，通过加深理解为开发更稳健有效的解决方案奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这项调查通过提供对幻觉的深入理解，为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健和有效的解决方案奠定了基础，有助于解决表面症状而非根本原因的问题。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文针对VLA模型提出RobustVLA方法，通过多模态鲁棒性优化提升模型在动作、指令、环境和观察扰动下的性能，在LIBERO基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要关注视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出RobustVLA方法：1）输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声；2）输入鲁棒性：在保持任务语义的输入变化下强制执行一致动作；3）将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用UCB算法自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA在pi0骨干上获得12.6%绝对增益，在OpenVLA骨干上获得10.4%增益，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在混合扰动下获得10.4%增益。在真实FR5机器人上，四模态扰动下获得65.6%绝对增益。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效提升了VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现出色，为VLA模型的实际部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现内在能力、基于影响力估计的数据归因和平衡选择，仅用5%数据就能超越全数据训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽略了控制学习过程的潜在内在能力，导致数据缩减时性能下降

Method: 无监督发现内在能力→基于梯度学习轨迹进行数据归因→平衡选择和分阶段排序的课程设计

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练效果

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建模块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度递进，缺少跨语言任务，且使用真实世界图像（每张图像通常只包含一种文化），使得测试相对容易。

Method: 构建C³B基准，包含三个难度递进的任务：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成。包含超过2000张图像和18000个问答对。

Result: 对11个开源MLLMs进行评估，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战，鼓励未来研究提升MLLMs的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文分析了六个先进文本到图像模型中的性别偏见，发现在医院相关职业中普遍存在系统性刻板印象：护士均为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型表现各异，提示词修饰语也会显著影响性别平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意领域应用日益广泛，但其输出常常嵌入和放大社会偏见。本研究旨在调查这些模型中的性别表征问题，特别是医院职业中的刻板印象。

Method: 使用六个开源模型生成图像，针对五种医院职业和五种肖像修饰语的组合各生成100张图像，分析性别分布和提示词敏感度。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士均为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型性别偏向程度不同，提示词修饰语（如corporate强化男性，beautiful强化女性）显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见是系统性和模型特定的，提示词措辞对人口统计结果有重要影响，需要偏差感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身存在被窃取的安全风险，目前这一风险尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将模板窃取建模为序列决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，攻击成本降至现有基线的13%以下，能够有效泛化到不同图像风格窃取未见过的提示词模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测驱动因素，这种可信度与忠实性之间的不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：1)获取模型答案和解释；2)解析解释为可测试的视觉概念；3)通过生成式修复进行针对性反事实编辑；4)使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上的测试显示，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT提供了一种自动化验证VLM解释忠实性的方法，能够识别解释中引用的概念在因果测试中失败的情况。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HiDe框架，通过分层解耦方法解决多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像处理中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳是因为感知限制和小物体识别困难，但本文分析发现主要问题其实是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token并识别关键信息token；2）Layout-Preserving Decoupling解耦目标区域与背景，重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，内存使用比之前方法减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升MLLMs性能，证明了背景干扰是影响高分辨率图像理解的关键因素。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频分量以优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双重域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索方法，通过特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程和多LRF技术组合，实现高效压缩且兼容各种卷积层和全连接层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间大、微调时间长、兼容性差等问题，需要更高效的压缩框架。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，一次性微调过程，集成6种LRF技术（卷积层3种、全连接层3种）并分层选择性应用。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著压缩且精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高效的CNN压缩解决方案，兼容TensorFlow 2.x，通过多LRF技术组合和智能秩选择获得更好的压缩效果。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在One-Image Guides（结合文本、图像和符号的视觉格式）的人类化理解能力评估不足，需要专门基准来测试这种为人类感知设计的复杂视觉文本关系理解。

Method: 开发半自动标注流程，多个智能代理协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人工构建图像-文本对，构建OIG-Bench基准，并评估29个最先进的MLLMs。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B在评估模型中表现最佳，总体准确率77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面存在显著弱点，多智能体标注系统在图像描述生成方面优于所有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在准确解释复杂视觉文本关系方面仍面临挑战，多智能体标注系统在图像描述生成和未来数据集构建方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Conclusion: 基于USN的剪枝方法能有效减少神经网络的过参数化问题，同时保持模型表达能力，在对抗语义变换扰动方面提供了更好的鲁棒性认证性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Conclusion: 基于传输理论的SCDT域建模方法为高光谱异常检测提供了有效的解决方案，在复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA适配器的水印框架MOLM，通过密钥激活轻量级适配器来为生成图像嵌入水印，无需重新训练模型，具有良好的不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了对检测合成图像和溯源来源的迫切需求。现有水印方法对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且密钥更新成本高。

Method: 提出通用水印框架，将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥依赖扰动。具体实现MOLM使用路由机制，让二进制密钥激活残差块和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能有效抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击，实现稳健的密钥恢复。

Conclusion: MOLM框架避免了密钥特定的重新训练，实现了水印的不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界目标检测方法存在已知和未知类别间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别精度退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数挖掘与已知对象差异显著的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标函数分离已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别的判别性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别精度提升了2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法，有效解决了开放世界目标检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的ExpDWT-VAE方法通过集成空间和频域特征，成功改善了VAE潜在空间表示，在遥感应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型在实际部署中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将历史特征融入预测解码器。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应现实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

TL;DR: BindWeave是一个统一的框架，用于处理从单主体到复杂多主体场景的主题一致视频生成，通过MLLM-DiT框架实现跨模态推理，在OpenS2V基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在主题一致性方面存在不足，难以解析包含复杂空间关系、时间逻辑和多主体交互的提示词。

Method: 提出BindWeave框架，采用MLLM-DiT架构，使用预训练多模态大语言模型进行深度跨模态推理，识别实体并解耦角色、属性和交互，生成主题感知的隐藏状态来指导扩散变换器。

Result: 在OpenS2V基准测试中，该方法在主题一致性、自然度和文本相关性方面均优于现有开源和商业模型。

Conclusion: BindWeave通过统一的框架有效解决了复杂多主体场景下的主题一致视频生成问题，展示了卓越的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络解决自监督去噪中的高频细节丢失和噪声学习问题，通过频率控制策略优化配对噪声图像的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法在映射配对噪声图像时存在两个问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及网络在学习高频信息时会学习到噪声。

Method: 1. 频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2. 基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化方法限制卷积核对高频噪声的学习；3. 谱分离和低秩重建模块(SSR)通过频域分离和低秩重建分离噪声与高频细节。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制策略成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题，在保持图像质量的同时有效去除噪声。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在领域偏移下性能会下降，需要一种有效的测试时适应方法。

Method: 提出IoU加权的熵目标函数，专注于空间一致的提案聚类；引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序，并将最信息丰富的提示与检测器逻辑融合。

Result: 在多种分布偏移（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试显示，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均优于零样本和TTA基线。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架能有效提升视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的性能，具有一致的改进效果。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出NAGL框架，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可用的异常样本的宝贵信息

Method: NAGL框架包含残差挖掘(RM)提取异常模式，异常特征学习(AFL)自适应学习异常特征

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有GAD方法

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的方法

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，避免不同矩阵产生相同图像表示的问题，在稀疏线性系统求解中实现5.86%-11.50%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的选择方法在特征提取时可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致相同的选择和次优方法选择，需要改进特征提取技术来提高选择准确性。

Method: 提出RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及相应的数值作为绝对特征，获得全面的矩阵表示。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和自建的BMCMat数据集上评估，RAF使稀疏线性系统求解时间减少0.08s-0.29s，比传统图像选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止特征歧义提高了选择准确性，释放了基于图像选择方法的潜力，在稀疏线性系统求解中表现出色。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生成先验的手部姿态优化方法，通过利用手-物体交互的affordance感知文本描述来指导扩散模型，解决严重遮挡下的3D手部姿态重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时，人类会利用上下文知识（如affordance）来解决姿态歧义。受此启发，希望通过affordance感知的文本描述来指导手部姿态优化。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，affordance描述由大型视觉语言模型推断得出，从而优化被遮挡区域的手部姿态。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化方法，显著提升了手部姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化能够显著改善严重遮挡情况下的3D手部姿态重建，生成更准确和功能一致的手部姿态。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Result: 大量实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难，显著提升了多模态大模型的效率。

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用有限，缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准测试套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程，建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供可行见解。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节引起的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且无法进行细化。

Method: 使用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段是联合扩散模型生成多样化的3D关节假设，第二阶段是基于网格潜在扩散模型（Mesh LDM）在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，并有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模和级联细化的优势，解决了3D手部姿态重建中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感害虫检测的关键挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。研究旨在证明在解决新视觉任务时，无需大量标注数据也能获得良好性能。

Method: 收集5000个培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景。对比三种视觉基础模型与传统基线方法，在特定任务指标上进行基准测试。

Result: MaskDINO模型仅用150张图像微调就达到与充分训练的YoloV9模型相近性能，仅用25张图像仍能保持竞争力，在约70%样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分匹配其性能，使自动化微生物系统能够更早开发并更快迭代改进，且具有比传统模型更优的上限性能。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务学习向多任务学习过渡时存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在基于LoRA的MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家通过路由器门控权重联合归一化；增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中知识共享效率低的问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Result: 在2x到32x多尺度帧插值基准测试中，ArbInterp在所有场景下都优于现有方法，具有更高的保真度和更无缝的时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间编码和分段生成策略，成功解决了传统视频帧插值方法在灵活性和可扩展性方面的限制，为视频生成应用提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF提出了一种针对神经辐射场（NeRF）的多层级动态风格迁移方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程并引入动态风格注入模块，在保持场景多尺度空间结构的同时有效传递艺术风格特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息直接集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想，需要专门针对风格化任务重新设计NeRF流程。

Method: 1. 多层级特征适配器生成多层级特征网格表示；2. 动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式；3. 多层级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图；4. 支持使用3D风格参考的全视角风格迁移。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF流程和引入创新的动态风格注入模块，显著提升了3D风格迁移的性能，在内容保持和艺术风格化方面都取得了优异效果。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: ADPT提供了一个可扩展且经济高效的高保真数据集构建解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于共识驱动的在线特征增强策略（COFA），通过交替使用前景和背景特征来提升视觉语言导航（VLN）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉语言导航中，前景区域提供语义线索，背景区域包含空间连接信息，但这两者在视觉观察中的重要性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用语义增强的地标识别来分离前景和背景作为候选增强特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略，让智能体根据不同的指令和导航位置来整合两阶段投票结果。

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上的实验表明，该在线前景-背景增强方法提升了基线的泛化能力，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 前景和背景特征的交替使用能够有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能，该方法在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: RCOR方法通过将定位作为识别的一部分，实现了鲁棒性和上下文感知的联合优化，无需牺牲任何一方，在包含域内和域外背景的数据集上提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息，产生虚假相关性学习，限制了模型在真实部署环境中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦了以对象为中心和上下文感知的建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和视觉语言模型在包含域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，即使不进行微调也能有效工作。在ImageNet-1k等复杂场景中实现了定位先于识别的可能性。

Conclusion: 定位先于识别的方法在复杂场景中变得可行，RCOR为同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知提供了一种有效途径。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

Motivation: 对抗训练是单步生成的关键技术，但GAN训练在实践中难以正确收敛且容易陷入模式崩溃。研究发现输入条件在判别器中创建了冗余捷径，阻碍了有意义的知识提取。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能够有效促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，解决收敛问题和模式崩溃，在单步生成任务中表现出色，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能

Conclusion: 结合几何先验和网络学习过程的创新方法，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估下一代文本到图像模型的概念擦除策略鲁棒性建立了可靠基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于脑部血管分割的领域自适应框架，通过图像到图像翻译技术在不同数据集上有效分割脑动脉和静脉，避免了特定领域模型设计和数据协调的需求。


<details>

Conclusion: 结果突显了该框架的鲁棒性和多功能性，展示了领域自适应方法在多种场景下准确执行脑血管图像分割的潜力。

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法往往忽视图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间的概率分布视为不重要或预定义的。本研究旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间中运行。

Result: 潜在MPPM（LMPPM）在各种数据集上优于潜在扩散模型（LDM），在图像恢复和生成方面取得了更优越的结果。

Conclusion: 通过统一几何和概率视角，本研究为理解扩散模型提供了新的解释框架，并开发出性能更优的确定性生成模型。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但在108个类别的脑部分割任务中，二进制编码方法的分割性能明显低于one-hot编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基于学习的方法通常使用one-hot编码表示类别标签，计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数量线性增长。本文旨在通过二进制编码方法将计算和内存需求降低到类别数量的对数级别。

Method: 提出了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配以及标签嵌入树等方法，应用于基于3D MRI图像的108个类别全脑分割任务。

Result: 与one-hot编码(DSC=82.4)相比，二进制分割方法的分割性能显著下降，DSC范围在39.3到73.8之间，未能达到最先进的分割质量。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在计算机视觉的极端分类问题中已被证明有效，但在大规模多类分割任务中面临挑战。作者希望这项工作能启发未来对紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件-图像知识蒸馏框架，通过CLIP的语义理解实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，结合SNN和CNN的混合架构自适应提取事件特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏纹理和颜色信息，现有事件检测方法局限于预定义类别，难以泛化到新物体。CLIP等视觉语言模型在RGB图像中实现了开放词汇检测，但无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示。设计SNN-CNN混合框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时机，CNN处理提取的特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免了固定分组事件分割方法造成的信息丢失。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架成功弥合了图像和事件流之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，为事件相机在动态环境中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于原型推理的XAI方法通常依赖后处理显著图技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。

Method: 提出ProtoMask模型架构，使用分割掩码的边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为独立输入，限制显著图计算到语义图像块。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，模型具有竞争性性能和独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask通过结合分割基础模型有效提高了原型学习方法的解释真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个推理驱动的框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块增强概念瓶颈模型，在多模态输入中建模概念间的结构化关系，显著提升复杂概念推理的适应性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，忽略了概念间的结构化关系，难以适应高风险领域对可解释性日益增长的需求。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模概念关系，集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖，并用混合专家模块替换前馈层，动态分配推理任务给不同子专家。

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过建模概念结构化关系和利用动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别或长视频中的关键时刻定位，且现有方法依赖复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，通过计算候选视觉输入的响应不确定性得分，使模型能够自主聚焦于最显著的数据，无需额外训练。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务上，该方法使现成的MLLM达到了与专门微调方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Motivation: 传统的基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习替代迭代配准，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关效应，同时对灌注序列和辅助图像进行对齐。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Motivation: 传统情感预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。低成本EEG设备提供了更直接、无偏的数据源，但需要验证其简化测量能力是否足够准确。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情感分类。

Result: 模型仅使用12个测量点（通道）就实现了91.57%的准确率，预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价），相比使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%仅略有下降。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明了低成本EEG设备在情感预测中的可行性，为心理健康、人机交互和情感计算应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程和信息理论驱动的方法，有效解决了极端盲图像恢复问题，无需微调即可增强现有模型。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal

paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning

experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the

Motivation: 当前图像-文本对齐评估缺乏全面基准，现有预测器在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性等方面存在不足，特别是在存在多个有效描述的现实场景中。

Method: 采用即插即用架构，在大型视觉语言模型上构建奖励头，通过轻量级岭回归层对预训练模型的冻结隐藏状态进行训练，生成细粒度的多目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器G-VEval相当但模型更小（7-8B），在多目标基准和新发布的EYE4ALL数据集上优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP提供了一个强大且高效的图像-文本对齐评估解决方案，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征表示来生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在真实场景中适用性有限。

Method: 使用深度神经网络的特征图，将其添加到干净图像中来破坏目标模型的分类性能。

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有方法更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了深度神经网络在真实世界应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒攻击方案。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型虽然提供可解释性，但预测性能通常低于端到端卷积神经网络，且概念预测到最终标签决策的不确定性传播研究不足。

Method: 学习一组二进制类级概念原型，使用预测概念向量与每个类原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，这些原型也作为可解释的分类规则。

Result: 该框架通过基于学习到的二进制类级概念原型的偏差，为不确定或异常输入启用符合预测，增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持概念瓶颈模型可解释性的同时，改善了预测性能并有效处理了不确定性传播问题。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic是一个新颖的评估框架，用于检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的缺陷，通过比较语法不同但语义相同的提示词生成的图像对来识别对齐失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理语义等效但语法不同的提示词时，经常产生语义不一致的图像，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别语义不一致性，无需依赖真实图像作为基准。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估发现，即使是Flux.dev和DALLE-3这样的SOTA模型也分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了模型在逻辑理解方面的严重缺陷。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实基准的评估方法，能够有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，可用于模型调试和改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

TL;DR: ADQA是一个新的音频描述评估基准，用于评估长视频片段的音频描述质量，关注视觉欣赏和叙事理解，发现现有自动生成方法远不如人工创作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成研究主要关注短片段，且评估时只与单一参考对比，忽略了音频描述的主观性本质。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道来量化主观性，提出ADQA基准，在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估音频描述质量。

Result: 量化了音频描述在描述时机、内容和重点方面的主观性，显示当前自动生成方法在视觉欣赏和叙事理解方面远落后于人工创作。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的长视频音频描述生成方法，并建立了公开排行榜用于基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。为了利用立体视觉中的深度信息进行更精确的上下文感知定位，需要将短语定位扩展到立体图像领域。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo从现有单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，构建包含对齐分割掩码和短语标注的立体图像对数据集。

Result: 成功创建了PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，支持模型在语义和几何上进行联合推理。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集填补了立体视觉中短语定位研究的空白，为开发能够同时处理语义和几何信息的模型提供了重要资源，将推动多模态学习在立体视觉领域的发展。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，通过两阶段训练结合自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现高质量、快速且鲁棒的结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么速度慢（基于随机噪声的扩散模型），要么质量低（直接输入低质量图像），且对输入图像质量变化缺乏鲁棒性

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的尺度预测策略，采用两阶段训练：先训练转换网络生成初步尺度，再进行端到端全模型微调

Result: 在定量和定性评估中优于现有方法，保持快速推理速度，对输入图像质量变化具有更高鲁棒性

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了优越的视觉结果和更强的泛化性能

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有层次对比学习方法准确率提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显式建模类间关系和层次间的不平衡类别分布，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Motivation: 随着强大的视频基础模型出现，研究它们是否能够替代传统视觉编码器范式来进行通用多模态理解，特别是系统性地研究生成世界模型在多模态任务中的潜力。

Method: 将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器，执行单步去噪并将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建World-Language Models (WorldLMs)，其中最佳变体称为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)。

Result: DyVA在空间推理能力上显著提升，使单图像模型能够进行多帧推理，在一系列视觉推理任务中超越了开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: WorldLMs继承了视频预训练中的运动一致性内部化特性，为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型家族指明了方向，有望成为通用视觉学习者的有希望路径。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合架构GSMamba，结合了移位窗口自注意力用于空间上下文聚合和基于Mamba的选择性扫描用于高效时间传播，以解决视频超分辨率中的问题。

Motivation: 传统的视频超分辨率方法依赖循环架构，但存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢等问题。虽然Mamba等选择性状态空间模型提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但单独使用Mamba难以捕捉细粒度空间依赖关系。

Method: 提出混合架构：1) 移位窗口自注意力用于空间上下文聚合；2) Mamba选择性扫描用于高效时间传播；3) 引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回去，减少遮挡伪影。

Result: 该方法有效解决了传统循环架构的问题，同时克服了Mamba在空间依赖建模上的局限性，实现了高效的时间传播和空间上下文聚合。

Conclusion: GSMamba混合架构成功结合了自注意力的空间建模能力和Mamba的高效时间传播，为视频超分辨率提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Conclusion: 所提出的自监督学习策略在具有挑战性的单次不完整观测设置下有效，为难以获取真实数据的逆问题提供了可行的学习解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Motivation: 监控场景中相机距离变化导致行人图像分辨率差异显著，使得低分辨率图像难以与高分辨率图像匹配，限制了行人重识别性能。现有方法依赖超分辨率或联合学习，增加了复杂度且性能已达瓶颈。

Method: 基于语义方向在特征空间中的发现，提出VPFA框架，通过向量平移操作建模分辨率特定特征差异，从新的角度进行跨分辨率行人重识别。

Result: 在多个跨分辨率行人重识别基准测试中，该方法显著优于之前的最先进基线模型，同时获得更高的效率。

Conclusion: 基于新发现的语义方向在特征空间中的存在，提出的VPFA框架在跨分辨率行人重识别任务中表现出有效性和优越性。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR是一种创新的视频超分辨率方法，采用自回归单步扩散范式，解决了长视频处理中的效率和可扩展性问题，实现了58倍加速并保持语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个主要挑战：多步去噪导致效率低下，以及时间分解引起伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练的DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉引导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 在长视频评估基准上达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法实现高达58倍加速。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效、可扩展的无界长度视频处理。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖基于标记的架构，但有效融合文本与视觉标记仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出JEPA-T框架，将图像和标题编码为离散标记，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理，加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率、开放词汇泛化能力，并持续优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机位姿的图像开始建图，在最坏情况下仍需数小时，最好情况也需要几分钟。本文旨在探索是否能在更短时间内达到竞争性精度。

Method: 将多张建图图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机位姿。结合图像检索技术实现端到端的快速定位。

Result: FastForward在最小化建图准备时间的情况下达到了最先进的精度，并且在未见过的领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了通过单次前向传播实现快速而准确的视觉定位是可行的，为实时定位系统提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Motivation: 自回归模型在序列建模中表现出色，但视觉信号的空间特性与下一个标记预测的顺序依赖性存在冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用全局上下文和标记间关系，联合优化自回归模型生成的所有标记，缓解序列生成中的错误累积问题。

Result: 实验证明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块能有效提升自回归模型在视觉语言任务中的表现，通过改善空间对应建模来解决顺序依赖与空间特性之间的冲突。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Motivation: 重新定义先前伪离散方法，通过在one-hot空间中直接保持扩散特性，建立判别式学习和生成式学习之间的桥梁。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立联系。

Result: 在分类任务上优于基线方法，并在图像描述生成中展现出优秀的文本生成能力，各组件通过大量消融实验验证了可衡量的增益。

Conclusion: ADD框架成功地在one-hot空间中实现了真实的离散扩散，为判别式和生成式学习提供了协同设计。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

TL;DR: 提出SoftCFG方法解决自回归图像生成中CFG的引导衰减和过度引导问题，通过不确定性加权引导和步长归一化实现更稳定的条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用CFG时面临两个关键问题：引导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码进程快速消失）和过度引导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）。

Method: 提出SoftCFG方法，通过不确定性加权在所有token序列中分布自适应扰动，让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的引导；引入步长归一化来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最先进的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决了CFG在自回归模型中的应用问题。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

<details>

Motivation: CAM及其变体虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但无法提供这些激活背后的语义洞察，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获取通道级语义表示，与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述，并将特征通道分组以提供更细粒度的视觉-文本解释。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的理由，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM成功地将CAM的空间定位与视觉语言模型的语义能力相结合，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富、更可解释的解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Motivation: 当前视频问答任务虽然支持1500+帧的长上下文窗口，但仅对应50秒视频，存在信息损失问题。需要更高效的方法来处理长视频内容。

Method: 构建1fps输入源（使用混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化），在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行监督微调和直接偏好优化，包含推理和最终答案的两轮目标。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均保持性能提升，显示了对时间证据摘要的强大鲁棒性，在TVQA的零样本评估中也观察到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，且作为奖励模型能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的高光谱分类模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，而现有的防御方法通常依赖定制化设计，可扩展性有限且无法有效防御强攻击。

Method: 引入对抗训练到高光谱领域，提出AT-RA方法，通过数据增加光谱信息多样性并确保空间平滑性来保护光谱语义信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，AT-RA将对抗鲁棒性提升了21.34%（对抗AutoAttack）和18.78%（对抗PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提升了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据特有的挑战，显著提升了模型对抗攻击的防御能力，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a

*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于扩散模型的安全、高质量可逆人脸匿名化方法，通过结合密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示，在保护隐私的同时确保只有授权方能够恢复原始人脸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸匿名化方法在安全方案、高质量图像生成和可逆性之间难以平衡。扩散模型能生成高质量匿名图像但缺乏密钥机制，无法确保只有授权方能够逆转过程。

Method: 将密钥与扩散模型的潜在人脸表示相结合，使用面部掩码约束生成以保留身份无关特征，通过确定性前向和后向扩散过程确保只有正确密钥才能恢复原始人脸。

Result: 该方法生成的人脸匿名图像与原始人脸视觉相似度更低，相比先前工作具有更好的匿名效果，同时保持高质量图像生成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，在隐私保护和身份认证需求之间提供了良好平衡。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeySG是一个分层3D场景图框架，通过关键帧选择和多模态信息增强，结合分层RAG管道处理复杂查询，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法存在语义关系预定义限制，大型环境序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口，需要更通用、可扩展的场景表示方法。

Method: 构建分层图结构（楼层、房间、对象、功能元素），通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧选择，利用VLM提取多模态信息，采用分层RAG管道进行上下文检索。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了更好的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过关键帧增强的分层图表示和分层RAG管道，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为机器人推理和规划提供了更强大的基础。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 动态视图合成已有显著进展，但从非标定、随意拍摄的视频中重建场景仍然具有挑战性，因为优化速度慢且参数估计复杂。

Method: 通过深度视觉SLAM进行几何恢复，然后通过网格剪枝优化场景表示。引入简化的4D高斯表示来处理时间动态。

Result: 模型大小减少到原始尺寸的10%以下，训练速度提升30倍，训练时间缩短到2分钟内，在多个基准测试中保持竞争力。

Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing
scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow
optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present
Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D
representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes,
without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric
recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene
representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining
geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint.
To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian
representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within
two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several
benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the
Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to
in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability. Our project website is

TL;DR: 提出Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement方法，用于多标签理解自车视角行车记录仪视频，通过游戏论融合多个视觉语言模型，减少幻觉问题，提升自动驾驶系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶系统中应用增多，但幻觉问题限制了其在安全关键流程中的可靠性，需要一种能够校准多模型输出的融合方法。

Method: 使用基于Shapley值的团队信用更新、上下文感知的Dawid-Skene方法，结合协议保护机制，将模型报告转换为对数似然比，与上下文先验和公共声誉状态结合，生成可阈值化的后验概率。

Result: 与最佳单模型相比，汉明距离减少23%，宏F1提升55%，微F1提升47%，支持VLM融合作为自动驾驶流程中校准、可解释且鲁棒的决策支持组件。

Conclusion: 该方法能够放大可靠模型间的一致性，保留独特正确的单模型信号，适应漂移，为自动驾驶系统提供可靠的视觉语言模型融合解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，能够实现空间一致的长时程探索。通过单张全景图像输入，生成未来视频帧并演化3D重建，利用显式3D记忆提供空间引导，显著提升视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 受人类在经历过的3D环境中进行心理探索和重放能力的启发，旨在开发能够实现空间一致长时程探索的世界模型。

Method: 1. 使用具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧
2. 通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建
3. 基于演化显式3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的全面基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提高了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvoWorld通过利用演化3D重建作为视频生成的显式空间引导，在长时程空间一致世界建模方面取得了重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主体编辑的挑战，包括提示侧多模态条件不足和视频中掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 使用提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，通过大型模型生成多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后将先验掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型来合成编辑后的视频。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit具有强大的泛化能力，兼容任何掩码驱动的视频生成模型，显著提高了整体性能，为视频多主体编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

*T. James Brandt*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估框架，在聊天机器人风格适应中平衡语言同步性和长期稳定性，通过多种策略找到帕累托最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自适应聊天机器人模仿用户语言风格可以建立融洽关系，但无限制模仿可能导致系统不稳定或谄媚，需要在即时同步性和长期稳定性之间找到平衡。

Method: 使用8维风格向量和闭环"基础+增量"提示架构，在人类对话数据集上模拟比较多种适应策略（无限制、上限、指数移动平均、死区、混合策略）。

Result: 有界策略在稳定性方面获得显著提升（从0.542到0.878，+62%），同步性仅减少17%。混合策略将突兀的语气变化从0.254降至0.092。

Conclusion: 该框架为风格适应提供了通用评估工具，识别了帕累托有效策略，并在多个数据集和模型上验证了平衡同步性与稳定性的重要性。

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and
engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or
sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the
core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony
against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a
closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare
explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear
Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a
modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from
0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this
trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora
(DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation
across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility,"
showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring
register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that
are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides
a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that
identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets
and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system
maintainability.

Conclusion: 研究表明，将大型语言模型与先进硬件加速相结合，在神经系统疾病的转录组学表征方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent
seizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide.
While progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based
transcriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly
complex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep
learning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene
expression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs
GPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion
parameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor
Core GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient
preprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent
pattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets
including GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal
several significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal
astrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored
excitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in
combination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic
characterization in neurological diseases.

Motivation: 传统中间帧生成研究主要关注单角色，扩展到密集交互角色极具挑战性，需要精确的时空对应来维持交互，同时创建向预定关键姿势的自然过渡。

Method: 提出跨空间中间帧方法，在不同条件表示空间中建模每个角色的交互；通过对抗学习识别周期性交互模式维持交互质量；学习精炼漂移的潜在空间防止姿态误差累积。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了双角色交互中间帧生成的挑战，实现了长时程、高质量的交互运动合成。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes.
Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to
densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise
spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

Motivation: 传统Wasserstein距离在高维分布中计算成本过高，而切片Wasserstein距离的蒙特卡洛估计器存在高方差问题，导致噪声梯度和收敛缓慢。

Method: 将加权储层采样集成到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应保留信息丰富的投影方向，实现稳定梯度同时保持无偏性。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实世界任务（如色彩校正和扩散引导）中，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSWD通过自适应投影方向选择，有效解决了SWD的高方差问题，提供了更稳定和高效的分布匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

Abstract: We present an audio-driven real-time system for animating photorealistic 3D
facial avatars with minimal latency, designed for social interactions in
virtual reality for anyone. Central to our approach is an encoder model that
transforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,
which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统依赖固定拓扑结构或外部LLM判断器，增加了复杂性。需要一种能够动态适应通信结构的方法来优化协作机制。

Method: 使用响应条件化框架，代理独立生成响应并基于Shapley值近似评估同伴贡献，构建有向无环图来调节响应传播，确保高贡献代理的信息优先传播。

Conclusion: SelfOrg框架能够实现代理的自组织协作，无需额外监督或训练，正确响应自然主导信息流，多个代理增加了正确性概率。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the
potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However,
this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between
agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure
between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches
rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,
or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,
we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication
on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and
assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of
the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message
transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically
updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.
Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without
additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg
framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account
the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak
LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak
regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple
agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses
naturally dominate the information flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究改进了transducer的发射延迟，但针对块处理编码延迟的改进工作较少。希望通过频繁发射小移位块而非稀疏大块来降低延迟，但会导致计算成本增加。

Method: 提出Spiralformer编码器，采用螺旋式层计算：循环跳过层计算并在每个块中螺旋移动计算层，在块处理过程中完成所有层的计算。

Result: 在Librispeech上平均token发射延迟减少21.6%，在CSJ上减少7.0%，同时保持相似的计算成本和词错误率。

Conclusion: Spiralformer通过高效的层计算策略成功降低了流式语音识别的编码延迟，在保持性能的同时显著改善了实时性。

Abstract: For streaming speech recognition, a Transformer-based encoder has been widely
used with block processing. Although many studies addressed improving emission
latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding
latency of the block processing. We seek to reduce latency by frequently
emitting a chunk with a small shift rather than scarce large-chunk emissions,
resulting in higher computational costs. To efficiently compute with the small
chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block
processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer
computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block
spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block
processing. Experimentally, we observed that our method achieved 21.6%
reduction in the averaged token emission delay in Librispeech, and 7.0% in CSJ,
compared with the baseline with similar computational cost and word error
rates.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本研究使用自然语言处理和机器学习分析YouTube上关于2025年6月伊朗-以色列冲突的12万条评论，揭示数字对话中的话语偏见和算法影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析伊朗-以色列冲突在数字平台上的话语表现，识别媒体和算法偏见如何塑造数字对话，探讨主流媒体中被忽视的叙事。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：定量阶段使用BERT和XLM-RoBERTa模型将评论分类为10个类别；定性阶段进行媒体背景和意识形态叙事的批判分析，辅以人工标注和监督训练。

Result: 研究发现亲巴勒斯坦和反美/反以色列话语明显过度代表，而亲美和反巴勒斯坦立场边缘化。伊朗在冲突期间成为数字对话的核心角色，表明叙事框架的转变。算法偏见在放大某些话语的同时限制其他话语。

Conclusion: 本研究结合计算分析和哲学批判，为数字争议研究提供了可复制的方法论框架，是首批通过人工智能和批判分析在YouTube上映射国际冲突话语的西班牙语研究之一，揭示了常被忽视的叙事不对称性。

Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel
conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on
YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors
involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital
conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was
adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and
machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments
into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media
context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual
annotation and supervised training. This strategy enabled the integration of
statistical robustness with contextual understanding. Results and conclusions.
The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and
anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and
anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in
global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the
conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks.
Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying
certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work
combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of
digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in
geopolitical contexts. It is one of the first Spanish-language studies to map,
through artificial intelligence and critical analysis, discourses on an
international conflict on YouTube, highlighting asymmetries and narrative
disputes that are often overlooked.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用多模态大语言模型分析脑电图信号的新方法，通过将EEG信号和对应模态映射到统一语义空间来解决跨模态表示学习中的挑战，并构建了首个用于指令调优的跨任务EEG数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑电图信号同时编码认知过程和内在神经状态，这种复杂性导致EEG配对数据模态不匹配，阻碍了有效的跨模态表示学习。

Method: 通过枢轴研究揭示模态间的互补关系，将EEG信号和对应模态映射到统一语义空间，并引入WaveMind-Instruct-338k数据集进行指令调优。

Result: 所提出的模型在四个下游任务中表现出稳健的分类准确性，同时支持灵活、开放式的对话能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经科学研究和发展通用EEG模型提供了有价值的见解，实现了脑电信号的广义解释。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

TL;DR: 提出一种从秀丽隐杆线虫运动记录中提取行为单元的方法，该方法不需要完整观察虫体，使用无监督自动流程定义行为单元，避免预设假设带来的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为模拟方法需要完整观察虫体，但在高密度条件下难以实现，而高密度条件对理解社会环境影响个体行为很重要。

Method: 使用无监督自动流程从单点追踪数据中提取行为单元，通过比较手动设计的行为单元进行解释，并用基于代理的模型评估方法有效性。

Result: 结果表明即使从单点追踪也能出现时空运动模式，这些模式在行为分类过程中起基础性作用。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提取行为单元，无需完整虫体观察，为高密度条件下的行为研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The 1mm roundworm C. elegans is a model organism used in many sub-areas of
biology to investigate different types of biological processes. In order to
complement the n-vivo analysis with computer-based investigations, several
methods have been proposed to simulate the worm behaviour. These methods
extract discrete behavioural units from the flow of the worm movements using
different types of tracking techniques. Nevertheless, these techniques require
a clear view of the entire worm body, which is not always achievable. For
example, this happens in high density worm conditions, which are particularly
informative to understand the influence of the social context on the single
worm behaviour. In this paper, we illustrate and evaluate a method to extract
behavioural units from recordings of C. elegans movements which do not
necessarily require a clear view of the entire worm body. Moreover, the
behavioural units are defined by an unsupervised automatic pipeline which frees
the process from predefined assumptions that inevitably bias the behavioural
analysis. The behavioural units resulting from the automatic method are
interpreted by comparing them with hand-designed behavioural units. The
effectiveness of the automatic method is evaluated by measuring the extent to
which the movement of a simulated worm, with an agent-based model, matches the
movement of a natural worm. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal
locomotory patterns emerge even from single point worm tracking. Moreover, we
show that such patterns represent a fundamental aspect of the behavioural
classification process.

TL;DR: 提出了EditTrack框架，用于检测图像是否由特定基础图像通过AI编辑模型生成，并能识别具体使用的编辑模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能检测图像是否经过AI编辑，无法判断是否从特定基础图像编辑而来，也无法识别具体编辑模型。

Method: 基于对编辑过程的四个关键观察，提出重新编辑策略和精心设计的相似性度量方法。

Result: 在5个最先进编辑模型和6个数据集上的评估显示，EditTrack在检测和归因方面均优于5个基线方法。

Conclusion: EditTrack是首个解决图像编辑检测和归因问题的框架，能有效识别图像是否从特定基础图像编辑而来以及使用的具体编辑模型。

Abstract: In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection
and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to
determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an
AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing
model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated
images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether
an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a
particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first
framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on
four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel
re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to
determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,
by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models
across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate
detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-RFT是一个基于世界模型的强化微调框架，通过数据驱动的可控模拟器来增强视觉-语言-动作模型的泛化性和鲁棒性，仅需不到400步微调就能超越监督学习基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型严重依赖模仿学习，容易产生累积错误且在分布偏移下鲁棒性差。强化学习可以缓解这些问题，但通常需要昂贵的真实世界交互或面临模拟到现实的差距。

Method: 使用从真实交互数据训练的世界模型作为可控模拟器，该模拟器根据动作预测未来视觉观察，允许策略展开并获取基于目标达成参考的密集轨迹级奖励。

Result: 仅需不到400步微调，VLA-RFT就超越了强监督基线，比基于模拟器的强化学习更高效，在扰动条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，保持稳定的任务执行。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的强化微调是增强VLA模型泛化性和鲁棒性的实用后训练范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出Hybrid Training (HyT)框架，让视觉语言动作模型能够在训练时学习思维链，但在推理时可以选择跳过思维生成，从而减少延迟并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链技术虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但会增加推理时间，这在需要实时动作的机器人操作场景中影响可用性。研究探索是否必须生成长思维链才能获得性能提升。

Method: HyT框架让模型在训练时学习思维和动作，但在推理时可以灵活选择：直接预测动作、生成思维或遵循指令。模型学习有条件地预测多样化输出。

Result: 在模拟基准测试和真实世界实验中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HyT框架使视觉语言动作模型既能从思维链中获益，又能在推理时避免思维生成带来的延迟，同时支持灵活的推理模式。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

### [168] [HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695)
*Myungkyu Koo,Daewon Choi,Taeyoung Kim,Kyungmin Lee,Changyeon Kim,Youngyo Seo,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET是一个可扩展框架，用于使视觉语言动作模型能够关注历史上下文进行动作预测，通过引入时刻令牌和轻量级记忆模块，在需要历史信息的长期任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作任务本质上是历史依赖的，但现有视觉语言动作模型仅依赖当前观测而忽略历史上下文，这限制了在需要历史信息的任务中的表现。

Method: 引入时刻令牌紧凑编码每个时间步的感知信息，通过时间对比学习初始化表示；使用轻量级记忆模块整合过去时刻令牌为记忆特征，用于动作预测。

Result: 在GR00T N1.5上，HAMLET在历史依赖的真实世界任务中达到76.4%的平均成功率，比基线提升47.2%；在RoboCasa Kitchen上从64.1%提升到66.4%，在LIBERO上从95.6%提升到97.7%。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功将最先进的VLA转化为历史感知策略，在需要历史上下文的长期任务中表现出显著改进，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

*Kajwan Ziaoddini*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文通过结合基于内容的音乐分析和轻量级歌词网络视角，研究了在线社区中音乐符号的生产和传播。研究发现过去十年能量下降、舞曲性上升，歌词呈现以人称代词为中心的词汇特征，不同风格音乐的情绪差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线社区中音乐符号的生产和传播机制，理解音乐属性与歌词内容如何共同塑造文化意义和社区认同。

Method: 使用275首热门歌曲构建可复现分析流程，结合音频描述符（能量、舞曲性、响度等）和完整歌词转录，进行时间趋势分析、词汇显著性和共现建模、按流派情绪分析。

Result: 发现能量十年间从79降至58，舞曲性从59升至73；情绪值在2013年达峰值63，2014-2016年降至42后部分恢复；歌词分析显示以"我/你/我/我的"为中心的人称代词词汇；不同流派情绪差异显著，R&B最高(96)，拉丁/雷鬼顿最低(37)。

Conclusion: 主流音乐呈现出边缘文化代码的主流化趋势，商业偏好放松但节奏感强的制作风格，能维持集体参与而不需要最大强度。方法上贡献了整合音乐信息检索和网络分析的工作流程。

Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in
online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight
network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping
songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness,
liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric
transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal
trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and
(iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 ->
58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and
dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows
strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations
for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51);
danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric
tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and
a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors
mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&B exhibits the
highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70),
whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a
subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of
previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet
rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without
maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated
MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure,
lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to
modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or
community-level diffusion studies.

*Chen-An Li,Tzu-Han Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在文本推理任务中不需要音频输入，不相关的音频（包括静音、合成噪声和环境声音）仍会降低大型音频语言模型的准确性和稳定性。干扰严重程度与音频时长、振幅和解码温度正相关。静音的干扰效果与合成噪声相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在真实噪声环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分探索，本研究旨在了解不相关音频如何影响文本推理任务的性能。

Method: 在三个文本基准测试上评估模型，测试不同音频条件（静音、合成噪声、环境声音）对文本推理的影响，并评估缓解策略（提示和自我一致性方法）的效果。

Result: 所有不相关音频都会降低准确性和增加预测波动性；静音的干扰效果与合成噪声相当；更大模型更具韧性但仍有脆弱性；提示方法效果有限，自我一致性可改善稳定性但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: 跨模态干扰是鲁棒性的关键挑战，需要开发能保持推理性能的高效融合策略来处理不相关输入。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) unify speech and text processing, but
their robustness in noisy real-world settings remains underexplored. We
investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and
environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary.
Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio
reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of
interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated
decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as
strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience,
vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test
mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness,
whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased
computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness
challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve
reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.

TL;DR: 大型音频语言模型在涉及有序选项推理的任务中存在选择偏差问题，答案选项的顺序会影响模型预测结果，导致性能波动高达24%甚至改变模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型音频语言模型在涉及有序选项推理任务中是否存在选择偏差，即模型预测是否受到答案选项顺序的影响，这关系到模型评估的可靠性。

Method: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试及其口语对应版本上对六个大型音频语言模型进行广泛实验，通过打乱答案选项顺序来测试模型性能变化，并研究基于排列的策略来缓解偏差。

Result: 实验表明所有模型都存在选择偏差，打乱答案选项顺序会导致性能波动高达24%，甚至改变模型排名，基于排列的策略在大多数情况下可以有效缓解偏差。

Conclusion: 这是对大型音频语言模型中该问题的首次系统研究，揭示了当前评估实践可靠性的问题，希望提高认识并推动该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) are often used in tasks that involve
reasoning over ordered options. An open question is whether their predictions
are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of
selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and
analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this
bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used
benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options
can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings,
raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also
study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most
cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in
LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this
direction.

TL;DR: MOS-RMBench：将多种MOS数据集统一为偏好比较基准，系统评估三种奖励建模范式（标量、半标量、生成式），发现标量模型表现最佳，并提出MOS感知GRM提升细粒度质量判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音质量评估依赖主观评分（如MOS），存在标注成本高、评分标准不一致、可复现性差等问题，需要建立自动化的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建MOS-RMBench统一基准，系统评估标量奖励模型、半标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型（GRM），并提出MOS感知GRM，通过MOS差异自适应调整奖励函数。

Result: 标量模型整体表现最佳（准确率>74%）；所有模型在合成语音上表现较差；在MOS差异小的样本对上表现不佳；MOS感知GRM显著提升细粒度判别能力。

Conclusion: 建立了语音质量评估的基准和方法框架，MOS感知GRM有效提升了挑战性样本的判别能力，为自动语音质量评估研究提供了更严谨和可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding
the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has
traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score
(MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent
rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we
introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS
datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation
across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct
and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models,
semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments
reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall
performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform
considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models
struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on
these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an
MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale
rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results
show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality
discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging
cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological
framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech
quality assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出MW损失函数，通过最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量来直接优化AUC，解决了传统对比损失在检索任务中的校准和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统噪声对比估计（NCE）目标函数存在根本性缺陷，无法保证相关文档得分高于不相关文档，导致检索器校准不佳和下游任务性能下降。

Method: 引入MW损失函数，通过最小化得分差异的二元交叉熵来最大化AUC，提供理论保证该损失直接上界AoC。

Result: 实验表明，使用MW损失训练的检索器在AUC和标准检索指标上持续优于对比损失方法。

Conclusion: MW损失是比对比损失更优的替代方案，能产生校准更好、判别能力更强的检索器，特别适用于RAG等高风险应用。

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

TL;DR: MILCO是一个多语言稀疏检索架构，通过多语言连接器将不同语言的查询和文档映射到共享的英语词汇空间，结合稀疏对齐预训练和对比训练，在保持透明性的同时实现高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习稀疏检索方法难以扩展到英语以外的语言，且罕见实体在投影到英语时容易丢失，需要增强多语言检索的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：稀疏对齐预训练+对比训练，引入LexEcho头部通过[ECHO]令牌增强源语言视图，支持后处理剪枝实现动态效率。

Result: 在多语言和跨语言LSR任务中达到最先进性能，优于BGE-M3和Qwen3-Embed等基准模型，在平均仅30个活跃维度时仍优于1024维的Qwen3-Embed。

Conclusion: MILCO通过多语言词汇空间映射和LexEcho增强机制，成功解决了多语言稀疏检索的扩展性和鲁棒性问题，实现了效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

*Roksana Goworek,Olivia Macmillan-Scott,Eda B. Özyiğit*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于跨语言信息检索(CLIR)的综述，从早期的翻译方法到最新的嵌入驱动和生成技术，全面回顾了该领域的发展历程、核心组件、评估方法和可用资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CLIR研究通常将任务视为单语检索加上翻译，将检索方法和跨语言能力分开处理。随着多语言大语言模型的出现，需要系统梳理从翻译方法到嵌入方法的技术演进，为构建更鲁棒、包容和自适应的检索系统提供指导。

Method: 采用综述研究方法，系统分析了CLIR的核心组件（查询扩展、排序、重排序、问答）、评估实践和可用资源，涵盖了从早期翻译方法到现代嵌入驱动和生成技术的完整发展脉络。

Result: 识别了数据不平衡和语言变异等持续挑战，同时指出了推动公平有效跨语言信息检索的有前景方向。多语言LLM和跨语言嵌入引入了新范式，提供了改进的检索性能并支持答案生成。

Conclusion: 通过将CLIR置于信息检索和多语言处理的更广泛背景下，本文不仅回顾了当前能力，还为构建鲁棒、包容和自适应的检索系统指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

TL;DR: 提出自适应推理抑制（ARS）方法，通过动态抑制冗余推理步骤，在保持准确性的同时显著提升大型推理语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本降低。

Method: 采用训练免费的自适应推理抑制方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值来动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法有效解决了大型推理语言模型的效率问题，在多个模型架构上都表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自动化评估AI系统回答患者健康问题的可行性，发现精心设计的自动化评估方法能够有效替代人工专家评审，实现AI系统的规模化比较评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人工专家评审——劳动密集且耗时，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的一致性不一且往往依赖于上下文。

Method: 研究人员对100个患者案例收集了28个AI系统的2800个回答，从三个维度进行评估：是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否使用通用医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为指标锚点。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明精心设计的自动化评估能够有效替代人工评审。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者-临床医生沟通，为医疗AI系统的规模化评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON是一个统一的框架，通过自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化，有效压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%的同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在动态真实环境中的部署，代理任务面临上下文长度增长带来的成本和效率问题，现有压缩方法主要关注单步任务或窄应用。

Method: 利用压缩指南优化：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南；还将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%，保持95%以上准确率，并将较小LM作为长视野代理的性能提升达46%。

Conclusion: ACON框架有效解决了代理任务中的上下文压缩问题，通过优化压缩指南和模型蒸馏，在减少内存使用的同时保持任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个AI驱动的科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并基于研究差距收敛到可测试假设。相比基线AI，在可行性和基础性方面显著提升，实验执行成功率更高，并能通过奖励模型从先前实验结果中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，以及无法适应先前实验结果的问题。

Method: 1) 文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势；2) 探索假设设计空间；3) 通过识别研究差距和论证设计选择收敛到精确可测试假设；4) 学习奖励模型基于先前实验结果对新假设评分。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)上显著优于基线AI；与CodeScientist代理配合时，成功执行更多(20 vs 11/40)，失败更少(16 vs 21/40)；奖励模型比未训练基线提升约28%。

Conclusion: HARPA代表了AI驱动科学发现领域的重要进展，通过模拟人类研究者的构思流程，生成更可行、基础更扎实的假设，并能从经验中学习改进假设质量。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Expected Attention方法，通过预测未来查询对KV对的关注程度来估计重要性，实现无需训练的KV缓存压缩，并发布KVPress库包含20多种压缩技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是LLM推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的压缩方法面临实际限制：未来token的注意力分数在压缩时不可用，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整注意力矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Expected Attention方法实现了有效的KV缓存压缩而不会降低性能，并提供了KVPress库来促进相关研究。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

TL;DR: 提出SMDS方法自动发现语言模型中的特征流形，发现不同特征形成圆形、直线、聚类等几何结构，这些结构稳定且支持推理功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中概念编码几何结构的通用发现方法，需要自动化的特征流形发现技术。

Method: 引入监督多维缩放(SMDS)方法，模型无关地自动发现特征流形，以时间推理为案例研究。

Result: 发现不同特征形成各种几何结构，这些结构反映概念属性、跨模型稳定、支持推理、并随上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中发挥功能作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码并转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了VIRTUE模型，将视觉交互能力引入嵌入模型，通过分割模型处理视觉提示来精确定位图像特定区域，在36个通用任务和5个视觉交互任务上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域（如点、边界框、遮罩），限制了人机交互应用。为嵌入模型添加视觉交互能力可以解锁新的应用场景，并让模型学习图像中的实体级信息来补充全局表示。

Method: 提出VIRTUE模型，结合分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力，分割模型可以处理视觉提示来精确定位图像中的特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将视觉交互能力扩展到表示学习领域，显著提升了嵌入模型在处理复杂场景和用户意图定位方面的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭与遮挡部分对应的模型组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒可解释性方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒可解释性方法依赖遮挡输入部分产生的突变体，导致分布外图像，影响解释质量。选择合适遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 引入ConvAD机制，可轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法无需额外训练或微调，通过关闭模型中对遮挡部分敏感的组件来生成解释。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，AD解释相比传统遮挡方法在鲁棒性上提升了高达62.5%，且无需领域知识即可获得更稳健的解释。

Conclusion: ConvAD机制能够在不改变网络决策过程的前提下，提供更鲁棒的可解释性，解决了传统遮挡方法的关键缺陷。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的理论框架，证明n维平面最小化p-adic距离时必须通过至少n+1个数据点，这与欧几里得回归形成鲜明对比，更好地适应层次数据的离散特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器学习问题常涉及层次化数据，但传统欧几里得度量无法捕捉层次关系的离散分支特性，需要更适合的度量空间。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论基础，证明在p-adic度量下n维平面最小化距离时必须通过至少n+1个数据点的核心定理。

Result: 证明了p-adic回归的关键定理及其推论，在自然语言处理的两个应用（层次分类法和语法形态学建模）中展示了实际意义。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是正确处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基础方法，在层次数据中，选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Conclusion: GDLNN成功实现了图分类任务中高精度与可解释性的平衡，为图机器学习提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个从字典学习公式推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出新的AbsTopK SAE来解决双向概念表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏从字典学习公式推导的理论框架，且其稀疏正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单个特征表示双向概念的能力，导致语义轴分裂成冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见的SAE变体，并提出AbsTopK SAE——基于ℓ₀稀疏约束的新变体，通过对最大幅度激活应用硬阈值来保留正负激活。

Result: 在四个大语言模型和七个探测与引导任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重构保真度、增强了可解释性，并使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活，实现了更丰富的概念表示，解决了现有SAE在表示双向概念时的结构限制问题。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks

and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

*Yen-Shan Chen,Sian-Yao Huang,Cheng-Lin Yang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，通过可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域实现低成本、可扩展的攻击，在18个RAG设置中将攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，攻击者可在焦点区域插入语义诱饵或恶意指令。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，平均攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（+35.9个百分点，比先前工作高2.6倍），单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文主张将可解释性方法视为统计估计器，需要对结果进行方差和鲁棒性评估。通过对EAP-IG电路发现方法进行系统性稳定性分析，发现其存在高结构方差和超参数敏感性，建议在可解释性研究中常规报告稳定性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可信赖的人工智能需要超越黑盒性能指标，理解模型的内部计算。但机制可解释性方法的科学严谨性依赖于其发现的可靠性，需要从统计学角度评估可解释性方法。

Method: 对最先进的电路发现方法EAP-IG进行系统性稳定性分析，通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中注入噪声等控制扰动，评估其方差和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种模型和任务中，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，其发现的稳定性受到质疑。

Conclusion: 建议在可解释性研究领域常规报告稳定性指标，以促进更严谨和基于统计的可解释性科学发展。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文深入分析了基于分类器的质量过滤方法(CQF)，发现虽然CQF能提升下游任务性能，但未必改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，因为CQF会隐式过滤高质量数据集本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在包含混合质量文档的网络爬取数据上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。CQF方法被广泛使用，但其有效性机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过训练二元分类器区分预训练数据和小型高质量数据集，为每个预训练文档分配质量分数，仅保留高分文档。与通过随机标记置换获得合成数据的方法进行比较。

Result: CQF提升下游任务性能，但未增强高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与合成数据方法相比表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: CQF可能并未捕捉到有意义的数据质量概念，其有效性机制需要重新审视。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

TL;DR: GRPO算法通常需要大组规模来保证训练稳定性，但本文通过将其重构为对比学习形式，发现与DPO的关联，验证了仅需2个rollout的最小配置(2-GRPO)即可达到与16-GRPO相当的性能，大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GRPO需要大组规模的传统认知，通过将其与DPO关联，探索最小配置的可行性以减少计算成本。

Method: 将GRPO重构为对比学习形式，建立与DPO的理论联系，提出并验证仅需2个rollout的2-GRPO配置。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollout数量，训练时间减少70%以上。

Conclusion: GRPO的最小可行配置远小于传统认知，2-GRPO在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的训练范式正从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要能够与复杂环境交互的模拟器来促进这一转变。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包含多样化环境套件、集成工具和单文件示例脚本，支持五种流行的RL训练框架。使用ReBN算法在24个环境中建立基线。

Result: GEM提供了高性能的环境模拟，支持多种RL算法比较，并展示了ReBN在密集每轮奖励设置下的优势。

Conclusion: GEM框架可以加速未来智能体LLM研究，既可作为训练环境，也可作为评估工具包。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Method: 将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等测试环境中进行实证研究，分析任务复杂度、奖励稀疏度、策略梯度方法等关键因素的影响。

Result: 发现简单环境能预测代理在复杂任务中的泛化能力；密集奖励能加速训练但性能稳定性依赖RL算法选择；找到了最优的监督微调与RL训练比例；开发了跨三个支柱的协同设计训练方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一个系统的训练方法，指导环境、奖励和策略的协同设计，为多轮代理强化学习的研究和实践提供了有效指导。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习的价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，在推理任务上实现性能与效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLMs通过RL对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练批大小，并确定关注中等难度提示对策略的重要性。

Method: PCL使用与当前策略同步更新的价值模型，以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息性提示来优化训练。

Result: PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍更快的中间难度提示识别速度，避免昂贵的rollout，达到最高性能或显著减少达到相当性能的时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了上限性能和效率之间更好的权衡，价值模型能准确预测提示难度并引导关注逐渐更具挑战性的提示。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Motivation: 现有方法将异构信号压缩为单一优化目标，无法同时处理可验证奖励（数学准确性）、非验证主观偏好（人类价值观）和复杂交互场景（多轮AI辅导对话）等多维对齐需求。

Method: 1) 标准化过程奖励模型训练；2) 使用多头DPO（MAH-DPO）和向量化奖励进行多目标对齐；3) 提供细粒度推理时用户控制。

Result: 在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话实验中，该框架同时提高了多个目标的性能，最小化了跨目标权衡，并实现了灵活的推理时控制。

Conclusion: 该统一框架有效解决了多目标强化学习中的目标冲突问题，为LLM的多维对齐提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Conclusion: Toucan数据集为开源LLM智能体开发提供了高质量、多样化的训练资源，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展强化学习，但在数千步后性能达到平台期，存在明显的收益递减。本文探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展RL的补充范式。

Method: 提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行充分的探索。基于质量平衡方程分析，理论证明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，确保正确token概率质量的整体扩展。

Result: BroRL能够复活在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，并展示出稳健的持续改进。在1.5B模型上，在多样化基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充方法，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能瓶颈，实现持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，而LRP实现通常依赖未优化的启发式规则集，缺乏清晰度和与模型行为的一致性。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略（CMA-ES）来调整LRP超参数，基于定量可解释性指标（如忠实度或稀疏性）进行优化。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类特定特征具有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过原则性的任务特定优化，可以系统地提高归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量的变分潜在先验（EVaLP）方法，通过将VAE的先验建模为能量模型，并使用变分方法处理归一化常数，从而解决VAE生成模糊样本和先验空洞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE存在生成模糊样本和先验空洞问题，即先验高概率区域在后验中概率较低，导致生成质量差。需要既能灵活匹配后验又能快速采样的先验模型。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型，使用变分方法处理归一化常数，避免昂贵的MCMC采样。通过采样器网络近似变分形式，采用交替优化训练先验，生成时采样器简化为隐式变分先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，EVaLP在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法有效解决了VAE的先验空洞问题，在保持生成质量的同时提高了采样效率，为生成模型提供了新的先验建模思路。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的即插即用框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中迭代更新提示，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面存在不足，而现有的提示优化方法大多采用前馈方式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用强化学习，基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态迭代更新提示，而不是直接修改扩散模型权重。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散骨干网络上的实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示优化，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比，同时保持了基于提示对齐的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知的动态数据增强方法，根据样本对模型优化的影响动态调整增强强度，解决了传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法采用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变。如果不考虑这种动态性，会导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差，估计每个样本的影响。低方差样本增强更强以强调多样性，高方差样本增强更弱以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、无需辅助模型或策略调优的即插即用模块，能有效提升训练效果，具有实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需排练缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习方法，通过结合提示学习和NCM分类器有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本，要么依赖任务边界信息，但这会引发数据安全隐私问题，且在实际应用中任务边界往往难以确定。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本和不使用任务边界信息的情况下处理在线持续学习问题。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，所提方法在解决灾难性遗忘方面具有显著效果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需排练和任务边界的在线持续学习，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [204] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)来诊断持续学习中的捷径特征利用问题，发现CL方法在包含虚假捷径特征的任务中会表现出负适应延迟、正性能缺陷和负相对次优特征依赖的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征，这些特征在持续学习中会持续存在并加剧，导致类似认知定势效应的现象，阻碍新技能的获得。

Method: 引入ERI诊断指标，包含三个可解释方面：适应延迟(AD)、性能缺陷(PD)和相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上测试多种CL方法。

Result: CL方法比从头训练基准更早达到准确率阈值(负AD)，但在包含捷径特征的类别上最终准确率略低(正PD)。屏蔽捷径特征后CL方法准确率提升而基准下降(负SFR_rel)。

Conclusion: 在实验设置中，捷径特征对CL模型起到了干扰作用而非帮助作用，表明CL方法容易受到捷径特征的不利影响。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Method: 基于反演-再生范式，开发词到发声对象对齐的音频生成模型，弥合音频与视频生成模型在对象可控性上的差距；提出整体优化的反演-再生编辑算法，确保反演过程中的信息保留和更好的再生效果。

Conclusion: Object-AVEdit成功实现了对象级音视频编辑，在保持结构信息的同时实现了精细的音视频语义对齐。

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变诊断中表现出色，但仅依赖模型预测而不考虑置信度会在临床环境中带来风险和不确定性。

Method: 采用变分贝叶斯模型，结合拒绝机制来拒绝低置信度预测，评估指标包括接受预测的准确率、覆盖率、拒绝率和期望校准误差。

Result: 研究显示预测覆盖率与覆盖可靠性之间存在权衡，变分贝叶斯模型在预测糖尿病视网膜病变时采用更保守策略，拒绝不确定预测。

Conclusion: 不确定性估计和选择性拒绝的使用提高了模型在安全关键诊断用例中的可靠性，展示了准确性与谨慎性之间的明确权衡。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and
effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from
retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without
any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant
risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in
uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to
reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making
in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction
coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a
more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the
uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance
metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted
cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution,
establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection
improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective
clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive
Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this
study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer
Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and
white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural
networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an
end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked
ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to
optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art
accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and
91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming
conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve
interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI
techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and
attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter
slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These
results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical
decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with
RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture Stroke movements, (2) a mobile
application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and
feedback. When Stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the
system records skeleton sequences, which are then Assessed by the deep learning
model, RAST-G@. The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network

attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we
constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living

participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists.
Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline

Method: 扩展InfoVAE方法，显式最大化图像与潜在变量间的互信息，在两个队列（6527名健康对照和904名多发性硬化患者）上进行评估。

Result: 学习的潜在变量支持准确的脑年龄和SDMT回归，保留关键医学属性，形成直观的聚类，在重建和下游预测任务中始终优于其他VAE变体。

Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D
brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard
statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most
deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to
explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables,
producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful
content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527)
with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles
University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression,
preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid
interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks,
InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger
information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance
with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based
biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in
neurological disease.

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival
analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both
cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and
prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in
WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook
predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose
DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that
outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of
predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and
component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly
available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest
mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of
DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the
feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness
and interpretability of DPsurv.

Motivation: 解决SkinGPT-4等大型视觉语言模型在深色皮肤上的诊断性能偏差问题，提升在服务不足社区中的临床工作流程效能。

Method: 使用SCIN数据集评估SkinGPT-4在不同肤色上的性能偏差，开发微调模型进行自定义皮肤病分类，并采用偏见缓解策略。

Result: SkinGPT-4在肤色间平均人口均等性为0.10，最浅和最深肤色间差异达0.10-0.15。定制模型在视觉相似疾病对上平均F1为0.75，人口均等性达0.75。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在深色皮肤上表现较弱，存在模型偏见和幻觉问题。通过现有骨干网络训练准确、公平的模型是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease
images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its
training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting
diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in
SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema,
allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset.
We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin
disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical
evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from
300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity,
physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including
demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones.
SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick
types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones
across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy
occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1,
precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease
pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a
maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity
scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI,
indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed
weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation
criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings
demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing
backbones for custom skin disease classification.

Method: 将N-gram上下文整合到Swin Transformer中，扩展相邻窗口间的上下文感知范围

Result: BD-Rate相比现有可变码率学习图像压缩技术提升-5.86%，显著改善感兴趣区域(ROI)质量

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于制造和工业视觉系统等对象聚焦应用，通过增强上下文感知提升了压缩性能

Abstract: This paper presents an N-gram context-based Swin Transformer for learned
image compression. Our method achieves variable-rate compression with a single
model. By incorporating N-gram context into the Swin Transformer, we overcome
its limitation of neglecting larger regions during high-resolution image
reconstruction due to its restricted receptive field. This enhancement expands
the regions considered for pixel restoration, thereby improving the quality of
high-resolution reconstructions. Our method increases context awareness across
neighboring windows, leading to a -5.86\% improvement in BD-Rate over existing
variable-rate learned image compression techniques. Additionally, our model
improves the quality of regions of interest (ROI) in images, making it
particularly beneficial for object-focused applications in fields such as
manufacturing and industrial vision systems.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular
regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for
searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method
consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a
user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose
encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,
summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular
regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D
offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to
cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even
if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric
were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor
Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the
proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional
computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search
metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were
higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional
metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes.
Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise
search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis
using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D
full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned
rectangular tumor regions.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis
and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based
models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and
fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with
transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the
local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation
models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however,
they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this
end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that
integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation
performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial
Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages,
enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets
with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate
that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation
across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: 量子启发式框架QSearchNet通过量子干涉机制有效整合局部和全局图特征，在链路预测任务中展现出优越性能，特别是在复杂依赖场景下。

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory, critical
for understanding and forecasting the evolution of complex systems like social
and biological networks. While classical heuristics capture certain aspects of
graph topology, they often struggle to optimally integrate local and global
structural information or adapt to complex dependencies. Quantum computing
offers a powerful alternative by leveraging superposition for simultaneous
multi-path exploration and interference-driven integration of both local and
global graph features. In this work, we introduce QSearchNet, a
quantum-inspired framework based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk (DTQW) dynamics
and Grover's amplitude amplification. QSearchNet simulates a topology-aware
quantum evolution to propagate amplitudes across multiple nodes simultaneously.
By aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and oracle-like
phase-flip operation, it adaptively prioritizes multi-hop dependencies and
amplifies structurally relevant paths corresponding to potential connections.
Experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate competitive performance,
particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理代码仓库时缺乏长期记忆，每次都是从零开始处理，而人类开发者会积累仓库的长期知识。

Method: 引入工具让代理能够从非参数化内存中检索历史提交、关联问题和活跃代码区域的功能摘要。

Result: 实验表明，增强这种记忆能力能显著提升LocAgent在SWE-bench-verified和SWE-bench-live基准上的性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究有助于开发能够积累和利用过去经验的智能代理，更接近人类开发者的专业能力。

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software
engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language
agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the
repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is
typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In
contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as
the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and
their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such
memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized
resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that
allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent
historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of
actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We
demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a
state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the
more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards
developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for
long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.
