### [2] [Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15830)
*Riccardo Di Sipio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大语言模型（LLM）优化中，信息几何如何通过Fisher信息度量提供更原则化的学习框架，并讨论了其在量子增强系统中的潜在应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在高维参数空间中的优化问题，尤其是非欧几里得结构下的学习现象，如尖锐极小值和泛化能力。

Method: 利用信息几何中的Fisher信息度量和自然梯度下降法，分析LLM训练中的几何特性。

Result: 信息几何视角有助于理解LLM训练中的现象，如尖锐极小值和泛化能力，并可能为量子增强系统提供高效优化方法。

Conclusion: 信息几何为LLM优化提供了新的理论框架，未来可能在量子计算领域进一步拓展应用。

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

### [3] [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15841)
*Zijian Zhou,Ao Qu,Zhaoxuan Wu,Sunghwan Kim,Alok Prakash,Daniela Rus,Jinhua Zhao,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1是一种强化学习框架，通过恒定内存处理多轮任务，提升性能并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统依赖全上下文提示，导致内存增长、计算成本增加和推理性能下降。

Method: MEM1通过更新紧凑的内部状态整合记忆和推理，并丢弃无关信息。

Result: 在多个领域中，MEM1-7B性能提升3.5倍，内存减少3.7倍，且能泛化到训练范围之外。

Conclusion: MEM1展示了推理驱动内存整合的潜力，为长时交互代理提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

### [4] [Finance Language Model Evaluation (FLaME)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15846)
*Glenn Matlin,Mika Okamoto,Huzaifa Pardawala,Yang Yang,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个金融语言模型评估基准FLaME，全面研究了23种基础语言模型在20个金融NLP任务中的表现，并开源了框架软件和数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在金融领域专业任务中的潜力，填补现有评估方法的不足。

Method: 开发FLaME基准，对23种基础语言模型和强化推理语言模型进行实证研究。

Result: 展示了语言模型在金融NLP任务中的潜力，纠正了对其性能的低估。

Conclusion: FLaME为金融NLP任务提供了有效的评估工具，证明了语言模型在该领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to
comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical
study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source
our framework software along with all data and results.

### [5] [Entropy-Driven Pre-Tokenization for Byte-Pair Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15889)
*Yifan Hu,Frank Liang,Dachuan Zhao,Jonathan Geuter,Varshini Reddy,Craig W. Schmidt,Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于熵的预分词策略，改进BPE在中文等未分词语言中的表现，显著提升了分词的精确度、召回率和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE在未分词语言（如中文）中因忽略语言边界而表现不佳，需改进其分词效果。

Method: 提出两种熵引导的预分词策略：1）利用点互信息和左右熵识别连贯字符；2）利用GPT-2模型的预测熵检测边界不确定性。

Result: 在PKU数据集上，两种方法显著提升了分词的精确度、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 熵引导的预分词策略能更好地对齐语言学单位，并为低资源和多语言场景下的分词提供改进方向。

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

### [6] [Language Models can perform Single-Utterance Self-Correction of Perturbed Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15894)
*Sam Silver,Jimin Sun,Ivan Zhang,Sara Hooker,Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）具有内在的自我纠正能力，即使未针对长链思维（CoT）进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在数学推理中的自我纠正能力，以解决其在问题描述和提示策略上的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验测量模型对合成扰动的自我纠正能力，观察其在CoT推理中的表现。

Result: 发现LLMs具有从隐式到显式的广泛自我纠正行为，能力比文献中常见的更强。

Conclusion: LLMs的内在自我纠正能力表明，当前推理研究可能是对模型已有特性的放大。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

### [7] [From RAG to Agentic: Validating Islamic-Medicine Responses with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15911)
*Mohammad Amaan Sayeed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Raza Imam,Shahab Saquib Sohail,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Tibbe-AG评估框架，结合伊斯兰医学文本与AI技术，验证文化敏感的医疗问答系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰医学文本如《医典》和《先知医学》蕴含丰富预防与疗法，但未被现代AI充分利用。现有语言模型评测缺乏文化背景验证。

Method: 设计Tibbe-AG框架，通过30个精选问题评估三种LLM（直接生成、检索增强生成、科学自评过滤），并由次级LLM评分。

Result: 检索提升事实准确性13%，自评提示再增10%改进，结合传统文本与AI技术实现可靠医疗问答。

Conclusion: 融合古典文本、检索与自评，可构建文化敏感的医疗问答系统。

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

### [8] [Reranking-based Generation for Unbiased Perspective Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15925)
*Narutatsu Ri,Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进政治观点摘要的方法，通过识别可靠指标和优化LLM方法，提升了摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架依赖传统指标，未验证其适用性，且改进摘要生成方法的研究尚不成熟。

Method: 构建测试集评估指标可靠性，比较传统与语言模型指标，并研究基于重排和偏好调优的LLM方法。

Result: 语言模型指标优于传统指标，重排和偏好调优方法显著提升摘要性能。

Conclusion: 研究为政治观点摘要的可靠评估和方法开发提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

TL;DR: VSMRC是一个越南语文本分割和阅读理解数据集，填补了越南语NLP任务的资源空白。实验表明，多语言模型（如mBERT）在越南语任务中表现优于单语模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南语作为全球第20大语言，缺乏高质量的NLP资源，尤其是文本分割和阅读理解任务。VSMRC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 数据集来自越南语维基百科，包含15,942份文本分割文档和16,347个人工质量保证的多选题问答对。

Result: mBERT在阅读理解任务中准确率达88.01%，文本分割任务中F1得分为63.15%，表现优于单语模型。

Conclusion: 多语言模型在越南语NLP任务中表现优异，VSMRC为其他资源匮乏语言提供了潜在应用参考。

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native
speakers, lacks robust resources for key natural language processing tasks such
as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,
ensuring a reliable and diverse resource. Experiments show that mBERT
consistently outperforms monolingual models on both tasks, achieving an
accuracy of 88.01% on MRC test set and an F1 score of 63.15\% on text
segmentation test set. Our analysis reveals that multilingual models excel in
NLP tasks for Vietnamese, suggesting potential applications to other
under-resourced languages. VSMRC is available at HuggingFace

### [10] [Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15981)
*Markus Frohmann,Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal,Markus Schedl,Elena V. Epure*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态、模块化的晚期融合方法DE-detect，结合音频中的歌词转录和语音特征，以更鲁棒地检测AI生成的音乐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的快速发展对音乐行业带来挑战，现有检测方法（基于音频或歌词）存在局限性，需要更可靠的检测方法。

Method: 提出多模态、模块化的晚期融合管道，结合自动转录的歌词和音频中的语音特征，直接从音频中提取歌词相关信息。

Result: 实验表明，DE-detect优于现有基于歌词的检测器，且对音频扰动更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DE-detect为实际场景中检测AI生成音乐提供了有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at

### [11] [From General to Targeted Rewards: Surpassing GPT-4 in Open-Ended Long-Context Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16024)
*Zhihan Guo,Jiele Wu,Wenqian Cui,Yifei Zhang,Minda Hu,Yufei Wang,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProxyReward是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于提升大语言模型在开放长文本生成任务中的性能，通过自动生成数据集和针对性奖励信号，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放长文本生成任务缺乏高质量参考数据，现有方法仅依赖通用评估信号，限制了准确性。

Method: 提出ProxyReward框架，包括自动生成数据集的方法和针对信息全面性与准确性的奖励信号计算。

Result: ProxyReward在Open-LTG任务中性能提升20%，超越GPT-4-Turbo和LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Conclusion: ProxyReward为提升大语言模型处理复杂开放问题的能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

Method: 训练了100多个1B和4B参数的模型，评估上游（语言建模）和下游（问题解决）能力，包括领域内外泛化。

Result: 发现预训练和后续训练的收益递减、领域特定继续预训练的重要性，以及监督微调和强化学习的复杂权衡。

Conclusion: EvoLM为语言模型训练动态提供了系统分析工具，并公开了所有资源以促进开放研究和可重复性。

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

tailored for complex question answering tasks, addressing challenges in
multi-hop reasoning and contextual understanding across lengthy documents.
Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with
advanced context fusion and multi-hop reasoning mechanisms, enabling more
accurate and coherent response generation. A joint optimization strategy
combining retrieval likelihood and generation cross-entropy improves the
model's robustness and adaptability. Experimental results show that the
proposed system outperforms existing retrieval-augmented and generative
baselines, confirming its effectiveness in delivering precise, contextually
grounded answers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling通过并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架，提升大语言模型性能，无需外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间扩展方法依赖外部验证器或未优化实际计算约束，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出DynScaling，结合并行-顺序采样策略和基于多臂老虎机的动态预算分配框架。

Result: 实验表明，DynScaling在任务性能和计算成本上均优于现有无验证器基线。

Conclusion: DynScaling有效解决了实际资源约束下的性能提升问题，无需外部验证器。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络欺凌对青少年影响巨大（影响约54.4%的青少年），需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 采用改进的DeBERTa模型（加入Squeeze-and-Excitation模块和情感分析）与Gated Broad Learning System（GBLS）分类器结合。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优异：HateXplain（79.3%）、SOSNet（95.41%）、Mendeley-I（91.37%）、Mendeley-II（94.67%）。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅性能优越，还具备解释性机制，为未来网络欺凌检测系统提供了改进方向。

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是明确更深层的Transformer模型在哪些能力上有所提升，并通过形式化方法验证其表达能力。

Method: 方法包括理论证明（将Transformer与C-RASP程序等价性关联）和实证研究（验证无位置编码的Transformer在序列任务上的表现）。

Result: 结果表明，更深层的Transformer在表达能力上更强，且理论预测与实证结果一致。

Conclusion: 结论是更深层的Transformer确实具有更强的表达能力，且理论框架能有效预测其性能。

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

*Duc Hieu Ho,Chenglin Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自批判引导的好奇心精炼提示策略，通过无需额外训练的方式提升大语言模型的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现强大，但其输出的诚实性和帮助性仍存在问题。

Method: 结合自批判步骤和精炼步骤，扩展了好奇心驱动提示策略，并在HONESET数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在所有测试模型中均提升了H²分数（1.4%至4.3%），减少了低质量回答，增加了高质量回答。

Conclusion: 结构化自精炼是一种可扩展且无需训练的策略，能有效提升大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于MURIL架构的Hinglish文本网络欺凌检测框架，在多个数据集上表现优于现有多语言模型，并提供了可解释性分析和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字通信平台的增长，网络欺凌事件增多，尤其是代码混合的Hinglish文本对现有单语检测系统提出了挑战。

Method: 使用MURIL架构，结合选择性层冻结、分类头设计和专门预处理方法，提升检测性能。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，MURIL模型优于RoBERTa和IndicBERT，准确率提升1.36至13.07个百分点。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了Hinglish文本的检测问题，但未来需解决语境依赖、文化理解和跨语言讽刺检测等挑战。

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

TL;DR: FinCoT是一种结构化思维链提示方法，结合金融领域专家知识，显著提升大语言模型在金融NLP任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融NLP中结构化思维链提示的研究不足，且现有方法多基于非领域专家的启发式设计。

Method: 提出FinCoT，对比标准提示、非结构化思维链提示和结构化思维链提示，并在CFA风格问题上评估。

Result: FinCoT将性能从63.2%提升至80.5%，并减少生成标记数量八倍。

Conclusion: 领域对齐的结构化提示能提升性能、降低推理成本，并生成更可解释的专家对齐推理轨迹。

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs internalize language-specific reasoning biases, as shown by attention patterns and performance differences in Chinese and English causal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs internalize the habitual logical structures embedded in different languages, as suggested by linguistic relativity.

Method: Introduce BICAUSE, a bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, and analyze LLMs' attention patterns, performance, and representations in Chinese and English.

Result: LLMs show typologically aligned attention patterns, language-specific causal word order preferences, and semantically aligned abstractions when reasoning succeeds.

Conclusion: LLMs mimic and internalize reasoning biases shaped by language, empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法常忽视LLM的校准能力，而本文旨在通过特定提示和不确定性分数优化LLM的校准效能。

Method: SGIC框架利用不确定性分数评估文档相关性和LLM响应置信度，并通过迭代重新评分结合先前响应优化校准。此外，提出了一种构建自校准训练集的新方法。

Result: SGIC框架显著提升了闭源和开源LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 通过自引导迭代校准框架，LLM在多轮校准中的表现得到显著提升，证明了不确定性分数在优化校准中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: 弱标注数据可用于构建低资源语言的语音到文本翻译系统，且效果接近大规模基线。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Motivation: 当前自动口语评估系统在多方面评估中未能充分利用内容相关性，且语法分析过于表面化，缺乏详细的错误类型识别。

Method: 引入两个新模块：1) 多面相关性模块，整合问题、图像内容、范例和口语回答；2) 细粒度语法错误特征模块，利用高级语法纠错技术和详细标注。

Result: 实验和消融研究表明，这些模块显著提升了内容相关性、语言使用和整体评估性能。

Conclusion: 通过更丰富、更细致的特征集，实现了更全面的口语评估。

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全评估和调节工具主要偏向英语和高资源语言，导致全球多数语言未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，专注于波兰语的安全分类。

Method: 研究团队手动标注了一个波兰语安全分类基准数据集，并创建了对抗性扰动样本。实验评估了三种模型（Llama-Guard-3-8B、基于HerBERT的分类器和PLLuM）在不同数据组合下的性能。

Result: 基于HerBERT的分类器在对抗条件下表现最优，尤其是在对抗性扰动样本上的鲁棒性最强。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对特定语言（如波兰语）优化的模型在安全分类任务中表现更优，为多语言安全评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

Motivation: 评估MFC框架在非美国文化背景（巴西新闻）中的适用性，探索跨文化框架使用的挑战。

Method: 通过多轮标注巴西葡萄牙语新闻数据集FrameNews-PT，评估MFC框架的泛化能力，并测试微调和零样本模型在域外数据上的表现。

Result: MFC框架基本适用，但需调整指南；部分框架使用较少，新问题需依赖通用框架。

Conclusion: 跨文化框架使用需谨慎，MFC框架需根据文化背景调整。

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,

Result: 性能优于现有端到端生成模型，尤其在长尾关系和大规模场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确高效的信息抽取技术提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够表示现实世界内容，以及如何通过结构对应性理论解释其表示能力。

Method: 采用结构对应性理论分析LLMs的表示能力，并探讨其任务表现与结构对应性的关系。

Result: 仅结构对应性不足以支持LLMs表示现实世界内容，但若这些对应性在任务表现中起关键作用，则可能支持。

Conclusion: LLMs的文本局限性可能阻碍其表示现实世界内容，但通过任务表现的解释，结构对应性可能成为表示的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS系统在控制副语言信息（如音色、情感、韵律）时灵活性不足，且缺乏高质量基准和自动评估指标。

Method: 提出InstructTTSEval基准，包含三个任务（声学参数指定、描述性风格指令、角色扮演），共6k测试用例，并利用Gemini作为自动评估工具。

Result: 评估显示现有指令驱动TTS系统仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval有望推动更强大、灵活和准确的指令驱动TTS系统发展。

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced
in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain
adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in
LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and
annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A
key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how
contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning,
and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further
detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess
evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context
reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we
highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for
LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide
researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

TL;DR: RiOT是一种新型自动提示优化框架，通过文本梯度和树结构解决多样性不足和语义漂移问题，实验证明其优于现有方法和手动提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在多样性不足和语义漂移问题，限制了探索创新方向和多任务性能。

Method: RiOT通过迭代文本梯度生成多样化候选提示，利用困惑度选择最佳提示，并引入文本残差连接减少语义漂移，树结构管理优化过程。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，RiOT在常识、数学、逻辑、时间和语义推理任务上表现优于现有方法和手动提示。

Conclusion: RiOT通过多样化生成和语义保留机制，显著提升了自动提示优化的效果，具有可扩展性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

*Yao Lu,Zhaiyuan Ji,Jiawei Du,Yu Shanqing,Qi Xuan,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AutoAnnotator框架，结合LLMs和SLMs的多模型协作标注，降低标注成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在大规模标注中的高成本和低准确性问题，特别是在细粒度语义理解任务中。

Method: 设计双层框架：上层元控制器层（LLMs）选择SLMs、生成代码和验证样本；下层任务专家层（SLMs）通过多模型投票标注，并利用强化学习持续优化SLMs。

Result: AutoAnnotator在零样本、少样本等场景下优于现有方法，标注成本降低74.15%，准确率提高6.21%。

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator为高效、低成本的大规模标注提供了新范式。

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

Motivation: 现有代码基准测试无法全面评估大型语言模型在竞赛级代码推理上的能力。

Method: 引入OJBench，包含232个NOI和ICPC编程竞赛问题，对37种模型进行全面评估。

Result: 即使是先进的推理导向模型（如o4-mini和Gemini-2.5-pro-exp）在竞赛级问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 竞赛级代码推理对模型仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长文本时面临的挑战，尤其是跨块依赖、模型噪声和聚合噪声等问题。

Method: 提出理论框架，将长上下文任务的失败模式分类，并通过多智能体分块处理（将长序列分成小块并聚合结果）进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明多智能体分块处理在检索、问答和摘要等任务中有效，且较弱模型通过分块处理可以超越更先进模型（如GPT4o）的单次处理效果。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，论文为长上下文处理提供了原则性框架，并指出分块和聚合策略是有效途径。

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出REIS系统，通过优化存储内处理（ISP）技术，显著提升检索增强生成（RAG）中检索阶段的性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）因静态训练数据导致的知识局限问题，同时优化检索阶段的瓶颈，减少数据移动开销。

Method: 提出REIS系统，采用三种机制：优化数据库布局、ISP定制数据放置技术、利用存储系统内现有计算资源。

Result: 相比服务器级系统，REIS平均提升检索性能13倍，能效55倍。

Conclusion: REIS为RAG中的检索瓶颈提供了高效解决方案，显著提升性能和能效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

TL;DR: 论文提出StoryWriter框架，通过多智能体协作解决长故事生成的连贯性和复杂性挑战，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长故事生成存在连贯性和复杂性挑战，现有大型语言模型难以应对。

Method: 提出StoryWriter框架，包含大纲、规划和写作三个智能体模块，分别负责生成事件大纲、详细规划和动态写作。

Result: StoryWriter在故事质量和长度上显著优于基线，并生成了6000篇高质量长故事数据集。

Conclusion: StoryWriter框架及其衍生模型在长故事生成中表现出先进性能。

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论对社会媒体平台构成严峻挑战，现有研究多关注显式有害言论，而缺乏对隐式仇恨的通用检测方法。

Method: 方法包括三个关键步骤：影响力样本识别、重新标注和利用Llama-3 70B与GPT-4o进行数据增强。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，为未来研究提供了通用性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

TL;DR: RELIC是一种新颖的上下文学习框架，用于低资源印度语言中的奖励建模，通过选择高资源语言的上下文示例显著提升奖励模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多语言奖励模型主要基于高资源语言的偏好数据训练，导致对低资源印度语言的奖励信号不可靠，而收集这些语言的大规模高质量偏好数据成本过高。

Method: RELIC训练一个检索器，通过成对排序目标从高资源语言中选择最能区分偏好和非偏好响应的上下文示例。

Result: 在三个偏好数据集上的实验表明，RELIC显著提升了低资源印度语言的奖励模型准确性，例如在Bodo语言上比零样本提示和现有方法分别提高了12.81%和10.13%。

Conclusion: RELIC为解决低资源语言奖励建模问题提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统因训练数据偏向主流语言而难以识别区域方言，区域偏见研究不足，纽卡斯尔英语方言作为典型案例被选为研究对象。

Method: 采用两阶段分析：1）手动错误分析，识别语音、词汇和句法错误；2）案例研究，系统分析方言代词“yous”和“wor”的识别情况。

Result: ASR错误与区域方言特征直接相关，社会因素影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议增加ASR训练数据的方言多样性，并强调社会语言学分析在诊断和解决区域偏见中的价值。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络语音识别模型需持续吸收新数据而无需重新训练，但在无排练、多语言和语言无关条件下易导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 受人类大脑通过醒睡周期学习和巩固知识的启发，提出两阶段方法：因子化学习知识，中心化合并知识。

Result: 实验表明，中心化阶段通过低秩适配器有效防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言代码切换数据集中表现良好，能有效积累知识。

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

Motivation: 评估LLM是否具备世界模型对高风险应用中的可靠性至关重要，现有基准无法直接衡量其内部理解的稳定性。

Method: 提出新评估方法，将模型响应变异性分解为用户目的、用户表达和模型不稳定性三部分，量化语义基础。

Result: 较大模型在用户目的变化时表现更稳健，但优势有限且领域不一致。

Conclusion: 需超越准确性基准，采用语义诊断直接评估模型内部世界模型的结构和稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a
structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond
surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in
high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

### [49] [Modeling Public Perceptions of Science in Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16622)
*Jiaxin Pei,Dustin Wright,Isabelle Augenstin,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于建模公众对科学新闻的感知，并通过大规模数据集和NLP模型预测公众反应。研究发现，科学新闻的消费频率是感知的主要驱动因素，而感知分数与公众参与度直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学传播中公众感知的复杂性日益增加，需要一种系统化的方法来预测和理解公众对科学信息的反应。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，建模公众感知的12个维度，并创建了一个包含10,489条注释的大规模数据集。进一步训练NLP模型预测感知分数。

Result: 科学新闻消费频率是感知的主要驱动因素，人口统计因素影响较小。感知分数与Reddit上的公众参与度（评论和点赞）显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了感知建模在科学传播中的重要性，为预测公众兴趣和参与提供了新途径。

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

### [50] [Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16628)
*Jianlin Shi,Brian T. Bucher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）辅助开发基于规则的NLP系统的新方法，显著提高了开发效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和LLM有进展，但基于规则的NLP系统因其可解释性和操作效率仍在临床中使用，但其开发和维护成本高。

Method: 在规则系统开发阶段使用LLM，实验聚焦于从临床笔记中提取相关片段和关键词。

Result: 实验显示高召回率（Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99）和关键词提取准确率（1.0）。

Conclusion: 该方法为NLP开发提供了新方向，比深度学习方案更快、更经济且透明。

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多模态推理任务GeoGuess，通过结合视觉层次信息和地理知识进行位置识别和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务在多模态推理中对不同粒度层次视觉线索的推理能力评估不足，GeoGuess旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了SightSense方法，结合视觉层次信息和外部知识进行多模态、多层次推理。

Result: 实验表明SightSense在GeoGuess任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoGuess任务和SightSense方法为多模态推理提供了新的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

*Pavlo Vasylenko,Marcos Treviso,André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏注意力机制ASEntmax，通过可学习的温度参数实现注意力分布的稀疏与稠密切换，结合位置编码设计，显著提升了长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的softmax注意力机制在长序列任务中会分散注意力概率，导致性能下降，需要一种能精确聚焦固定大小模式的稀疏注意力方法。

Method: 引入ASEntmax稀疏注意力机制，结合可学习温度参数和优化的位置编码设计，实现注意力分布的动态调整。

Result: ASEntmax在长上下文泛化任务中显著优于softmax、scalable softmax和固定温度α-entmax基线。

Conclusion: ASEntmax通过稀疏注意力机制和位置编码优化，有效解决了长序列任务中的注意力分散问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户偏好的LLM路由框架Arch-Router，通过匹配查询到用户定义的领域或动作类型，优化模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法未能充分捕捉人类主观偏好，且模型选择范围有限。

Method: 引入Arch-Router（1.5B模型），学习将查询映射到领域-动作偏好，支持动态添加新模型。

Result: 在对话数据集上表现优于顶级专有模型，实现SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Arch-Router提升了路由决策的透明性和灵活性，支持主观评价标准。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在语法处理上表现出色，但通过探测提取的语法特征无法预测其在下游任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs内部语法表示机制及其与下游任务表现的关系。

Method: 评估32个开源Transformer模型，比较探测提取的语法特征与下游语法任务表现。

Result: 探测提取的语法特征与下游语法任务表现无显著关联。

Conclusion: LLMs的潜在语法表示与可观察的下游语法行为存在明显脱节。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立法者政治意识形态对政策制定的影响。

Method: 使用LegiGPT框架，结合GPT-4和XAI技术，分析韩国立法数据。

Result: 保守派和进步派提案数量、选区规模等是立法结果的关键因素。

Conclusion: LegiGPT为理解立法动态和政策制定提供了新工具。

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonGRM是一个三阶段生成奖励模型框架，通过优化推理路径和引入新评估指标，显著提升生成奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成奖励模型（GRMs）在复杂任务中推理能力不足导致的幻觉或关键信息缺失问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1. Zero-RL生成简洁推理路径；2. 引入评估指标$R^\star$优化路径选择；3. 强化学习微调模型。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中表现优异，平均提升1.8%，超越GPT-4o达5.6%。

Conclusion: 推理感知训练和高质量理性选择对可靠偏好建模至关重要。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在大型语言模型（LLMs）中量化认知不确定性的挑战，分析了偏置对认知和随机不确定性的影响，并发现低偏置自由置信度会加剧认知不确定性的低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在开放任务中的广泛应用，准确评估认知不确定性对确保可靠结果至关重要，但随机不确定性的存在增加了量化难度。

Method: 通过视觉问答（VQA）任务实验，分析偏置对GPT-4o和Qwen2-VL模型中认知和随机不确定性的影响。

Result: 偏置在低偏置自由置信度下对两种不确定性的影响更大，且会显著低估认知不确定性（导致过度自信），但对随机不确定性的方向无显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对偏置缓解在不确定性量化中作用的理解，为开发更先进的技术提供了潜在指导。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

Conclusion: LM-SPT通过语义蒸馏和架构改进，有效解决了语音标记序列过长问题，提升了语音-语言建模性能。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

Motivation: 现实世界中的社交推理需要整合多模态信息，语言在社交环境中尤为重要。

Method: LIRAS利用多模态语言模型解析语言和视觉输入为统一符号表示，结合贝叶斯逆规划引擎进行推理。

Result: 在多个社交推理任务中，LIRAS表现优于现有模型，更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LIRAS为多模态社交推理提供了有效框架，尤其在语言和视觉结合的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

Motivation: 现有ESC数据生成方法忽视社交动态，导致模拟效果不佳。SocialSim旨在通过社交互动要素提升ESC模拟的真实性和有效性。

Method: 在寻求者侧，通过构建全面的角色库促进社交披露；在支持者侧，通过认知推理增强社交意识。基于此构建SSConv数据集。

Result: SSConv数据集质量超越众包数据，基于其训练的聊天机器人在自动和人工评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: SocialSim为ESC提供了一种可扩展的合成方法，使情感关怀更易实现。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

Motivation: 现有黑盒越狱方法易被检测且效率低，CAMO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将恶意提示分解为语义无害的视觉和文本片段，利用跨模态推理重建有害指令。

Result: CAMO在主流LVLMs上表现高效且隐蔽，具有跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制存在漏洞，需开发更先进的视觉-语言系统安全解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

Method: MIST通过迭代优化提示，保留语义意图的同时诱导有害内容，采用顺序同义词搜索和顺序确定优化策略。

Result: 在开源和闭源模型上的实验显示，MIST的攻击成功率和迁移性优于现有方法，计算效率验证了其实际可行性。

Conclusion: MIST为破解黑盒大语言模型提供了一种高效且实用的方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

*Daniel Christoph,Max Ploner,Patrick Haller,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了不同架构和大小的语言模型在样本效率上的表现，重点关注高频和低频事实的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实文本中信息呈长尾分布，模型需高效学习并记忆高频和低频事实，样本效率是关键。

Method: 通过标注训练语料中关系事实的频率，比较不同模型在不同频率事实上的表现。

Result: 多数模型在高频事实上表现相似，但在低频事实上差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型架构、大小与事实学习效率之间的关系。

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

*Antonin Berthon,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种语言瓶颈模型（LBM），通过自然语言摘要解决知识追踪（KT）中的可解释性问题，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识追踪方法依赖不透明的潜在嵌入，可解释性差；现有LLM方法可能产生不准确的预测或摘要。

Method: LBM包含一个编码器LLM生成可解释的知识摘要，和一个冻结的解码器LLM仅基于摘要重建和预测学生回答。

Result: 在算术基准和Eedi数据集上，LBM与最先进的KT和LLM方法准确性相当，但所需学生轨迹数据更少。

Conclusion: 通过语言瓶颈约束和策略优化，LBM实现了高准确性和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

Motivation: 当前基准缺乏对LLMs生成LaTeX代码能力的评估，而LaTeX在科学文档排版中至关重要。

Method: 引入TeXpert数据集，包含多难度级别的自然语言提示，用于生成LaTeX代码，并对LLMs进行深入分析。

Result: LLMs在标准基准表现优异，但在LaTeX生成中表现差，复杂度增加时准确性下降；开源模型如DeepSeek v3与闭源模型表现相当；格式化错误普遍。

Conclusion: LLMs在LaTeX生成任务中表现不足，训练数据缺乏多样性是主要原因，开源模型具有竞争力。

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,
code, and model evaluations are available at

Conclusion: 提出的架构能够有效构建和利用知识图谱，提升语言模型的个性化能力。

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM生成反馈对学习的影响，并与现有反馈方法进行比较。

Method: 分析885名学习者在七种情境课程中的表现，比较接受、拒绝或无LLM反馈的三组，使用倾向评分控制选择偏差。

Result: 两门课程中LLM反馈显著提升学习效果（效应量0.28和0.33），学习者普遍认为反馈有帮助且不影响完成时间。

Conclusion: LLM反馈是一种低成本、可扩展的学习辅助工具，适用于已有反馈系统的开放性任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基准测试通常忽略语言和视觉歧义，未能充分利用模态间的相互澄清潜力，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: MUCAR包含多语言数据集和双歧义数据集，通过视觉和文本上下文的相互澄清构建清晰解释。

Result: 对19种先进多模态模型的评估显示，它们在歧义解决能力上与人类水平存在显著差距。

Conclusion: MUCAR为未来研究提供了新的方向，推动多模态推理的边界。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 微调预训练大模型虽能提升特定任务性能，但会牺牲通用能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用持续预训练、监督微调、偏好优化和强化学习，结合精心生成的数据，训练不同规模的模型（2B、9B、72B）。

Result: 小模型优于大型通用模型，大模型在高资源语言翻译和多语言任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Tower+证明在优化特定领域（如翻译）的同时，仍能匹敌前沿模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Motivation: LLM常产生幻觉内容，CoT提示可缓解但对其检测效果的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过实验评估CoT提示对幻觉检测的影响，分析内部状态、概率分布及检测方法表现。

Result: CoT提示减少幻觉频率，但掩盖检测信号，降低检测方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理使用中的权衡，需优化CoT提示以平衡幻觉减少与检测效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

Result: PILS方法在恢复率上比现有方法提升2-3.5倍，并在跨步数测试中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 语言模型的输出概率是反转攻击的脆弱点，PILS方法为安全和隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

Motivation: 随着语言模型处理长上下文任务的增加，KV缓存的内存成本问题日益突出，现有方法存在高内存峰值和性能下降等问题，缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 提出*KV footprint*作为统一指标，评估KV缓存的内存效率；改进现有方法，使其能在预填充阶段进行KV驱逐；提出PruLong方法，优化注意力头的KV缓存保留策略。

Result: 改进后的方法显著降低了KV footprint，PruLong在保持性能的同时，比现有方法减少了12%的内存占用。

Conclusion: 论文通过统一指标和改进方法，为长上下文推理的内存优化提供了新思路，推动了未来研究的进展。

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K是一个包含3000个断言-推理问题的数据集，用于评估语言模型是否能判断一个陈述是否因果解释另一个陈述。通过评估21个先进语言模型，发现模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，且随着参数增加，模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受因果关系，但性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发CLEAR-3K数据集的动机是评估语言模型是否能区分语义相关性和真实的因果解释关系，这对于需要准确评估因果关系的应用至关重要。

Method: 通过CLEAR-3K数据集测试21个不同参数规模（0.5B至72B）的语言模型，分析其对断言-推理问题的表现。

Result: 语言模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，参数增加导致模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受，但性能（MCC）最高仅0.55。

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K为开发和评估语言模型的真实因果推理能力提供了关键基准，尽管当前模型表现有限。

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to
inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap是一个用于个性化图标题生成的多模态数据集，通过结合图像和文本信息提升标题生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图标题通常需要作者修改以适应个人风格和领域风格，而当前的语言模型个性化技术多限于纯文本场景，缺乏多模态输入和配置的支持。

Method: 提出LaMP-Cap数据集，包含目标图像及其相关图像、标题和段落作为多模态配置，用于个性化标题生成。

Result: 实验表明，使用多模态配置信息能显著提升标题生成质量，其中图像比段落更有效。

Conclusion: 多模态配置优于纯文本配置，为个性化图标题生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Motivation: 探讨图像引导在点云补全任务中的必要性，并提出一种无需图像输入的高效方法。

Method: 采用注意力驱动的多分支编码器-解码器网络，通过跨注意力和自注意力层实现信息融合。

Result: 在ShapeNet-ViPC数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态学习在点云补全中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注视觉语言模型（VLMs）的准确性，而效率鲁棒性研究不足，且评估方法不切实际。

Method: 提出VLMInferSlow方法，结合细粒度效率建模和零阶优化，生成对抗样本以测试效率鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，VLMInferSlow生成的对抗图像可增加计算成本高达128.47%。

Conclusion: 该研究呼吁社区关注VLMs的效率鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法依赖预训练模型，但存在动态视角适应性差、未微调模型性能有限、微调成本高的问题。

Method: 提出WPCL方法，通过弱监督部分对比学习，将预训练VLM知识有效整合到感知过程中。

Result: 实验表明，WPCL在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，验证了其有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: WPCL在提升VLN任务性能的同时，确保了计算效率，为动态视角下的物体识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前技术在密集城市交通中难以精确导航，而3D场景重建的边界精度不足，符号距离函数（SDF）因其高效存储特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 结合LiDAR数据和深度神经网络，开发了一种学习型的3D场景重建方法，生成静态SDF地图。

Result: 初步结果显示，该方法能显著提升碰撞检测性能，尤其在拥挤和动态环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法为密集交通环境中的3D障碍物重建提供了更高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

Method: 使用HDEN网络分类雾密度，动态路由至三个CORUN分支，结合自适应损失平衡物理模型和感知保真度。

Result: 在Cityscapes和RTTS基准上，PSNR提升2.1 dB，FADE减少30%，目标检测mAP提高13点，推理时间减少20%。

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze证明了密度特定处理和与下游视觉任务无缝集成的重要性。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用需要多镜头生成且保持身份一致性和内容可控性，而现有方法局限于单镜头生成。

Method: 提出EchoShot框架，采用镜头感知位置嵌入机制，直接在多镜头视频数据上训练，无需额外计算开销。

Result: EchoShot在多镜头肖像视频生成中表现出优异的身份一致性和属性级可控性。

Conclusion: EchoShot可作为通用多镜头视频建模的基础范式。

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊纸草文献的背景通常不均匀、碎片化且变色，传统二值化方法难以处理，因此需要探索更有效的二值化技术以提升作者识别性能。

Method: 比较传统二值化方法与深度学习模型，结合自定义数据增强技术和不同模型选择标准，并在DIBCO 2019数据集上系统评估其性能。

Result: 深度学习模型结合数据增强技术表现最佳，且二值化效果与下游作者识别性能密切相关。

Conclusion: 数据增强对深度学习方法至关重要，二值化质量显著影响作者识别性能。

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI摄像头在CAV中处理隐私敏感数据时存在隐私风险，传统方法（如模糊处理）无法完全保护隐私，个体仍可能通过其他特征被追踪。

Method: 采用反馈强化学习和视觉语言模型，将图像转换为语义等效的文本描述，并通过分层RL策略迭代优化文本生成。

Result: 评估结果显示，隐私保护和文本质量显著提升，独特词数增加约77%，细节密度提升约50%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI摄像头隐私保护问题，同时保留了场景相关信息，为隐私敏感应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs是否采用类似语言模型的符号索引机制来解决视觉场景中的特征绑定问题，并解释其绑定失败的原因。

Method: 识别VLMs中支持绑定的内容无关空间索引机制，并分析绑定错误与这些机制失效的关系。

Result: 发现VLMs通过符号化机制实现绑定，绑定错误直接源于这些机制的失效。

Conclusion: 揭示了VLMs中符号化处理的机制，为改进其绑定失败提供了方向。

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86

0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法因模型能力有限和训练数据不足，无法完全去除摩尔纹或产生过度平滑结果；生成模型虽擅长线性退化恢复，但对非线性问题效果不佳且易引入伪影。

Method: 提出混合MAP框架，包含两部分：1）增强的监督学习模型（带线性注意力TTT模块），直接学习RAW-to-sRGB的非线性映射；2）截断流匹配先验（TFMP），通过对齐干净图像分布细化输出，恢复高频细节并抑制伪影。

Result: 框架结合了线性注意力的计算效率和生成模型的细化能力，显著提升了恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了非线性去摩尔纹问题，兼具高效性和高质量恢复能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

Result: VideoSync在公平实验条件下优于现有方法，CNN模型在同步偏移预测中表现最佳。

Conclusion: VideoSync提高了视频同步的通用性和鲁棒性，适用于更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决源域和目标域属于完全不同模态时无监督域适应方法的局限性。

Method: 提出LSB框架，采用双分支架构，结合特征一致性损失和域对齐损失。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LSB框架有效解决了跨模态域适应问题，具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jingwei Zhang,Xi Han,Hong Qin,Mahdi S. Hosseini,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBMamba通过局部双向扫描优化Mamba模型，减少计算负担，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型因单向性限制全局信息获取，双向扫描虽解决但增加计算成本。

Method: 提出LBMamba，嵌入轻量级局部反向扫描于前向扫描中，避免额外计算。

Result: LBVim在多个数据集上性能提升，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: LBMamba有效平衡性能与计算效率，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

Result: 方法在多种基线对比中表现优异，并通过消融实验验证了各组件的作用。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅将显微镜图像纳入分析，还将其性能提升至可信赖水平。

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

TL;DR: SignViP是一个新的手语视频生成框架，通过多细粒度条件提升生成质量，采用离散标记化和扩散模型实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一粗粒度条件（如骨架序列），限制了生成视频的自然性和表现力，SignViP旨在通过多细粒度条件克服这些限制。

Method: SignViP包含三个核心组件：1）联合训练的视频扩散模型和多条件编码器；2）FSQ自编码器压缩连续嵌入为离散标记；3）多条件标记翻译器将文本翻译为离散标记。

Result: SignViP在视频质量、时间一致性和语义保真度上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SignViP通过多细粒度条件和离散标记化显著提升了手语视频生成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Motivation: VPR系统在对抗攻击下缺乏防御能力，可能导致机器人导航灾难性后果，因此需要研究如何提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 分析了四种常见对抗攻击和四种VPR特有攻击，提出结合AAD的闭环系统框架，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，加入AAD可显著提升性能（如沿轨定位误差降低50%），并首次研究了FGSM攻击在VPR中的效果。

Conclusion: AAD对提升VPR系统的可信导航至关重要，研究结果为系统设计提供了定量要求。

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

Conclusion: 提出的多步微调框架有效解决了内窥镜场景中的光照和纹理问题，显著提升了深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

Motivation: 视觉生成中注意力机制的二次复杂度导致高计算和内存成本，现有稀疏化和量化方法在低密度和低比特宽度下面临挑战。

Method: 设计了Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)技术，将多样化的注意力模式统一为硬件友好的块状模式，简化稀疏化和量化。

Result: PAROAttention在低密度（20%-30%）和低比特宽度（INT8/INT4）下实现了无损性能，并带来1.9x至2.7x的端到端延迟加速。

Conclusion: PAROAttention通过重新组织注意力模式，有效解决了视觉生成中的计算和内存问题，同时保持了性能。

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

Conclusion: STAR-Pose通过任务导向的超分辨率设计，显著提升了低分辨率视频中的姿态估计效率和精度。

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

Result: 在LRW和LRW-1000数据集上，TD3Net性能优于现有TCN架构，参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: TD3Net有效利用多样时间特征，保持时间连续性，为唇读系统提供显著优势。

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook2数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 显式先验显著提升了密集视频描述任务的性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Result: AutoV显著提升多种LVLMs在图像理解任务中的表现，如LLaVA-OV和Qwen2.5-VL。

Conclusion: AutoV是一种高效的视觉提示优化方法，适用于多种LVLMs。

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化噪声提升时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit训练了一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化后的噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升了视频生成的质量和时间一致性，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GRPO-CARE框架，通过双重奖励机制提升多模态大语言模型的推理一致性和答案准确性，并在SEED-Bench-R1基准上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中缺乏严格的评估，且存在推理步骤与答案逻辑不一致的问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-CARE框架，结合基础答案正确性奖励和自适应一致性奖励，替代KL惩罚，优化推理一致性和答案正确性。

Result: GRPO-CARE在SEED-Bench-R1上表现优于标准GRPO，性能提升6.7%，一致性提高24.5%，并展示出强迁移能力。

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE为MLLMs提供了一种可推广的后训练框架，提升了模型的解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对Referring Expression Segmentation（RES）模型的多模态双向攻击方法，通过联合优化图像和文本模态，增强对抗样本的跨文本迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RES模型在对抗样本的鲁棒性方面研究不足，现有攻击方法难以揭示其多模态结构的脆弱性，且实际应用中需要对抗样本能适应多样化的文本输入。

Method: 提出Multimodal Bidirectional Attack，结合可学习的代理文本嵌入扰动，联合优化图像和文本模态，生成更具通用性的对抗样本。

Result: 在多个RES模型和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，显著提升了对抗样本的跨文本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RES模型在多模态对抗攻击中的挑战，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: GAP框架成功解决了远程生理测量中的泛化与个性化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic
monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance
systems into emergency management systems.

Method: 提出一种流程，利用低分辨率鸟瞰占用网格视频训练视频生成模型，并通过单帧目标检测和帧间目标匹配提取轨迹数据。

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法在性能与鲁棒性之间存在权衡，尤其在分布外数据上表现不佳，限制了实际应用。

Method: FOCoOp利用三类提示（全局、局部、OOD）实现类级和分布级分离，并通过双层分布鲁棒优化适应OOD变化。

Result: 实验表明FOCoOp能有效捕捉分布式异构数据并增强OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCoOp填补了联邦提示学习在OOD鲁棒性上的空白，提升了实际场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）通常假设输入为高质量多视角图像，难以应对现实中的噪声、模糊、低分辨率等问题。3D LLV旨在将2D低层视觉任务扩展到3D空间，提升模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 综述展示了如何在恶劣条件下实现高保真3D重建，并讨论了自动驾驶、AR/VR等应用领域。

Conclusion: 3D LLV是提升现实环境中3D内容生成和场景重建鲁棒性的重要方向。

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于TLS的滑坡监测提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于其他点云和监测任务。

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

Motivation: 现有FGIR方法容易过拟合训练数据，忽略预训练知识，泛化能力不足。

Method: 设计对象感知适应和上下文适应，调整输入样本和特征，同时通过知识蒸馏传递判别知识。

Result: DVA在多个数据集上表现优异，参数更少。

Conclusion: DVA有效平衡了检索效率和性能，提升了FGIR的泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉在无明确训练下能高效分割视觉线索，而现有AI算法在噪声增加时性能下降明显。SyncMapV2旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于自组织动力学方程和随机网络概念，无需鲁棒训练、监督或损失函数。

Result: 在数字噪声、天气和模糊等干扰下，SyncMapV2性能下降极小（如噪声下仅7.3% vs SOTA的37.7%）。

Conclusion: SyncMapV2首次实现在线自适应分割，为未来鲁棒自适应智能算法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Conclusion: MADNet通过多尺度自适应双域设计，显著提升了图像去噪效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

Conclusion: RealDriveSim为自动驾驶提供了高质量、低成本的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: As perception models continue to develop, the need for large-scale datasets
increases. However, data annotation remains far too expensive to effectively
scale and meet the demand. Synthetic datasets provide a solution to boost model
performance with substantially reduced costs. However, current synthetic
datasets remain limited in their scope, realism, and are designed for specific
tasks and applications. In this work, we present RealDriveSim, a realistic
multi-modal synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that not only supports
popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts,
providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively
evaluate our dataset for a wide range of applications and domains,
demonstrating state-of-the-art results compared to existing synthetic
benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: DETA++通过去噪和鲁棒性设计，显著提升了小样本学习在噪声环境中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Result: 像素级显著性图表现优于点特异性显著性图，适合支持法医专家。

Conclusion: 像素级显著性图在笔迹识别和验证中更具实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

Conclusion: MambaHash在大规模图像检索任务中具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）处理大量令牌时计算需求高，限制了其在医学图像分析中的实际应用。

Method: 通过提示引导的空间先验对令牌按相关性排序，剪枝低相关性令牌，仅处理相关令牌。

Result: 实验显示令牌减少35-55%，计算成本降低，分割精度保持。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境中实现高效医学图像处理，支持实时诊断。

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注车与车、车与基础设施的协同感知，而忽视了无人机提供的动态俯视视角。缺乏高质量的空中-地面协同数据集是主要原因。

Method: 通过两辆配备多摄像头和LiDAR的车辆及一架配备摄像头和LiDAR的无人机，采集了120K LiDAR帧和440K图像数据，覆盖14种驾驶场景。

Result: 数据集包含400个场景，每个场景约100帧，标注了13类物体的3D边界框，并提供了动态交互事件的丰富数据。

Conclusion: AGC-Drive为空中-地面协同感知研究提供了重要资源，并开源了工具包，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

Result: 在iMiGUE数据集上取得61.82%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: CLIP-MG展示了潜力，但完全适应CLIP等视觉语言模型于微手势识别仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

TL;DR: HyperPath利用双曲空间建模WSI的语义层次结构，结合视觉和文本特征，通过几何感知方法提升WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖欧几里得嵌入，难以充分捕捉WSI的语义层次结构，限制了分类性能。

Method: 提出HyperPath，在双曲空间中结合视觉和文本特征，设计角度模态对齐损失和语义层次一致性损失，利用测地距离进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，HyperPath在多个任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 双曲嵌入在WSI分析中具有潜力，能有效提升语义层次建模和分类性能。

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Motivation: 现有VDU系统在对抗扰动下的鲁棒性研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出统一框架，结合OCR边界框、像素和文本的扰动，约束布局预算以保持合理性，使用PGD优化边界框扰动。

Result: 在四个数据集和六种模型上，行级攻击和复合扰动导致性能下降最显著，PGD边界框扰动优于随机基线。

Conclusion: 布局预算、文本修改和对抗迁移性对攻击效果有显著影响，为VDU系统的鲁棒性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

Conclusion: WHT是一种高效且有效的方法，适用于能耗受限的CNN应用。

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the
trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and
classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100
dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late
layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ
per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat

acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集在雪天和晴朗天气下的标注数据不足，或依赖去雪方法生成合成数据，缺乏真实性和引入额外域偏移。

Method: 扩展CADC数据集，通过配对同一道路和时期的晴朗天气序列，创建CADC+数据集，减少非雪因素的域偏移。

Result: 雪引入了随机和认知不确定性，既作为噪声又作为独特数据域。

Conclusion: CADC+为评估雪对3D物体检测的影响提供了更真实的数据基础。

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在卒中分诊中依赖真实患者数据引发的隐私和伦理挑战。

Method: 利用预训练视频运动转移模型将患者面部运动特征映射到合成身份上，并通过条件生成模型调整输入空间以确保准确运动转移。

Result: SafeTriage生成的合成视频有效保留了卒中相关面部模式，同时提供强大的隐私保护。

Conclusion: SafeTriage为神经疾病数据共享和AI临床分析提供了安全且伦理合规的基础。

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

Motivation: 传统不确定性评估指标忽略空间上下文和结构信息，无法区分不同模式的不确定性（如分散与边界对齐）。

Method: 提出三种结合结构和边界信息的空间感知指标，并在前列腺分区分割挑战数据上验证。

Result: 新指标与临床重要因素更一致，能更好区分有意义和虚假的不确定性模式。

Conclusion: 空间感知指标在医学图像分割中更有效，提升不确定性评估的临床相关性。

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Motivation: 解决图像质量评估中主观感知和复杂失真的挑战。

Conclusion: MetaQAP为无参考IQA提供了鲁棒且通用的框架，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Learngene方法在多模态场景中通用知识提取的不足，提升模型效率和性能。

Method: 使用多模态和单模态块加权提取通用知识，初始化不同规模和模态的模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能优于现有方法（如Oxford-IIIT PET和Flickr30k），同时减少25%参数存储和2.8倍预训练成本。

Conclusion: MM-LG高效且性能优越，适合多下游任务部署。

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: 条纹结构对抗补丁具有实际应用价值，可用于立体系统的安全评估。

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型存在视觉语言集成效率低的问题，限制了可扩展性和效率。

Method: LaVi通过轻量级自适应变换，在层归一化的仿射参数中注入视觉条件增量，避免长上下文扩展。

Result: 在15个图像和视频基准测试中，LaVi实现了最先进的多模态性能，FLOPs减少94.0%，推理速度提升3.1倍，内存使用减半。

Conclusion: LaVi是一种可扩展且实用的实时多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

Conclusion: 通过引入语言驱动的常识先验，显著提升了遮挡严重视频动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: FSGCD框架在已知信息稀缺条件下显著提升了GCD任务的性能。

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

Result: 实验表明，TeSG在下游任务（如检测和分割）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TeSG通过多级语义引导显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的效果，尤其在任务驱动场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 3DeepRep通过多方向低秩表示和自监督优化，显著提升了高光谱图像修复的性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上，CoDAF的mAP达到78.6%。

Conclusion: CoDAF通过统一的设计实现了鲁棒的无人机目标检测，实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF
achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督ViT的分层特征子集检测方法，用于图像实例搜索，解决了对象嵌入和遮挡问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度特征在图像检索中表现良好，但实例级特征表示不足，且监督方法对未知类别效果不佳。

Method: 利用自监督ViT输出的特征集，通过分层方式检测紧凑特征子集，形成层次结构，节点对应不同语义尺度的实例区域。

Result: 在三个实例搜索基准测试中显著优于现有方法，对已知和未知类别均有效。

Conclusion: 分层分解方法能有效解决对象嵌入和遮挡问题，提供全面的实例级描述符。

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的红外与可见光图像融合方法INRFuse，通过神经网络参数化连续函数，实现多模态信息的自适应融合，无需训练数据集即可生成高质量融合图像。


<details>

Motivation: 结合红外与可见光图像的优势，生成信息丰富且满足视觉或计算需求的融合图像，突破传统方法对离散像素或显式特征的依赖。

Method: 利用归一化空间坐标作为输入，通过多层感知机自适应融合多模态特征，设计多损失函数联合优化融合图像与原图像的相似性。

Result: 实验表明，INRFuse在主观视觉质量和客观评价指标上优于现有方法，融合图像结构清晰、细节自然、信息丰富，且支持不同分辨率图像的直接融合与超分辨率重建。

Conclusion: INRFuse通过隐式神经表示实现了高效的红外与可见光图像融合，具有分辨率无关性和无需训练数据集的优势，为多模态图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但因其依赖迭代马尔可夫链过程，导致计算和资源消耗大，且误差累积限制了压缩技术的效果。

Method: PQ采用两阶段量化，通过动量机制自适应调整位宽，减少低精度下的权重扰动；CAD利用全精度校准数据集进行蒸馏，使量化学生模型能匹配全精度性能。

Result: PQCAD-DM在计算效率和生成质量之间取得平衡，推理时间减半，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 实验验证PQCAD-DM在多样数据集上优于固定位量化方法，具备更高的生成能力和效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在理解退化图像内容方面表现不佳，导致重建结果低保真且不自然。

Method: 提出VLCoT框架模拟人类处理退化图像的过程，结合GRPO优化方法，设计四种奖励函数（格式、退化、理解和生成奖励）。

Result: 实验表明，RealSR-R1能生成更真实的细节，尤其在语义丰富或严重退化的场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: RealSR-R1通过多模态推理和优化策略，显著提升了真实世界图像超分辨率的质量。

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

Motivation: 现有视频伪造检测器泛化能力差，难以应对实际场景中的多样化生成模型。

Method: 研究不同生成架构的判别特征，设计基于小波分解的数据增强策略，引导模型关注更相关的伪造线索。

Result: 在仅用单一生成模型数据训练的情况下，检测器对多种其他生成模型的视频表现出显著更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，无需复杂算法或大规模数据集，即可显著提升检测器的泛化性能。

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Co-VisiON基准，用于评估稀疏图像集中的共可见性推理能力，发现现有视觉模型在此任务上表现不佳，尤其是与人类相比。作者提出了一种新方法Covis，缩小了与专有视觉语言模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在复杂场景中识别共可见性的能力，并评估当前视觉模型是否达到人类水平。

Method: 引入Co-VisiON基准，测试稀疏图像集的共可见性推理；提出Covis方法，基于多视图推理。

Result: 专有视觉语言模型表现最佳，但所有模型均远低于人类水平；Covis在纯视觉模型中表现最优。

Conclusion: 共可见性需要高级多视图推理，Covis展示了潜力，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉理解与编辑分离，依赖多个独立模型，无法统一处理。FOCUS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用双分支视觉编码器捕获全局语义和空间细节，结合MoVQGAN视觉标记器和多阶段训练策略，优化分割掩码作为条件提示。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优异，包括多模态理解、参考分割准确性和可控图像生成。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过联合优化视觉感知和生成能力，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Loupe的补丁级融合和条件查询设计有效提升了分类和定位性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升足球检测性能，适用于动态环境，并公开了新数据集。

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

Conclusion: AnyTraverse在自动化与人工监督之间取得平衡，适用于多样化机器人平台和复杂户外场景。

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Result: 新框架显著提高了标定精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统棋盘格标定，并提供了标定指南和开源实现。

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based multi-condition
controllable framework for video head swapping, which seamlessly transplant a
human head from a static image into a dynamic video, while preserving the
original body and background of target video, and further allowing to tweak
head expressions and movements during swapping as needed. Existing
face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在有限配对数据下构建多模态模型的方法，通过对齐预训练的单模态基础模型，仅需少量样本即可实现高质量对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量配对数据，成本高昂且难以获取，因此探索在有限数据下实现多模态对齐的可行性。

Method: 引入STRUCTURE正则化技术，保持单模态编码器的潜在空间几何结构，并优化对齐层选择。

Result: 在24个零样本分类和检索任务中，平均相对提升51.6%（分类）和91.8%（检索）。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限领域提供了高效的多模态学习框架。

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LunarLoc的全球定位方法，用于解决月球表面自主操作中的定位问题，通过实例分割提取地标并构建图表示，实现了高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于月球表面缺乏GPS等导航基础设施，传统视觉惯性里程计（VIO）在长距离任务中会累积误差，因此需要一种无漂移的全球定位方法。

Method: LunarLoc利用实例分割从立体图像中提取地标，构建图表示，并通过图论数据关联与参考地图对齐，实现定位。

Result: 实验表明，LunarLoc在多会话全球定位中达到亚厘米级精度，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LunarLoc为月球任务提供了高精度定位解决方案，并公开数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LAION-C作为ImageNet-C的替代基准，用于评估模型在web-scale数据集时代的OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如ImageNet-C）的失真类型已不再适用于web-scale数据集，导致模型在OOD泛化能力评估上出现饱和现象。

Method: 设计了六种新型失真类型构建LAION-C，并评估了包括MLLM在内的先进模型，同时通过心理物理实验比较人类与模型的鲁棒性。

Result: LAION-C对当代模型构成显著挑战，且最佳模型在OOD泛化上已接近或超越人类表现。

Conclusion: LAION-C为web-scale数据集时代的OOD鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的基准，揭示了模型性能的新范式。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

TL;DR: Defusion是一种新型的全能图像修复框架，通过视觉指令引导的退化扩散，解决了传统方法需要针对每种退化类型单独建模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像修复方法需要为每种退化类型（如去模糊、去噪、去雾）设计独立模型，限制了其在混合或未知退化场景中的泛化能力。

Method: Defusion通过构建明确的视觉指令，捕捉退化特征而不依赖图像语义，并利用这些指令引导基于扩散的模型直接在退化空间中操作，通过去噪重建高质量图像。

Result: 实验表明，Defusion在多种图像修复任务中优于现有方法，包括复杂和真实世界的退化场景。

Conclusion: Defusion提供了一种通用且稳定的图像修复解决方案，具有更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

TL;DR: ResFlow是一种基于连续归一化流的图像恢复框架，通过确定性路径建模退化过程，显著提升了性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型（如扩散和基于分数的模型）将退化过程视为随机变换，导致效率低下和复杂性增加。

Method: ResFlow将退化过程建模为确定性路径，并引入辅助过程消除HQ预测的不确定性，采用熵保持流路径和速度场匹配学习。

Result: ResFlow在少于4个采样步骤内完成图像恢复，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ResFlow为图像恢复提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在医学领域的应用仍处于早期阶段，缺乏全面的框架来搜索和评估有效的推理路径。

Method: 提出MICS方法，通过导师-实习生协作搜索生成医学推理路径数据，并构建MMRP数据集和Chiron-o1模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于MICS构建的CoT数据集训练的Chiron-o1在多个医学视觉问答和推理基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MICS方法显著提升了医学MLLMs的推理能力，为医学领域的多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present
ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise

ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx),
showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor
modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code will be

TL;DR: Prmpt2Adpt是一种轻量级、高效的零样本域适应框架，通过提示驱动的特征对齐实现快速适应，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有无监督域适应方法依赖大型模型和完整源域数据的问题，提升在资源受限环境（如无人机）中的适用性。

Method: 基于教师-学生范式，使用蒸馏和微调的CLIP模型作为Faster R-CNN教师，通过提示驱动的实例归一化（PIN）对齐特征，生成高质量伪标签指导紧凑学生模型适应。

Result: 在MDS-A数据集上表现优异，适应速度提升7倍，推理速度提升5倍，仅需少量源图像。

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt为低资源领域的实时适应提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Conclusion: 协作感知能有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，尤其在更大空间范围内优势显著。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

Motivation: 真实世界超分辨率重建依赖反映真实退化模式的数据集，但现有方法难以同时捕捉模糊和噪声等多样化退化特征。

Method: TripleGAN框架包含FirstGAN（缩小模糊域差距）、SecondGAN（学习目标域模糊特性和其他退化模式）和ThirdGAN（重建真实低分辨率图像）。

Result: 在RealSR和DRealSR数据集上，该方法在定量指标上表现优越，重建结果清晰且无过度平滑伪影。

Conclusion: TripleGAN能有效学习真实退化模式并合成对齐数据集，显著提升超分辨率重建质量。

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

Motivation: 现有特征可视化方法通常仅能推断单元最兴奋的图像，无法揭示其不变性变换的多样性，而这对视觉泛化至关重要。

Method: SnS通过双目标优化问题，分别探索保持单元激活的图像扰动和抑制单元激活的最小扰动，以研究不变性和对抗敏感性。

Result: 在卷积神经网络(CNN)中，SnS揭示了比仿射变换更远离参考图像但更保留单元响应的图像变化，且不同表征层的优化导致不同的不变性图像。

Conclusion: SnS为理解视觉系统的不变性提供了新工具，并支持鲁棒CNN作为视觉系统模型的更高保真度。

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

Conclusion: Assembler展示了在交互式和组合设计中的潜力，支持从图像生成高分辨率、可编辑的3D对象。

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we
further introduce an interesting part-aware 3D modeling system that generates
high-resolution, editable objects from images, demonstrating potential for
interactive and compositional design. Project page:

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

*Shoubin Yu,Yue Zhang,Ziyang Wang,Jaehong Yoon,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEXA是一个无需训练的框架，通过动态选择专家模型并聚合其输出，实现跨模态和任务的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态推理中因输入多样性和任务复杂性导致的统一框架构建难题。

Method: MEXA动态选择专家模型，生成可解释的文本推理输出，并通过大型推理模型（LRM）聚合结果。

Result: 在多种多模态基准测试中表现优于基线，验证了其有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MEXA通过专家驱动的选择和聚合，实现了灵活、透明的多模态推理。

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出竞争性精度和实时性能，适用于机器人、增强现实等领域。

Conclusion: RGBTrack为无需深度输入的6D姿态跟踪提供了实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation
and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for
depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building
on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,
and computer vision.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于pgSPAD成像器的数字水印技术，利用制造差异（DSNU）实现源识别和篡改检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CMOS和APS传感器的数字水印技术已有研究，但SPAD成像器尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用三个64x64 pgSPAD芯片的DSNU特性，结合标准测试图像，提出动态水印技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可实现源识别和篡改检测，并在灵敏度和鲁棒性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: pgSPAD成像器的水印技术具有潜力，为数字安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Result: 在两个多模态数据集上表现出优越性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下的医学图像分割任务中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个密度分布不同的计数数据集上优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: 条件特征对齐能有效提升跨域计数的泛化性能，理论分析和实验结果均验证了其优势。

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

Result: 实验表明，这种基于语言的方法能有效检测比赛关键事件，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为动作检测提供了一种轻量级、无需训练的替代方案，优于传统视频方法。

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Co-Seg++在语义、实例和全景分割任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Co-Seg++通过联合任务提升分割性能，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that

objects. For image time series (i.e., video or sequences of stills), tracking
objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the
output from popular object detectors and track objects over time from either
monoscopic or stereoscopic camera configurations. In addition, it includes
functionality to generate consensus detections from ensembles of object
detectors.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.

Conclusion: UniFork通过平衡共享学习与任务专业化，有效解决了模态对齐冲突。

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling

physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D

motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and

Method: 提出Mirage框架，通过潜在视觉标记与文本标记交替解码，避免显式图像生成。首先通过图像嵌入蒸馏监督潜在标记，后转为文本监督，最后通过强化学习优化多模态推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，Mirage在多种基准测试中显著提升了多模态推理能力，且无需显式图像生成。

Conclusion: Mirage通过潜在视觉标记实现了更高效的多模态推理，为VLM的视觉想象任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

Conclusion: DiffTrack为理解视频DiTs的时间机制提供了关键见解，并支持进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

### [197] [DeepRTL2: A Versatile Model for RTL-Related Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15697)
*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yunhao Zhou,Zhengyuan Shi,Changran Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: DeepRTL2是一个多功能LLM家族，首次统一了EDA中基于生成和嵌入的任务，填补了嵌入任务的研究空白，并在所有评估任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在LLM在EDA中的生成任务（如RTL代码生成），而同等重要的嵌入任务（如代码搜索、功能等价性检查）被忽视。

Method: 提出DeepRTL2模型，同时处理生成和嵌入任务，覆盖RTL相关多样化需求。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRTL2在所有任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: DeepRTL2为EDA提供了全面解决方案，填补了研究空白并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 研究分析了生成式AI（GAI）在教育中的影响，通过社交媒体数据（1,199篇Reddit帖子和13,959条评论）进行情感分析、主题建模和作者分类，提出并验证了一种基于LLM的模块化框架，其GPT-4o管道在所有任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAI在教育中的快速普及，了解学生和教育工作者的看法至关重要。

Method: 使用情感分析、主题建模和作者分类，提出并验证了一种基于LLM的模块化框架，对比了经典NLP模型。

Result: GPT-4o管道表现优异（情感分析准确率90.6%），提取了12个潜在主题，揭示了学生和教师对GAI的不同态度。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更明确的政策、透明的GAI整合实践和支持机制，并展示了LLM框架在分析在线社区话语中的潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational
landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators
perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most
comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in
education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and
13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic
modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a
modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for
analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against
classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline
consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it
achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human
annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public
discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and
students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and
productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students
often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while
teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and
institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives
highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning
environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies,
more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both
educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of
LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online
communities.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Vision Transformer（ViT）的方法，通过将NASA开普勒任务的原始光曲线数据转换为Gramian Angular Fields（GAFs）和Recurrence Plots（RPs），以提高系外行星分类的效率。结果显示，RPs表现优于GAFs，ViT模型在召回率和精确率上分别达到89.46%和85.09%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统系外行星分类方法需要大量计算和观测资源，耗时且成本高，因此需要利用先进的机器学习技术提高分类效率。

Method: 将原始光曲线数据转换为GAFs和RPs，作为ViT模型的输入，利用其捕捉复杂时间依赖的能力，并通过5折交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: ViT模型在RPs上的表现优于GAFs，召回率和精确率分别为89.46%和85.09%。

Conclusion: 尽管通过欠采样技术解决了类别不平衡问题，但数据集规模减小仍是限制。未来研究需优化模型架构以提高自动化、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in
astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources.
Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the
need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification
efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light
curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and
Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and
recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate
temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall,
precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to
obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias.
Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model
achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating
its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits.
Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset
size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of
further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation,
performance, and generalization of the model.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了通用特征编码在大模型中的应用，通过提出一种数据驱动的分布变换方法，解决了特征分布异构性问题，显著提升了压缩效率和跨模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征编码研究多针对特定任务或模型，而大模型的特征分布多样且不兼容，导致通用特征编码的挑战未被解决。

Method: 提出一种学习的峰值到平衡分布变换方法，将异构特征分布对齐到共同的目标空间，无需修改下游编码器。

Result: 在LLaMA3、DINOv2和SD3等多个大模型上验证，实验表明该方法在压缩效率和跨模型泛化上优于任务专用基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用特征编码提供了有效解决方案，未来研究可通过开源代码进一步探索。

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential
for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing
transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted
task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature
coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large
models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally
incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,
features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while
those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This
distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned
peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed
feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation
is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of
heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this
alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can
effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate
our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and
SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will
be released for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Agentic AI研究缺乏标准化，导致方法间难以公平比较，设计选择对效果的影响不明确。

Method: 在GAIA基准和BrowseComp上系统研究关键组件设计选择的影响，提出稳健评估协议。

Result: 发现缺乏标准评估协议导致结果不可复现，某些设计冗余；构建的OAgents框架达到开源项目最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估和模块化设计，OAgents推动了Agentic AI研究的未来发展。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

TL;DR: SLR是一个端到端框架，用于通过可扩展的逻辑推理系统评估和训练大语言模型（LLMs）。它能自动生成难度可控的归纳推理任务，并创建SLR-Bench基准测试。评估显示，当前LLMs在逻辑推理上表现不佳，但通过SLR调优可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在逻辑推理任务上表现不足，且缺乏自动化、可扩展的评估和训练方法。SLR旨在填补这一空白，提供无需人工标注的解决方案。

Method: SLR通过自动生成任务（包括潜在规则、验证程序和指令提示）来评估和训练LLMs。创建了包含19k提示的SLR-Bench基准测试，涵盖20个难度级别。

Result: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理上表现不佳，但通过SLR调优后，Llama-3-8B的准确率翻倍，达到与Gemini-Flash-Thinking相当的水平，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: SLR为LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了自动化、可扩展的评估和训练环境，显著提升了模型性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决AI代理在多样化人类操作者和利益相关者中适应的需求，尤其是在高风险任务场景中。

Method: 使用Sotopia模拟测试平台，通过两个实验系统评估人格特质和AI特性对谈判结果的影响，包括因果发现方法和社交认知词汇分析。

Result: 实验1发现Agreeableness和Extraversion显著影响谈判结果；实验2揭示了AI代理的透明度、能力和适应性对任务有效性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为AI代理在复杂任务中的可靠性评估提供了可重复的方法，并强调了社交动态对任务成功的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长超出了人类和AI系统的处理能力，需一种结构化方法来动态评估和更新信念。

Result: BEWA支持图结构声明传播、作者可信度建模和加密验证，提升机器推理的真理效用和完整性。

Conclusion: BEWA为动态科学领域的机器推理提供了可验证的认知网络基础。

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient
integrity across dynamic scientific domains.

TL;DR: IS-Bench是一个多模态基准测试，用于评估VLM驱动代理的交互安全性，揭示当前代理在动态风险感知和缓解能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态评估范式无法模拟动态风险，导致VLM代理在真实家庭任务中存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出IS-Bench，包含161个场景和388个风险，支持面向过程的评估，验证风险缓解步骤的顺序正确性。

Result: 实验表明当前代理缺乏交互安全意识，安全感知的Chain-of-Thought虽能提升性能，但可能影响任务完成。

Conclusion: IS-Bench为开发更安全的AI系统奠定了基础，揭示了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的内置审核系统在分析有害内容时可能拒绝执行指令或产生过度谨慎的响应，影响研究结果的效度，尤其是在分析组织冲突（如微侵犯或仇恨言论）时。

Method: 采用Elo评级方法改进LLMs的有害内容分析性能，并在微侵犯检测和仇恨言论两个数据集上进行验证。

Result: 该方法在准确性、精确度和F1分数等关键指标上优于传统LLM提示技术和传统机器学习模型，具有更高的可靠性和更少的误报。

Conclusion: 该方法为组织应用（如检测职场骚扰、评估有毒沟通）提供了更可靠和可扩展的解决方案，有助于创建更安全、包容的工作环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“安全提醒”的软提示调优方法，通过优化可学习的提示标记来增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全性，防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLM）在代码生成和聊天机器人等实际应用中的能力增强，其安全性问题日益突出。由于多模态特性，VLM面临独特的漏洞，攻击者可能通过修改视觉或文本输入绕过安全防护。

Method: 论文通过系统分析VLM在攻击下的行为，发现了一种称为“延迟安全意识”的现象。基于此，提出了“安全提醒”方法，通过周期性注入优化的提示标记来主动激活VLM的安全意识。

Result: 在三个安全基准和一个对抗攻击测试中，该方法显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了模型在正常任务中的性能。

Conclusion: “安全提醒”为实际应用中部署更安全的VLM提供了一种实用解决方案，既能防止有害内容生成，又不影响正常对话和模型性能。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a

they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

<details>

Motivation: 心理学研究中广泛使用LLMs，但人类测量工具的应用可能导致矛盾结果，甚至产生虚假现象。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出双效度框架，根据科学目标的不同调整证据要求，强调验证策略的差异性。

Result: 当前实践未能满足验证要求，常将统计模式匹配误认为心理现象的证据。

Conclusion: 未来需开发心理构念的计算类比，并建立明确的证据标准，而非盲目应用人类测量工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology,
serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and
computational models of cognition. However, the application of human
measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising
concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts
rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that
building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our
field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the
standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to
guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a
claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may
require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety
demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically
fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching
as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am
anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether
researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of
psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence
rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

Conclusion: 强调透明度和模型能力限制的重要性，为研究者提供框架以利用LLMs的独特能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological
and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article
provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two
primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse
contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive
processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically
grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for
validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible
populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we
synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,
methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating
model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including
prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and
ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.
Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and
constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence
about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and
prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage
the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.

TL;DR: TrajSceneLLM通过结合地图图像和LLM生成的文本描述，提升GPS轨迹的语义理解，显著提高了旅行模式识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以提取GPS轨迹的深层语义表示和结合地图上下文信息，因此提出多模态框架以增强语义理解。

Method: 框架整合地图图像（空间上下文）和LLM生成的文本描述（时间序列和动态），生成多模态嵌入，并搭配简单MLP分类器。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在旅行模式识别任务中的显著性能提升，减少了对手工特征的依赖。

Conclusion: TrajSceneLLM展示了在时空依赖建模和下游地理空间AI应用中的潜力。

Abstract: GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban
dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional
methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate
contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective
for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework
integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual
descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and
movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and
then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic
content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the
proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for
analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments
show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement,
highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep
spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features.
This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream
applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于抽象语法树（AST）的代码分块方法（AST-based chunking），以解决现有行分块方法破坏语义结构的问题，显著提升了代码生成任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于行的分块方法在代码检索增强生成（RAG）中常破坏语义结构（如拆分函数或合并无关代码），影响生成质量。

Method: 提出AST-based chunking方法，通过递归分解大AST节点并合并兄弟节点，生成语义连贯的分块。

Result: 在RepoEval检索任务中Recall@5提升4.3点，SWE-bench生成任务中Pass@1提升2.67点。

Conclusion: 结构感知的分块方法对提升检索增强的代码智能至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by
advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based
systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair
systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source
Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing
solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed
documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain
unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all
submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)
leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as
submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our
findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),
the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base
spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

*Liulu He,Shenli Zhen,Karwei Sun,Yijiang Liu,Yufei Zhao,Chongkang Tan,Huanrui Yang,Yuan Du,Li Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BASE-Q的新方法，通过结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，有效减少了旋转量化中的舍入和截断误差，并支持分块优化，避免了内存密集型全模型反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前旋转量化方法存在两个根本性限制：(i) 旋转未能对齐通道均值，导致量化边界变宽和舍入误差增加；(ii) 旋转使激活分布更接近高斯分布，增加了截断误差的能量损失。

Method: 提出BASE-Q方法，结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，减少误差，并支持分块优化。

Result: 实验表明，BASE-Q在多种大语言模型和基准测试中表现优异，将精度差距缩小了50.5%、42.9%和29.2%（相比QuaRot、SpinQuant和OSTQuant）。

Conclusion: BASE-Q是一种简单而强大的方法，显著提升了旋转量化的性能，同时减少了内存开销。

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS是一种基于历史注意力模式的稀疏索引加速方法，通过捕捉垂直和斜线模式，显著提升长上下文LLM的解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM支持更长上下文，KV缓存的存储需求成为瓶颈，稀疏注意力机制虽能缓解问题，但其索引计算开销大且未利用历史解码信息。

Method: LFPS动态构建稀疏索引候选，捕捉垂直和斜线模式，并采用位置扩展策略预测Top-k索引。

Result: 在LongBench-RULER基准测试中，LFPS比全注意力快22.8倍，比精确Top-k检索快9.6倍，且保持生成准确性。

Conclusion: LFPS为长上下文LLM推理提供了一种高效实用的解码优化方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的双边短时拉普拉斯变换（STLT）机制，替代传统自注意力，实现高效的长序列语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力在长序列任务中计算复杂度高，STLT通过可学习的参数动态调整衰减率和频率响应，提升模型效率和适应性。

Method: 引入可训练的拉普拉斯节点参数，结合快速递归卷积和FFT计算，动态分配节点数量，实现低复杂度计算。

Result: 在语言建模、机器翻译和长文档问答任务中表现优异，支持超过100k tokens的上下文长度。

Conclusion: STLT结合了可解释性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，为超长序列建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为daDPO（Distribution-Aware DPO）的新方法，通过结合偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，显著提升了小型语言模型的对话能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中表现下降，现有知识蒸馏方法（如dDPO）仅关注教师模型的输出，忽略了其输出分布。

Method: 提出daDPO方法，统一偏好优化和基于分布的蒸馏，并通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验显示，daDPO在修剪模型和小型LLM上表现优异，例如20%修剪的Vicuna1.5-7B接近教师性能，Qwen2.5-1.5B有时超越其7B教师模型。

Conclusion: daDPO是一种高效的方法，能够显著提升小型语言模型的对话能力，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存淘汰方法在单模态场景中表现良好，但在多模态场景中无法捕捉模态特定信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: MadaKV通过模态偏好适应和分层压缩补偿两个关键组件，动态感知注意力头中的模态信息并自适应保留关键令牌。

Result: 实验表明，MadaKV显著减少了KV缓存内存占用和模型推理解码延迟（提升1.3至1.5倍），同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: MadaKV在多模态长上下文任务中优于现有KV缓存淘汰方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

TL;DR: Fractional Reasoning是一种无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过动态调整推理强度提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Best-of-N、多数投票等）对输入统一处理，未考虑问题复杂度的差异。

Method: 提取潜在推理向量并调整其缩放因子，实现推理强度的连续控制。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500和GPQA等任务中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning能灵活适应不同复杂度问题，提升推理质量。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

Motivation: 语音音频信号高度可压缩，利用Transformer的自注意力机制可解释性，探索在神经编码阶段早期进行时间域信号稀疏化以加速转录。

Method: 在Whisper模型上进行架构搜索，研究稀疏化阶段（特定编码层）和压缩比（稀疏度）的联合空间。

Conclusion: 早期稀疏化可显著加速Transformer语音处理，且对准确率影响极小。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Result: 实验表明LAPT能提升对齐鲁棒性且不影响模型通用能力。

Conclusion: 当前对齐范式存在根本缺陷，需转向表征级训练策略而非仅监督表面行为。

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

Method: 通过设计2跳推理任务（离散潜在概念）和连续潜在概念任务，分析模型的表示空间和推理过程。

Result: 在离散概念任务中，模型成功识别并逐步组合概念；在连续概念任务中，表示空间呈现低维子空间，几何结构与潜在参数化一致。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对ICL和Transformer表示的理解，并提供了模型在ICL任务中解耦潜在概念的证据。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Motivation: 当前的研究主要关注简单的概念（如事实关联），忽视了注意力机制的影响，且缺乏分析复杂概念的统一方法。本文旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 提出SAMD方法，将复杂概念表示为向量，计算其与注意力头的余弦相似度，选择TopK得分头构建模块；进一步提出SAMI方法，通过标量参数调整模块效果。

Result: 实验证明模块位置在LLM训练前后稳定，SAMI在安全性和推理任务中表现显著提升，并在视觉任务中验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: SAMD和SAMI为Transformer模型的解释性和行为控制提供了有效工具，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Spotscape为空间转录组学提供了更有效的分析工具。

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

*Le Jiang,Liyan Ma,Guang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的防御框架，通过影子模型识别敏感区域并针对性注入噪声，平衡隐私保护与模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护分布式训练中具有潜力，但梯度反转攻击可能导致隐私泄露，现有防御方法缺乏针对性，影响模型准确性或保护不足。

Method: 利用影子模型和可解释性技术识别敏感区域，进行样本特定的噪声注入，以更精准地防御攻击。

Result: 在ChestXRay和EyePACS数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于无防御情况，且模型性能影响极小（F1降低小于1%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种医疗图像上验证了其泛化能力，显著提升防御效果（LPIPS和SSIM提升1.5%以上），并能抵御多种梯度反转攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的少样本类增量学习方法（Tri-WE），通过权重空间的三元集成和知识蒸馏正则化，解决了灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定特征提取器限制了模型对新类的适应性，导致灾难性遗忘和过拟合。

Method: 提出Tri-WE方法，在权重空间中插值基础模型、前一个模型和当前模型，并结合知识蒸馏正则化。

Result: 在miniImageNet、CUB200和CIFAR100数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Tri-WE方法有效解决了少样本类增量学习中的关键问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了自回归图像生成模型的令牌级水印，解决了重新标记导致的水印丢失问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

Motivation: 随着合并专家模型数量的增加，性能提升逐渐减少，任务向量空间出现秩崩溃现象，需要一种方法来维持合并效果。

Result: 在视觉基准测试中，Subspace Boosting将合并效果提升超过10%，适用于多达20个专家模型。

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting有效解决了模型合并中的秩崩溃问题，为模型合并提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了工业产品质量检测中机器学习替代人工的潜力，重点关注低质量数据下的模型鲁棒性问题，并提出改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工检测成本高且易错，机器学习虽有望替代，但现有方法在低质量数据或实际场景中表现不佳，缺乏实用指导。

Method: 评估两种先进模型，识别并改进生产数据质量问题，无需新数据；提出实用框架，帮助从业者识别模型或数据问题。

Result: 揭示了基于似然方法的常见缺陷，提出了更适合实际场景的经验风险估计框架。

Conclusion: 为工业实践中低质量数据下的异常检测提供了实用指导，改进了现有方法的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 自动生成文本的滥用风险需要有效的水印技术，但现有方法在同时用于检测和用户识别时会导致误检率上升。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出双水印技术，将检测水印和识别水印联合编码到生成文本中。

Result: 实验验证了理论分析，双水印显著降低了误检率，同时保持了高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 双水印是一种有效的解决方案，平衡了检测和用户识别的需求。

Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks
arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches
either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text
generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the
identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same
embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection
problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly
likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we
identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights,
we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification
watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BEAT的黑盒防御方法，用于检测并消除大型语言模型（LLM）中的后门攻击。该方法通过测量输入与探针拼接前后输出分布的变化来识别触发样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击能够隐秘地破坏LLM的安全对齐，且在正常安全审计中难以被发现，对LLMaaS等实际应用构成严重威胁。BEAT旨在解决这一安全问题。

Method: BEAT利用探针拼接效应，通过测量输入与探针拼接前后输出分布的扭曲程度来检测触发样本，从而识别后门攻击。

Result: 实验表明，BEAT在多种后门攻击和LLM（包括闭源的GPT-3.5-turbo）上均表现出高效性和有效性，并能防御常见的越狱攻击。

Conclusion: BEAT为黑盒环境下的LLM后门攻击提供了一种有效的防御方案，并展示了其在应对样本依赖性攻击和自然后门（如越狱攻击）中的潜力。

Abstract: Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the
stealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading
normal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the
applications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service
(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can
only interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the
attack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the
backdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden
trigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce
BEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to
deactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed
the probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples
significantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious
probe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT
identifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion
in the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the
input. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an
opposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal
signal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful
attack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple
sampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source
GPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.
Besides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against
popular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择和集成多种检索器的零样本加权组合方法，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常固定使用单一检索器，无法适应多样化的信息需求，因此需要一种动态选择和集成多种检索器的方法。

Method: 提出了一种零样本加权组合的混合检索器框架，结合了不同检索器的互补信号（如BM25的词汇匹配和密集检索器的语义相似性）。

Result: 实验表明，该混合检索器框架在仅0.8B参数的情况下，平均性能优于单一检索器和更大的7B模型，分别提升了10.8%和3.9%。此外，结合非专家人类信息源也能实现58.9%的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: 动态选择和集成多种检索器是一种高效且有效的方法，能够显著提升检索增强生成的性能，并适用于多样化的信息需求。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness
hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct,
often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers,
semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based
on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can
we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual
query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this
intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a
zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive
experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite
totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual
retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average,
respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help
incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to
achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over
simulated humans alone.

Motivation: 在专业领域中，标注查询-文档对的成本高昂，因此需要自监督学习方法训练密集检索器。

Method: Revela通过结合局部和跨文档上下文，利用检索器计算的相似性分数加权注意力机制，优化检索器作为语言建模的一部分。

Result: 在BEIR和CoIR基准测试中，Revela在NDCG@10上分别提升了5.2%和5.6%，性能随模型规模增加而提升。

Conclusion: Revela展示了自监督检索器学习的有效性和可扩展性，为专业领域检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized
knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically
requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in
specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised
retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies
through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we
can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.
This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised
learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training
framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela
models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token
prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch
attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed
similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language
modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific
(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter
scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements
of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,
respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model
size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for
self-supervised retriever learning.

Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans,
is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history.
Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP
are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory
equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for
point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable
RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for
acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within
one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is
approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of
RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.
infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.
sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.
infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop
laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis
capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the
third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms
observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system
decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on
specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease
detection and control in the field.

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进小波基函数和核函数的结合方式，显著提升了无定向点云重建的效果和效率。

Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics
and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and
orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good
and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points.
Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these
methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings,
we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function
and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the
modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface,
aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the
calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the
convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet
basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing
the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional
homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix
construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to
further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our
source codes will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements
suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient
debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options
depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV.
In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon
avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS
technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV
compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices'
native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit
generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased
using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits
were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.

Motivation: 现代多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理长视频时，KV缓存会线性增长，超出边缘设备的固定内存限制。现有压缩方法无法满足流式视频的实时性和内存限制需求。

Method: InfiniPot-V通过动态监控缓存，使用时间轴冗余（TaR）指标去除冗余令牌，并通过值范数（VaN）排名保留语义重要令牌，实现硬性内存上限。

Result: 在四个开源MLLMs和多个长视频/流式视频基准测试中，InfiniPot-V将GPU峰值内存降低高达94%，保持实时生成，且精度不降。

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V无需重新训练或查询知识，解决了KV缓存瓶颈，为边缘设备上的流式视频助手提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，类别不平衡和难度不平衡会影响神经网络性能，现有方法计算成本高且效果有限。

Method: 提出Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss（PM Dice loss），通过像素级调制项结合Dice损失的优势，同时处理两种不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个常用医学分割任务中，PM Dice loss表现优于其他针对难度不平衡的方法。

Conclusion: PM Dice loss是一种简单高效的方法，能同时解决类别和难度不平衡问题，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Motivation: 膝关节骨关节炎（KOA）自动分级存在观察者间差异大和深度学习模型在关键决策边界附近鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的潜在空间，通过随机微分方程（SDE）生成反事实样本，并结合自校正学习策略优化分类器。

Conclusion: DCA框架将模型不确定性转化为鲁棒训练信号，为开发更准确和可信的自动诊断系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged
by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep
learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based
Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and
interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method
navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential
Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with
a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a
self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its
specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)
datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification
accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides
interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that
the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA
progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a
robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more
accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at

Conclusion: MoNetV2通过多模态融合和一致性约束，有效解决了自由手3D超声重建的挑战。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.
Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing
methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across
three large datasets.

Motivation: IHC染色成本高、耗时长且资源密集，而H&E染色是病理分析的基础。研究旨在通过计算模型预测IHC染色模式，提高诊断效率。

Method: 提出HistoStainAlign框架，通过对比训练策略整合H&E和IHC的联合表征，无需补丁级注释或组织配准。

Result: 在胃肠道和肺组织WSIs上评估，对P53、PD-L1和Ki-67三种IHC染色的加权F1分数分别为0.735、0.830和0.723。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为IHC染色的预筛选工具，提高工作流程效率，减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

Motivation: 现有无需训练的感知图像编解码器依赖扩散反转或样本通信，解码时间过长（1分钟至不可行），需改进。

Method: 提出理论保证的算法，针对不同解码时间预算（≈0.1s、0.1-10s、≥10s）优化感知质量。

Result: 解码时间从1分钟降至0.1-10秒，感知质量相当；适用于非可微分编解码器（如VTM），并可改进现有感知编解码器（如MS-ILLM）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升感知质量并减少解码时间，优于现有基于条件生成模型的编解码器（如HiFiC和MS-ILLM）。

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional
generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative
model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample
communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a
single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves
the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We
further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when
decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach:
1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s
with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable
codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such
as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off.
Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual
quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves
comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding
time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model
based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is

Motivation: 远程皮肤病学中图像质量差是主要问题，但现有研究未充分利用非皮肤病学IQA的最新进展。

Method: 创建新的皮肤病学IQA数据库，结合跨领域训练方法，利用更大规模的图像数据。

Result: 跨领域训练在多个领域表现最优，克服了皮肤病学IQA数据规模小的限制。

Conclusion: 跨领域训练能有效提升远程皮肤病学中的图像质量管理。

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

Motivation: 在加速采集或患者运动条件下，切片到体积重建对恢复解剖一致的3D脑体积至关重要，但现有方法面临局部和全局结构破坏的挑战。

Method: PR-INR结合运动感知扩散模块生成粗略重建，隐式细节恢复模块进行残差细化，体素连续感知表示模块实现高精度细节恢复。

Conclusion: PR-INR框架有效解决了MRI重建中的多层次结构问题，具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume
reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain
volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient
motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural
disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global
structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we
propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)
framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and
volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a
motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric
reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical
structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that
performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual
features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.
Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as
a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice
completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five
public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement),
undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental
results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows
generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Result: 在两个真实临床胸部X光数据集上，反事实图像显著提升了分割准确性。

Conclusion: 反事实图像有助于改善解剖结构分割，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法为胎龄计算提供了一种高效、可靠的自动化解决方案，尤其适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased
neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate
estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but
traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are
in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer
greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce
variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method
for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation
architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity
of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly
suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is
particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

Conclusion: VesselSDF为临床环境中的血管分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains
a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin,
branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes.
Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often
struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this
challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed
distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method
reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where
each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest
vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth,
tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain
accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as
floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures
smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry
near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that
VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel
geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical
settings.

Result: DiffO在压缩性能和解码速度上均优于现有方法，解码速度提升约50倍。

Conclusion: DiffO显著提升了生成编解码器的实用性，适用于极低比特率场景。

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has
inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer
severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent
diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low
bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding
latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first
single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high
perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves
these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which
factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space,
capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate
adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match
the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of
the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x
compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality
of generative codecs. The code will be available at

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning
models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting

leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to
histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model
architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show
that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on
histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized
architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis,
particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal
Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific
architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing
overfitting.

Motivation: 18F-FDG PET在特定肿瘤中效果有限，而18F-DOPA具有更高特异性，但其合成复杂且临床应用受限。直接在投影域建模可减少图像重建过程中的误差累积。

Method: 研究采用先验引导的联合扩散模型（PJDM），包括粗估计模型和先验细化模型。通过高阶混合采样器生成初始合成图像，并利用学习到的先验进行迭代细化。

Result: 实验结果表明，PJDM显著提高了投影域图像的质量和合成效果。

Conclusion: PJDM为18F-FDG到18F-DOPA PET图像的转换提供了一种有效方法，减少了误差累积并提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic
activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers.
18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but
shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast,
6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity
for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex
synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread
adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data
acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more
direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the
accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process.
Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion
model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in
projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior
refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial
synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid
sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition
to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental
results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and
synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due
to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the
joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study
introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature
correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and
an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the
ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel
dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between
the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram
matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically
fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses
emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the
industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network
realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial
background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多潜在空间引导的纹理条件扩散变换模型（MS-CDT），用于PET成像中的示踪剂分离，首次结合纹理条件和多潜在空间技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多示踪剂PET成像能提供更全面的生理和病理信息，但由于不同示踪剂的光子对能量相同，信号难以区分。

Method: 整合扩散和变换器架构，引入纹理掩码作为条件输入，利用多潜在空间先验捕获多层次特征。

Result: 在脑部和胸部3D PET数据集上，MS-CDT在图像质量和临床信息保留方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MS-CDT通过纹理条件和多潜在空间技术，实现了更准确和鲁棒的示踪剂分离。

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET)
is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide
supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological
function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of
physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by
positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the
same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this
study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer
model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent
space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates
diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,
with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image
details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,
the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance
computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as
conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,
thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image
textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this
conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer
separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with
several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest
scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive
performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant
information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在医学影像诊断中应用广泛，但易受对抗攻击和分布偏移影响，降低了诊断的可靠性和信任度。

Method: 采用数据增强的鲁棒训练算法（RTDA），并与六种基线技术（包括对抗训练和数据增强）进行对比。

Result: RTDA在对抗攻击和分布偏移下表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: RTDA是一种有效的解决方案，可提升医学图像分类模型的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Conclusion: MeDi为利用生成模型减少数据偏差提供了概念验证，有望推动临床应用的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

Motivation: 解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，探索GAN生成数据在增强有限数据集中的潜力。

Method: 使用DCGAN生成合成图像，与真实图像按不同比例混合训练CNN，并在真实测试集上评估性能。

Result: 少量GAN数据（如100张）显著提升模型性能（测试准确率95.2%），但过多GAN数据会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: GAN生成数据可有效扩充有限医学影像数据集，但需控制比例以避免引入影响泛化能力的伪影。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

Motivation: 当前结构着色模型依赖大量预处理数据，缺乏对隐式神经表示的全面研究。

Method: 采用MLP从数据压缩角度出发，设计了一种针对衍射反射数据集特性的训练和建模方法，避免过拟合并具有鲁棒的重采样行为。

Result: 通过PSNR、SSIM和FLIP评估，高质量重建了真实数据，内存占用降低两个数量级，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持主观相似结果的同时，实现了高效的数据驱动渲染，为衍射表面建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and
photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures.
Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately
capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy
data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been
addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of
diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach
this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training
and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of
diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting
and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator
(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of
the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,
wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively
similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory
footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we
depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高斯曲率惩罚，需要完整的Hessian计算和二阶自动微分，计算成本高。

Method: 提出两种曲率代理方法：(i) 有限差分代理，用四个前向SDF评估和一个一阶梯度替代Hessian；(ii) 自动微分代理，通过Hessian-向量积计算混合导数。

Result: 在ABC基准测试中，代理方法的重建精度与Hessian基线相当或更好，同时减少GPU内存使用和运行时间50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为工程级形状重建提供了一种高效、可扩展的曲率感知SDF学习路径。

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of
a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing
localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and
the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging
topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a
topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The
proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of
global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found
location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan
matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization.
We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and
compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place
recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep
learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for
safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an
uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for
autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our
approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor
error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to
2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation
conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly
capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic
vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset,
which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both
the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with
Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show
that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor
weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian
Mixture model.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can
significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing
methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled
imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in
complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and
illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and
localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative
patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative
distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global
feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation
module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal
patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior
performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on
MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on
other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its
capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems
across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that
HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust
and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous
industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required.
Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low
computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during
inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of
generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In
response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative
models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal
information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,
which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene
comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate
state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear
computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to
learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the
learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of
the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a
remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it
outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally,
FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of
real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference
speed.

such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully
completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At
present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth
sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,
which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),
and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art
monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths
up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful
zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a
novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover
metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on
MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera
calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate
depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the
testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on
tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA
achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains
challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to
address this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising
paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and
high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset
contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and
articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates
geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions
to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly
introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and
robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at
