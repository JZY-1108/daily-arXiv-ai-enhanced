### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖框架，通过修改外交事件叙述来将公众情绪从负面转为中性或正面。该框架结合语言模型预测和反事实生成算法，在保持核心事实不变的情况下改变叙事框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统情绪分析方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性。需要一种能够主动引导公众情绪的数据驱动方法。

Method: 1) 训练语言模型预测外交事件的公众反应；2) 与领域专家合作确定可修改的文本特征；3) 开发反事实生成算法系统性地产生文本修改版本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来塑造更理想的公众情绪。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于说话人风格感知的音素锚定框架，用于解决跨语言语音情感识别中的语音变异性问题，通过图聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区，并在说话人和音素空间进行双空间锚定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间语音变异性差异和说话人特定表达风格的挑战，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外化的框架。

Method: 使用图聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区来捕捉共享的说话人特征，然后在说话人和音素空间应用双空间锚定技术，实现更好的跨语言情感迁移。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，该方法相比竞争基线具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语言情感表征的共性提供了有价值的见解，有效提升了跨语言语音情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

*Nithin Somasekharan,Ling Yue,Yadi Cao,Weichao Li,Patrick Emami,Pochinapeddi Sai Bhargav,Anurag Acharya,Xingyu Xie,Shaowu Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFDLLMBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在计算流体动力学领域能力的基准测试套件，包含三个组件来测试LLM的CFD知识、数值物理推理和工作流实现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在自动化复杂物理系统数值实验方面的应用尚未充分探索。计算流体动力学作为计算科学的重要工具，为评估LLM的科学能力提供了独特挑战。

Method: 开发了包含CFDQuery、CFDCodeBench和FoamBench三个组件的基准测试套件，基于真实CFD实践，结合详细任务分类和严格评估框架，评估代码可执行性、解精度和数值收敛行为。

Result: CFDLLMBench为LLM驱动的复杂物理系统数值实验自动化建立了坚实的开发和评估基础。

Conclusion: 该基准测试套件能够全面评估LLM在CFD领域的性能，促进LLM在科学计算自动化中的应用发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种机器学习方法检测ChatGPT-3.5生成的学术摘要的能力，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等大语言模型的广泛应用，区分AI生成文本与人类写作变得至关重要，这关系到学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等问题。

Method: 使用250对研究摘要数据集，比较了传统方法（逻辑回归+BOW/POS/TF-IDF）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT+N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT+自定义分类器、LSTM+N-gram），并测试了集成学习效果。

Result: DistilBERT获得最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供平衡的替代方案，LSTM和BERT-N-gram表现较差。三种最佳模型的集成投票未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示优于模型多样性，为未来开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来应对不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

### [5] [ConceptViz: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Concepts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20376)
*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，用于探索大型语言模型中的概念表示，通过识别-解释-验证流程帮助研究人员理解SAE特征与人类概念之间的对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器(SAEs)在提取LLM可解释特征方面表现出色，但这些特征并不天然与人类可理解的概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，允许用户使用感兴趣的概念查询SAEs，交互式探索概念-特征对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明ConceptViz的有效性，结果显示该系统通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员构建更准确的LLM特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at
https://github.com/Happy-Hippo209/ConceptViz.

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回无关内容，导致模型产生幻觉。需要理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容（自我知识），以更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，设计基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上利用模型的自我知识来过滤无关检索内容

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中使用Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B进行评估，实验结果表明SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，SKILL-RAG能有效提升RAG系统的性能

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的TTS系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征对齐到词级获得情感标注，通过FiLM层调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM在表达性语音合成中展现出有效性和通用性

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了USB-Rec框架，通过整合训练和推理阶段来提升大语言模型在对话推荐系统中的性能，包括基于偏好的强化学习训练策略和自增强推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的对话推荐系统主要关注如何利用LLMs的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题，导致模型在对话推荐任务上的性能受限。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过整合训练和推理过程，有效提升了LLMs在对话推荐任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20461)
*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Conformal Importance Summarization框架，通过共形预测为摘要生成提供严格的内容覆盖保证，确保关键信息在摘要中被保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自动摘要系统在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域缺乏对关键内容包含的可靠保证，需要一种能够提供严格覆盖保证的摘要方法。

Method: 使用共形预测方法，通过在句子级别重要性分数上校准阈值，实现具有用户指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要。该方法模型无关，仅需小型校准集，可与现有黑盒LLMs无缝集成。

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization达到了理论保证的信息覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠、可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TikTok等短视频平台的内容具有多模态、动态和嘈杂的特点，给错误信息检测带来独特挑战，需要专门工具来辅助人工核查。

Method: 采用模块化、仅推理的流水线，集成语音转录、OCR、物体和深度伪造检测、视频到文本摘要以及声明验证等技术。

Result: 在两个多语言TikTok视频手动标注数据集上的验证显示，该系统取得了有希望的结果，加权F1分数超过70%。

Conclusion: ShortCheck提供了一个用户友好的界面，能够有效识别值得核查的短视频，为事实核查工作提供有力支持。

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object
and deepfake detection, video-to-text summarization, and claim verification.
ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets
with TikTok videos in a multilingual setting. The pipeline achieves promising
results with F1-weighted score over 70\%.

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一种基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将令牌使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大的问题，需要频繁的智能体间通信，导致令牌消耗和推理时间显著增加。

Method: MARS采用审稿流程设计：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿人整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订，避免了审稿人之间的交互成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但令牌使用量和推理时间均减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS框架在保持推理质量的同时有效控制了计算成本，为大语言模型的多智能体协作提供了一种高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SiniticMTError是一个新的数据集，为英语到普通话、粤语和吴语的机器翻译提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，旨在支持低资源语言的机器翻译研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得重大进展，但许多低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）由于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源，进展仍然有限。

Method: 基于现有平行语料库构建数据集，由母语者进行严格标注过程，包括错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，并分析标注者间一致性和错误模式。

Result: 创建了SiniticMTError数据集，为机器翻译社区提供了支持错误检测能力模型微调的资源。

Conclusion: 该数据集支持翻译质量评估、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估研究，有助于推动低资源语言机器翻译的发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一的多语言医疗诊断框架，能够在英语、印地语和孟加拉语之间进行零样本跨语言疾病诊断，无需语言特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医疗环境中临床文本自动疾病诊断的挑战，特别是低资源语言标注数据稀缺和跨语言变异性问题。

Method: 基于XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、孪生对比学习模块、翻译一致性模块和对比投影头，采用多任务学习和元学习策略。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%准确率和97.17% F1分数；零样本场景下在印地语和孟加拉语上分别达到92.78%和73.33%的准确率。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力，特别适用于低资源语言环境。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态推理链架构，通过深度专业化专家混合模型实现自适应计算深度，相比传统Transformer可节省16%计算量、提升35%推理速度，并在复杂推理任务上获得2.8%准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入使用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询浪费资源而复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度动态调整计算深度的架构。

Method: 提出深度专业化专家混合模型(DS-MoE)，包含不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等），通过学习路由网络动态组装定制化推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示：计算节省16%，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理准确率提升2.8%，同时路由决策提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE证明了深度专业化模块化处理能同时提升大语言模型的效率、推理质量和可解释性，是自适应神经架构的重要进展。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT是一种受小波启发的分层Transformer架构，通过多分辨率处理语言，解决了标准Transformer在处理语言层次结构时的缺陷，实现了更高的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer将文本处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次结构，导致计算成本高、组合泛化能力弱和语篇建模不足。

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer（HRT），构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的上下文化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减实现O(nlogn)复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中，HRT平均性能提升3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发的处理方式在理论效率和实践性能上的双重优势。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练，实现8步采样即可达到1024步基线的性能，采样速度提升128倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要数百到数千次迭代，两者都存在效率问题。

Method: 采用离散流匹配技术，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，8步采样即可达到1024步离散流基线的困惑度水平，采样速度提升128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了采样效率，为高效语言生成提供了新方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种文本性能预测方法，通过任务描述和配置来预测模型性能，无需实际实验。研究者构建了PRECOG数据集，实验表明该方法具有挑战性但可行，能实现中等预测性能并支持智能实验优先级排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型评估瓶颈：传统方法需要构建基准、评估模型、迭代实验，过程耗时。研究能否在运行实验前预测结果，实现前瞻性评估。

Method: 开发文本性能预测方法：基于任务描述和配置估计模型得分，无需访问数据集实例。构建PRECOG语料库，包含多样化任务、领域和指标。采用检索模块排除源论文信息。

Result: 任务具有挑战性但可行：模型达到中等预测性能，在Accuracy子集上平均绝对误差低至8.7。强推理模型能进行多样化迭代查询，而开源模型表现滞后。在零泄漏设置下，GPT-5仍能获得显著预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式前瞻性评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和智能实验优先级排序，有助于更高效地推进语言模型发展。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然日语资源丰富，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据稀缺，需要解决数据稀疏性问题来构建更精确的日语语音识别器。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）多任务训练方案，引入辅助损失函数估计正交文本标签和输入信号的音高模式；2）融合基于音素字母串和文本标记序列的两个估计器，使用有限状态转换器框架开发组合算法。

Result: 多任务学习和融合方法有效提高了音素识别器的准确性，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。在CSJ核心评估集上，平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降至7.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的多任务学习和融合方法能有效解决数据稀疏性问题，显著提升日语语音识别器在音素级别（特别是包含重音标记）的识别性能。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测(MPP)。该方法通过提示LLM生成领域相关知识和可执行代码来创建知识特征，并与结构表示融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN和自监督学习在MPP方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLM存在知识差距和幻觉问题，特别是在研究较少的分子性质方面，因此需要结合结构特征来提升预测性能。

Method: 使用GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLM进行知识提取，生成领域知识和分子向量化代码，然后将知识特征与结构表示融合。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与分子结构特征的集成能够显著提升分子性质预测的性能，为解决LLM的知识局限性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别被修改的文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分探索。作者希望研究攻击者如何针对检测模型进行攻击。

Method: 提出了RedHerring攻击方法，通过修改文本来使检测模型误报攻击，同时确保分类器仍能正确分类。在4个数据集上测试了3种检测器防御4种分类器的效果。

Result: RedHerring能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出了简单的置信度检查作为初步防御方法。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型为理解攻击者如何针对检测模型提供了新的视角，揭示了检测模型可能存在的脆弱性。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低了对抗文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的NLP模型复杂度增加，对抗文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升。现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于多长文本来结合两种方法。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均可将每次攻击所需的查询次数减少25.82%，且不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新策略有效解决了对抗文本攻击中的计算效率问题，为资源受限的研究者提供了实用的攻击测试方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中的语音情感识别在领域不匹配时表现不佳，源数据不可用且大型音频语言模型只能通过API访问，需要开发无需源数据的适应方法

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架，使用大型音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为双教师，通过互信息加权的平均分布和指数移动平均教师来稳定训练

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移实验中，学生模型超越了大型音频语言模型，比最强基线高出3.9%

Conclusion: 该方法无需共享源数据就能增强情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在处理复杂问题时缺乏可靠的置信度评估机制，需要一种能够无缝集成到现有模型中并提升推理可靠性的方法。

Method: C2R首先构建子问题及其答案的集合来探索不同的推理路径，然后比较答案候选者的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。该方法仅依赖模型自身的置信度评分，无需额外训练。

Result: C2R在多种模型和基准测试中表现出一致的性能提升，能够无缝集成到现有QA模型中。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题的数量和质量对模型推理稳健性的影响，为可靠推理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但缺乏系统性的实证和理论分析。本文旨在重新评估这一权衡关系，并提供有效的缓解策略。

Method: 通过实证研究学习率的影响，提出理论分析框架，并开发TALR方法。同时比较了L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等多种策略。

Result: 实验表明小学习率能显著改善权衡关系，TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面优于其他基线方法，但没有方法能完全消除权衡。

Conclusion: 提出实用指南：使用小学习率获得有利权衡；当需要更强平衡时，采用TALR作为有效策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了原子理论（Atoms Theory），将大语言模型内部表示的基本单元定义为原子，解决了神经元多义性和特征重建不稳定的问题。通过原子内积校正表示偏移，证明了原子满足受限等距性质，确保稀疏表示的稳定性。实验验证了原子能更准确地捕捉LLMs的内在表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的内部表示基本单元（神经元或特征）存在定义不清的问题：神经元具有多义性，而特征重建不可靠且不稳定。这限制了对模型机制的理解，需要找到更可靠的基本表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本表示单元；引入原子内积（AIP）校正表示偏移；证明原子满足受限等距性质（RIP）；使用带阈值激活的单层稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别原子；在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示：SAEs在平均各层实现99.9%的稀疏重建；超过99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件（神经元仅0.5%，特征68.2%）；原子能更准确地捕捉LLMs的内在表示；缩放实验揭示了SAEs大小与恢复能力的关系。

Conclusion: 原子理论为大语言模型的内部表示提供了系统的理论框架，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。原子比神经元和特征更能忠实反映LLMs的内在表示结构。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

TL;DR: 本文提出对话式提示方法，通过将用户评论重新表述为多轮对话来解决少样本和免训练情况下的个性化评论生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和免训练场景，传统方法假设用户有大量历史评论或需要额外模型训练，而LLMs的有效性依赖提示工程。

Method: 提出对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并让模型修正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使每个用户只有2条评论。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和免训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案，CCP在高质量负样本可用时表现更好，SCP在无法收集此类数据时仍具竞争力。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and

TL;DR: 本文提出Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，弥合结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟，在KGQA任务中实现高效证据提取和精确推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中表现出强大推理能力，但在知识密集型场景如知识图谱问答中仍存在幻觉和事实错误问题，主要原因是结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，通过三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐度，实现高效证据提取和精确推理。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量知识图谱并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架能有效弥合知识图谱与查询之间的语义鸿沟，在保证低计算成本、可扩展性和适应性的同时，提升KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO是一种新颖的语法错误校正方法，通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的过度校正倾向来提升小型语言模型（sLMs）的召回率，同时通过后校正步骤保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在语法错误校正中召回率低的问题，同时避免大型语言模型过度校正导致的精度下降，实现召回率和精度的平衡。

Method: PoCO方法分为两步：首先使用LLM进行过度校正以最大化召回率，然后通过微调的小型模型进行后校正来识别和修正错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO能有效平衡语法错误校正性能，在保持竞争力的精度同时显著提升召回率，从而提高整体校正质量。

Conclusion: PoCO成功结合了LLMs的生成能力和sLMs的可靠性，为语法错误校正提供了一种有效的平衡策略。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型多示例上下文学习计算成本高的问题，减少输入token数量

Method: 将多示例ICL的信息蒸馏为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文

Result: 在复杂推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL用更少token达到与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLM进行下游任务的实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于树搜索的零样本迭代句子重写算法，用于保护大语言模型使用中的隐私信息，在保持文本自然性和实用性的同时有效隐藏敏感信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型，动态探索重写空间，逐步重写隐私敏感片段

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在隐私保护和效用保持之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保护敏感信息的同时维持文本的质量和可用性

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在检索增强生成(RAG)问答系统中生成子句级别引用的方法，以解决现有句子或段落级别引用存在的问题，使引用更加简洁和充分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的引用通常只在句子或段落级别，存在两个问题：长句子/段落包含大量无关内容；句子级别引用可能遗漏验证输出所需的关键信息，迫使用户阅读上下文。

Method: 开发了子句级别引用的标注指南并构建相应数据集；提出了一个引用生成框架，利用LLM自动生成微调数据，并使用信用模型过滤低质量样本。

Result: 在构建的数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成高质量且更易读的引用。

Conclusion: 子句级别的引用方法能够有效减少用户验证生成输出正确性所需的工作量，提高了引用的可读性和实用性。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但应用监督微调时面临挑战，因为缺乏每个去噪步骤的精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致

Method: 提出WeFT方法，根据令牌的熵为令牌分配不同权重进行加权监督微调，该方法基于扩散理论设计

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准上分别比标准SFT相对提升39%、64%和83%

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型的监督微调问题，显著提升了推理任务的性能

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型在开放性问题中仍只生成单一答案，这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 研究提示和微调两种方法：监督微调模仿标注响应，强化微调通过奖励函数激励探索；提出针对排名列表的新奖励函数。

Result: 监督微调模型在某些答案格式上表现良好，但强化微调模型在多种格式上更稳健；模型能识别有效答案即使未选择基准首选答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理超长文档摘要时普遍存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来解决这些局限性。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含摘要生成器、摘要评审器、问题生成器和问题评审器，通过问答机制作为质量检查，利用审查者智能体验证摘要是否包含回答问题所需信息，实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore指标以及LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的长文档摘要方法，利用对抗性智能体协作来提高摘要质量，多智能体协作动态和问答机制的有效性得到验证。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出MemLens方法，通过分析数字令牌在生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测LLM的记忆化现象，发现受污染样本在模型早期层就锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中逐渐积累证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法主要依赖表面词汇重叠和困惑度，泛化能力低，在遇到隐式污染数据时性能显著下降。需要更有效的方法来检测LLM在数学基准测试中的记忆化问题。

Method: 提出MemLens方法，分析数字令牌生成时的概率轨迹。通过LoRA微调注入精心设计的样本来验证轨迹模式。

Result: 受污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹。受污染样本在早期层就表现出高置信度的"捷径"行为，而干净样本则呈现渐进式证据积累。

Conclusion: MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关性，为LLM记忆化检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于局部性理论和跨语言依赖长度最小化证据，研究旨在改进线性距离测量，通过结构化的干预者复杂度来更精确地解释句子理解中的记忆负荷。

Method: 使用统一依赖树库和混合效应框架，在多语言环境中联合评估句子长度、依赖长度和干预者复杂度作为记忆负荷预测因子的效果，将记忆负荷操作化为特征错误绑定和特征干扰的线性总和。

Result: 所有三个因素都与记忆负荷正相关，句子长度影响最广泛，干预者复杂度在线性距离之外提供了额外的解释力，表明结构因素对处理效率有独立贡献。

Conclusion: 研究在概念上调和了线性和层次视角，方法上展示了基于UD的图测量和跨语言混合效应模型如何区分线性和结构因素对处理效率的贡献，为评估记忆负荷理论提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对阿拉伯语等其他语言的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发多语言工具增强代理。

Method: 通过将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语，使用基础版和后训练版的阿拉伯语LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 研究结果为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解和优化策略。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了阿拉伯语工具调用研究的空白，为多语言LLM工具调用能力的发展提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Motivation: 研究LLM在自动评估学术文本输入问题方面的应用潜力，探索如何利用评分标准进行公平有效的自动评分。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估，在包含110个计算机科学答案的数据集上测试了三种模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文证明因果掩码本身就能提供位置信息，即使没有参数或因果依赖。因果掩码与RoPE的交互会扭曲相对注意力模式，表明需要将因果掩码视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RoPE等显式位置编码是Transformer解码器中位置信息的主要来源，但因果掩码也提供位置信息。本文旨在探究因果掩码本身如何影响注意力模式。

Method: 通过理论分析证明因果掩码能诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并通过实证分析验证训练模型中的这种行为。特别研究了因果掩码与RoPE的交互作用。

Result: 因果掩码倾向于偏向附近的查询-键对，与常见位置编码行为相似。因果掩码与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力得分模式为非相对模式。在现代大语言模型中一致观察到这种效应。

Conclusion: 需要将因果掩码视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源，因果掩码与位置编码的交互效应值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SoM-1K基准数据集，用于评估基础模型在材料强度工程问题上的表现，并提出了一种名为DoI的新型提示策略来改善模型对复杂视觉信息的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未得到充分探索，特别是在材料强度领域缺乏专门的评估基准。

Method: 创建包含1,065个标注问题的SoM-1K数据集，提出DoI（图像描述）提示策略，将视觉图表转换为专家生成的文本描述，并评估8个代表性基础模型。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅为56.6%。有趣的是，配备DoI的LLM通常优于直接处理视觉图表的VLM。

Conclusion: DoI策略能有效减少视觉误解错误，表明准确的文本描述在当前比直接图像输入更有效。这项工作为工程AI建立了严格基准，凸显了开发更强大多模态推理能力的必要性。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

TL;DR: 本文发现大型语言模型存在文化定位偏见，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对非主流文化采用外部视角。作者提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，证明基于智能体的方法能有效减轻偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在广泛的下游生成应用中存在风险，可能延续与文化相关的微妙公平性问题，将生成内容定位为主流美国文化视角，而对非主流文化表现出明显的外部性。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境化访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。提出两种推理时缓解方法：基于提示的公平干预支柱（FIP）和基于智能体的公平缓解框架（MFA），包括单智能体（MFA-SA）和多智能体（MFA-MA）两种管道。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的实证评估显示明显模式：模型在美国情境脚本中平均88%以上采用内部视角，而对较少主导文化主要采用外部视角。基于智能体的方法在缓解偏见方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 文化定位偏见是LLMs中一个重要的公平性问题，基于智能体的缓解方法为减轻生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外在和内在幻觉，评估显示LLMs在检测波斯语幻觉方面普遍表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言（如波斯语）中的幻觉问题，波斯语缺乏专门的幻觉评估基准。

Method: 使用三阶段LLM驱动流程生成可信答案和摘要，结合人工验证，利用生成令牌的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人工标注者标注波斯语特定文化内容。

Result: 评估12个LLMs（开源和闭源）发现模型在检测波斯语幻觉方面普遍困难，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可部分缓解幻觉，波斯语专门训练的LLMs与其他模型在幻觉方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语LLMs存在严重幻觉问题，需要专门评估基准和改进方法，外部知识有助于缓解但未完全解决问题。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强大语言模型个性化能力的基准测试，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，结合细粒度偏好评分和反馈进行诊断性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然通过检索集成减轻了用户的认知负担，但无法充分满足不同用户的多样化需求，缺乏对个性化能力的系统性评估。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注构建基准，收集真实用户的历史数据，让标注者提供查询需求和评估响应，结合偏好评分和诊断反馈。

Result: BESPOKE基准能够系统分析信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLMs提供细粒度评估基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE填补了搜索增强LLMs个性化评估的空白，为开发更有效的个性化信息检索系统提供了重要工具和数据集。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个基于语音的偏见基准测试数据集，扩展了文本BBQ数据集，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型中的社会偏见可能来自内容方面和声学方面，需要专门的评估工具来诊断这两种偏见来源。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的每个上下文转换为受控的语音条件，使评估结果可与原始文本基准相比较，计算每个维度的准确率、偏见和一致性分数。

Result: 评估了两个语音语言模型：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著抑制这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，可联合诊断语音语言模型中的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的数据集来系统分析语音语言模型中的声学性别差异现象，发现LLaMA-Omni系列模型存在矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向响应，而在性别相关问题上却忽视性别信息。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型可能基于说话者性别对相同问题给出不同回应，存在声学性别差异问题。需要系统分析这一现象以促进语音技术的公平性。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别独立、性别刻板印象和性别相关三类。评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析中性选项、语音感知性别和性别中性化方法的影响，并与对应骨干LLM进行比较。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题上所有模型都表现出男性导向响应，而在性别相关问题上却忽视性别信息。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，虽然优先考虑一般公平原则但忽视了上下文适当性，需要更复杂的技术来正确利用语音中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ROC的新框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，解决了传统分类方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：忽视实体类型和位置线索等结构约束，以及缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索范式有效解决了多模态关系抽取中的结构约束和语义表达问题，为关系理解提供了更强大的方法。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM如何处理任务指令中的语法、领域和语义信息，特别是识别语法与领域之间的虚假相关性对模型行为的影响。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析语法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型的影响，并开发评估框架检测这种现象在FlanV2数据集和不同模型（OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick、GPT-4o）中的存在。

Result: 语法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06），并在开放和闭源模型中普遍存在，可能被用于绕过安全拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要明确测试语法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中特别是领域内的语法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特征，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖情境的构造，需要大量推理能力，因此适合评估现代大语言模型的常识知识和推理能力。

Method: 采用文献综述的方法，系统梳理计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务，分析当前模型的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型在幽默处理能力上仍远不及人类水平。

Conclusion: 论文强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并基于幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性特点，提出了该领域未来研究的广泛方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Motivation: 小型语言模型在特定领域表现接近大型语言模型且能耗更低，但其在下游任务中的PII泄露风险尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT模型，然后提出基于贪婪坐标梯度的GEP方法专门用于PII提取，并在自由风格插入的复杂场景下进行测试。

Result: GEP方法相比之前的模板方法泄露检测效果提升60倍，在自由风格插入场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: SLM存在显著的PII泄露风险，需要开发专门的检测方法，GEP方法在复杂现实场景下仍能有效揭示信息泄露问题。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索导致推理碎片化（工具税），以及多代理管道稀释强解决方案。

Method: 基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）进行结构化协作。

Result: 在HLE Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率（当前最高），比最强代理基线提升13.4点，比前沿LLM提升18.1点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的代理步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示推理失败和知识缺口在85%以上案例中同时出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

Conclusion: 实现可信的法律推理需要准确知识检索（可通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大通用推理能力的协同作用。该工作为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem是一种基于句子图的内存管理方法，用于解决长对话中超出LLM上下文窗口的问题，通过多粒度图结构组织对话信息，在长对话问答任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法在组织和检索不同粒度的对话信息方面存在困难，需要更有效的长期对话记忆管理方案。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉回合、轮次和会话级别的关联，结合原始对话和生成记忆（摘要、事实、见解）为LLM提供连贯上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高准确性，在长对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长期对话记忆，为LLM提供更好的上下文支持，是长对话代理的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

TL;DR: QCG-RAG是一个查询中心的图RAG框架，通过可控粒度的查询中心图解决现有图RAG方法的粒度困境，在多跳推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图token成本高且丢失上下文，粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 使用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建可控粒度的查询中心图，设计专门的多跳检索机制通过生成查询选择相关chunk。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确率上持续优于现有的chunk-based和graph-based RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量同音异义词重复率的方法，评估了不同扩散模型在同音异义词处理上的表现，并通过提示扩展技术缓解同音异义词重复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）给生成模型带来挑战，扩散模型在处理同音异义词时可能同时生成多个词义，导致同音异义词重复问题。这个问题因Anglocentric偏见（需要额外翻译步骤）而更加复杂。

Method: 引入测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型进行自动评估和人工评估，研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型的性能，发现提示扩展方法能有效减少同音异义词重复，包括由Anglocentric偏见引起的重复问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效测量和缓解同音异义词重复问题，提示扩展技术对减少Anglocentric偏见相关的重复也有效果，自动评估代码已公开。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务依赖的方法来评估和缓解大语言模型的输出同质化问题，通过任务分类、功能多样性评估和任务锚定采样技术来解决不同任务类型对多样性的不同需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估输出同质化时往往忽视了任务依赖性，而实际上不同任务对输出多样性的要求不同（如数学任务要求答案一致但解法多样，创意写作任务要求关键叙事元素多样）。

Method: 提出了包含八个任务类别的分类法，引入任务锚定功能多样性评估方法，开发任务锚定采样技术，并挑战多样性-质量权衡的传统观点。

Result: 成功实现了在需要多样性的任务类别中增加功能多样性，同时在需要一致性的任务中保持同质化，且不牺牲响应质量。

Conclusion: 任务依赖的方法能更有效地评估和缓解输出同质化问题，为LLM的多样性优化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

Motivation: 现有数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要是英语、缺乏混合人机写作场景，特别是缺少字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段

Method: 构建包含英语和俄语的双语语料库，使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLMs生成文本，提供字符级标注

Result: 成功创建了LLMTrace数据集，支持传统全文分类和新颖的AI生成区间检测任务

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文理论分析了输入扰动对思维链（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明该上界与推理步骤数正相关，且无限长推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明CoT输出受输入扰动显著影响，但缺乏理论解释这种影响如何传播，限制了深入理解和提示优化方法的改进。

Method: 理论推导输入扰动上界，在线性自注意力（LSA）模型中验证理论，并在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果一致，验证了推导的上界与推理步骤数正相关，且输入扰动影响无法通过增加推理步骤完全消除。

Conclusion: 本文为CoT对输入扰动的敏感性提供了理论解释，有助于深入理解推理过程中的扰动传播机制，并为改进提示优化方法提供理论基础。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略语言组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-参数结构的任务上表现不佳

Method: 结合冻结的CLIP视觉变换器与新型张量网络文本编码器，使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解保持模型高效性，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练

Result: 将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系得分分别提升超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著提升视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源环境下多语言AI系统缺乏文化背景数据的问题，探索合成数据在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定维基百科内容生成合成数据，创建Updesh数据集覆盖13种印度语言。

Result: 评估显示生成数据质量高，在15个多语言数据集上的下游评估中，使用Updesh训练的模型在生成任务上显著提升，在低中资源语言中改进最明显。

Conclusion: 有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化基础的方法进行多方面的数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出奉承行为，但目前不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同的过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，在多个模型和数据集上对比奉承性同意、奉承性赞美和真诚同意三种行为。

Result: 发现三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为，且这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 奉承行为对应着不同的、可独立操控的表示，这表明它们是由多个独立机制产生的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种可定制、高性能的强化学习对齐方法，以低成本实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于下一个标记概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来识别视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成内容中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与强VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算量大且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 通过训练传统机器学习模型，基于VLM的下一个标记概率（NTPs）信号进行幻觉检测。NTPs直接量化模型的不确定性，低NTP值与幻觉高度相关。还引入了语言NTPs和VLM幻觉预测分数来增强检测性能。

Result: 实验使用1,400个人工标注的VLM生成语句数据集，结果显示基于NTP的特征是有效的幻觉预测指标，轻量级ML模型能达到与强VLMs相当的检测性能。结合语言NTPs和VLM预测分数能进一步提升检测效果。

Conclusion: NTPs为基础的方法为增强VLMs可靠性提供了简单、轻量级的解决方案，有望在实际应用中替代计算密集的VLM检测方法。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者的设置中面临泛化挑战，传统方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何，通过黎曼高斯混合模型从少量真实样本生成合成书写者和签名特征，然后使用度量学习框架训练相似性判别模型。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下都能实现低错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在黎曼空间生成合成数据对于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，通过优化的扩散变换器和VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统T2I系统功能单一，需要开发一个统一的框架来支持多种图像生成和编辑任务，提升生成AI的交互性和多维创作能力。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量，结合多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务，采用对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等技术加速推理。

Result: 在2K图像生成上推理时间可达1.8秒，在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，支持复杂任务如精确图像编辑和上下文推理。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互和多维的创作工具，推动了生成AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的乳腺癌检测框架，使用半监督方法在有限标注数据下实现高精度检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗效果至关重要。深度学习在医学影像分析中具有潜力，但受限于标注数据不足的问题

Method: 采用对比学习框架，使用ResNet-50在大量未标注乳腺X光片上进行半监督训练，结合相似性指数和各种数据增强技术，最后在小规模标注数据上微调模型

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最优方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决医学影像分析中标注数据不足的问题，在乳腺癌早期检测中表现出色

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型部署成本。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在零样本设置下的性能。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上均失败，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的直接应用存在局限性，需要针对工业场景的特殊性进行优化。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）来解决视觉任务中模块化任务序列的低效问题，通过编码器-解码器框架预计算跨任务特征，实现多任务共享特征空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型多为特定高精度任务定制，在需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用中效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，使多个下游AI模块能在同一特征空间中运行。

Result: 该方法减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，并证明了在NS中能高效执行去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等任务。

Conclusion: NS架构为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，具有更广泛的硬件适应性。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂教师模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练计算能力有限的边缘设备上的较小模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择最有用的图像进行训练。

Result: 在相似的训练负载下，该方法能以最少的数据库查询产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是有效的图像选择策略，可在保持低传输成本的同时优化模型性能。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且无法处理某些复杂场景（如卷袖等风格变化）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本风格指令，无需精确绘制掩码，并可自动化执行多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了最先进的结果和风格控制。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了用户体验，解决了传统掩码方法的局限性，为复杂试穿场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个用于识别篡改指纹的深度学习模型，在SOCOFing数据集上对三个难度级别的篡改指纹实现了高精度识别（96.7%-99.54%），但阈值选择对性能影响极大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹识别在边境控制、法医学和财政准入等应用中面临篡改指纹的挑战，攻击者可能故意修改脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered数据集的三个难度级别（Easy、Medium、Hard）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别上的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%；但当阈值从0.92放宽到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明已准备好用于对安全性和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署，但阈值选择在生物识别系统中至关重要。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision

self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得良好平衡，半监督学习能进一步提升检测性能，但需要更深入研究以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。数据集和软件已公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域（ROI）增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上实现了适度的ROC-AUC改进。


<details>

Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和死亡率降低至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量。

Method: 在训练过程中，使用预计算的、无标签的边界框库中的随机ROI裁剪概率性地替换完整图像，可选抖动增加变异性。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来了适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但PR-AUC持平或略有下降。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在不增加额外标签或修改架构的情况下，在受限环境中增强乳腺X光分类性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 日常环境中镜面反射常见，可提供立体信息，利用反射作为虚拟视图简化成像过程

Method: 设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换，直接生成虚拟视图像素；提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计；支持动态场景逐帧几何恢复

Result: 构建包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集进行定量评估，在真实和合成数据上验证方法有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现稳健的3D重建，兼容前馈重建模型，适用于动态场景

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对于分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空图像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景图像有细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频到地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene后的调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了残余错误发生的位置和原因。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过目标质量控制提高评估准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Motivation: 研究人类在识别简单移动形状中的社交互动时，除了视觉特征外还使用哪些语义表征来补充理解。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记移动形状动画的印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社交互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 人类反应呈分布状态；语义模型在解释人类判断时提供了对视觉特征的补充信息；基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社交感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，连接了视觉和抽象表征。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Conclusion: EGS框架有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨域泛化能力，通过稳定的特征提取和全局-局部一致性机制解决了关键挑战

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双路径边缘网络，通过解耦边缘增强和语义建模来解决红外小目标检测中高分辨率空间细节与鲁棒语义上下文之间的冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显的纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱的噪声背景混合。现有方法依赖固定梯度算子或简单注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声条件下无法准确提取目标边缘

Method: 采用双路径架构：第一条路径使用双向交互模块（局部自注意力和全局自注意力）捕获多尺度特征依赖；第二条路径引入多边缘细化器，使用级联泰勒有限差分算子和注意力门控机制增强边缘细节

Result: 该方法能够精确地进行红外小目标检测和定位，有效抑制噪声，为目标检测提供了有前景的解决方案

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络将结构语义和边缘细化结合在统一框架中，解决了红外小目标检测中的关键挑战

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽视了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了解决这一局限性，需要研究群体意图的识别和预测。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据的稀缺性以及在不同海上属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。特别是在开放海域等代表性不足的场景中，现有数据集训练的模型表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包括两个核心组件：1) X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，通过双向对象-水域注意力模块捕捉目标与水域环境的边界交互；2) 属性相关主动采样方法，根据任务相关性动态选择合成样本。

Result: 实验表明该方法在海上场景合成方面设立了新基准，显著提高了检测准确性，特别是在具有挑战性和代表性不足的场景中。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过数据中心的生成-选择方法有效解决了海上目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为海上视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: STELLA是首个用于长期月球测绘的端到端陨石坑导航（CBN）系统，在稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件下仍能保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBN技术主要针对短期、高频率的着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏图像、倾斜视角和变化光照等更大挑战，需要专门解决方案。

Method: STELLA整合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上测试显示，STELLA在各种视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对CBN进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了可操作的指导条件。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现单模态视觉和语言模型在表示空间中存在部分对齐，这种对齐在模型的中后层达到峰值，反映了从模态特定到概念共享表示的转变。对齐对纯外观变化稳健，但对语义变化敏感，表明共享编码是真正语义的。人类在图像-文本匹配中的偏好与模型嵌入空间中的对齐模式一致，且通过示例聚合可以增强对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度视觉和语言模型在分离的模态上训练，但它们将输入投影到部分对齐的表示空间中。然而，对于这种对齐在网络的哪个位置出现、支持它的视觉或语言线索是什么、它是否捕捉人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及聚合同一概念的示例如何影响对齐，仍缺乏清晰的理解。

Method: 系统研究对齐在视觉和语言模型中的出现位置、对齐的稳健性（针对外观变化和语义变化）、通过强制选择“Pick-a-Pic”任务比较人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的对齐模式，以及研究示例聚合对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中后层达到峰值；对齐对外观变化稳健，但对语义变化（如对象移除或词序打乱）敏感；人类对图像-文本匹配的偏好与所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间中的对齐模式一致；示例聚合增强而非模糊对齐。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享的语义编码，该编码与人类判断一致，并通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在三个主要问题：缺乏对插入对象的几何控制、风格一致性不足、以及需要大量训练。

Method: 通过现有3D生成模型将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容控制。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有精确几何控制和风格一致性的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的对象插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过引入3D几何信息，有效解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化对象插入提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer框架有效解决了现有身份定制模型的问题，实现了高质量、可控的个性化生成，同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision
applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged
in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,
given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a
consolidated platform is needed as a common ground to implement and evaluate
compression methods optimized for downstream vision tasks. CompressAI-Vision is
introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools
compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining
task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Motivation: 传统SSDG方法假设每个源域都有标注和无标注数据，但实践中常出现标注数据和未标注数据之间存在领域偏移的情况。论文探索更实用且具挑战性的CD-SSDG场景，其中训练集内标注与未标注数据间存在领域偏移，且训练与测试集间也存在偏移。

Method: 提出DAC框架，基于两个子模型的协同训练范式，集成了额外的特征级监督和非对称辅助任务。特征级监督解决领域偏移导致的伪标签不准确问题，两个不同的自监督辅助任务增强领域不变特征学习并防止模型坍塌。

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG场景下的挑战，通过双监督机制和非对称辅助任务显著提升了模型在领域偏移情况下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DEIM框架以利用DINOv3特征的强大语义表示能力，同时满足从GPU到移动设备的不同部署场景需求，实现更优的性能-成本权衡。

Method: 1. 对大中型模型(X/L/M/S)采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，引入STA将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；2. 对超轻量模型(Nano/Pico/Femto/Atto)使用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝；3. 结合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O设计。

Result: DEIMv2-X仅用50.3M参数达到57.8 AP，超越需要60M+参数的同类模型；DEIMv2-S成为首个突破50 AP里程碑的sub-10M模型(9.71M参数，50.9 AP)；DEIMv2-Pico仅用1.5M参数实现38.5 AP，性能与YOLOv10-Nano相当但参数减少50%。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的设计框架在不同规模模型上均实现了卓越的性能表现，特别是在参数效率方面显著优于现有方法，为目标检测的实际部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在安全关键应用中广泛使用，但现有的参数高效微调方法仍易受对抗攻击影响，CLIP作为基础模型的安全漏洞会波及整个多模态AI生态系统

Method: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，集成对抗训练到PEFT中，采用智能课程设计逐步增加攻击难度，基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失函数

Result: 在不显著影响清洁准确率的前提下，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA是一种有效、轻量且广泛适用的方法，可轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中显著增强鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Conclusion: FedDSPG方法通过生成式视角有效解决了联邦学习中的领域泛化问题，为下游任务在未知领域的适应提供了新思路

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumbarCLIP是一个新颖的多模态框架，利用对比语言-图像预训练技术将腰椎MRI扫描与相应的放射学描述对齐，在腰椎疾病分类任务上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球数百万人受腰痛困扰，需要能够联合分析复杂医学图像和伴随文本报告的强大诊断模型。

Method: 基于对比语言-图像预训练，整合视觉编码器（ResNet-50、Vision Transformer、Swin Transformer）和基于BERT的文本编码器，通过可学习的投影头将特征投影到共享嵌入空间，使用软CLIP损失进行对比训练。

Result: 在测试集上达到95.00%的准确率和94.75%的F1分数，尽管存在固有的类别不平衡问题。消融研究表明线性投影头比非线性变体产生更有效的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: LumbarCLIP为自动化肌肉骨骼诊断和临床决策支持提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）中提示引导采样策略的黑盒投毒攻击方法，通过闭环优化策略在三个先进VideoLLMs上实现了82%-99%的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视频大语言模型的性能不断提升，从均匀采样到语义相似度采样再到最新的提示引导采样，但早期采样策略已被发现存在漏洞，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: PoisonVID通过闭环优化策略迭代优化通用扰动，利用影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型（GPT-4o-mini）构建的改写有害描述集来抑制有害帧的相关性分数，从而破坏提示引导采样机制。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上的全面评估显示，PoisonVID实现了82%-99%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性，揭示了当前提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数来动态平衡任务特定损失和知识蒸馏损失，解决了低比特量化下梯度幅度异质性问题，显著提升了小型量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，因为梯度幅度存在异质性，导致监督信号冲突和收敛困难。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和大型语言模型压缩任务上，GoR均优于最先进的QAT-KD方法；在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理速度同时保持全精度准确率；EKD-GoR在最优条件下甚至能超越全精度模型。

Conclusion: GoR为资源受限硬件上的AI模型部署提供了鲁棒解决方案，能够有效平衡监督信号冲突，提升小型量化模型的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大规模网络收集的含标签错误的训练数据是否能与专家验证的小规模可信训练数据竞争，以推动自动化植物识别系统的发展。

Method: 使用两个训练数据集：大规模网络收集的噪声数据和专家验证的小规模可信数据，测试数据来自Pl@ntNet移动应用。通过挑战赛形式比较两种训练策略的效果。

Result: 挑战赛结果显示，尽管网络收集的数据存在噪声和标签错误，但在大规模植物识别任务中仍能取得有竞争力的表现。

Conclusion: 网络收集的大规模数据可以作为植物识别系统的重要补充资源，特别是在覆盖稀有物种方面具有优势，但需要有效的噪声处理技术。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性且新品种不断涌现，无法为所有物种建立依赖特定物种的计数模型。现有类无关计数模型对非刚性结构的植物计数效果不佳，需要重新思考植物计数的问题表述。

Method: 基于普通视觉Transformer构建TasselNetV4，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的半监督模型，通过可微分生物标志物拓扑引擎来确保视网膜OCT图像中层和病变分割的解剖学正确性，解决了现有方法产生解剖学不合理分割的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT图像分割中经常产生解剖学不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层-病变相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层和病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集，学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该方法在病变和层分割方面优于当前最先进方法，并能使用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理情况。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒和可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估植物识别方法在大规模真实世界条件下的性能，特别是解决开放集识别问题，即系统需要能够拒绝未知类别的错误分类。

Method: 使用基于大规模参与式感知平台收集的11万张图像数据集，将识别任务作为开放集识别问题进行评估，要求系统不仅能对已知类别进行分类，还要能自动拒绝未知类别的误分类。

Result: 挑战赛成功评估了多种植物识别系统在开放集识别场景下的表现，为大规模生物多样性监测提供了技术参考。

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016挑战赛推动了植物识别技术在大规模开放集识别场景下的发展，为真实世界的生物多样性监测应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA是一种基于知识库的视觉问答方法，通过总结和重新排序图像描述来提升大型语言模型在VQA任务中的推理能力，无需昂贵的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用LLMs作为知识引擎，但图像描述包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练的视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例并对描述进行总结和重新排序，排除无关信息。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，基于6.7B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述重排序过程使LLMs更好地理解图像信息和问题，增强了模型的推理能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

### [103] [The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20878)
*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与图像质量评估之间的不对称性：在IQA中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不一致在对抗训练下更加明显。判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与它们作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 进行系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化和IQA中的表现，研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响，包括patch级和卷积架构与vanilla或Transformer架构的对比。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和感知优化中存在不对称性；判别器能有效抑制优化过程中的伪影，但其学习到的表征在重用为IQA模型骨干初始化时效果有限；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: IOG-VQA模型通过整合对象交互自注意力机制和基于GAN的去偏技术，有效解决了VQA任务中的数据偏差问题，提升了模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏差的影响，过度依赖表面模式，导致对多样化问题和图像的泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，结合对象交互自注意力机制（捕捉图像中对象间的复杂交互）和基于GAN的去偏框架（生成无偏数据分布）。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的实验表明，该模型在处理有偏和不平衡数据分布方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏差对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 将低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样相结合，通过混合框架处理视频数据中的噪声和伪影。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，该方法在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保留（KS统计量）方面均优于传统RPCA。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型和深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出FerretNet，一种轻量级神经网络，通过分析合成图像生成过程中的潜在分布偏差和解码平滑效应，实现高效的合成图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。需要开发新的方法来识别合成图像中的生成伪影。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖性(LPD)特性，通过邻域像素信息重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于LPD构建FerretNet轻量神经网络(仅110万参数)。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中达到97.1%的平均准确率，比最先进方法高出10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析生成过程中的伪影特征，实现了高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测，在跨模型泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，无法有效处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而时间依赖对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 采用transformer架构，设计MoTIF框架处理任意长度的视频序列，将视频中的概念（如物体、属性、动作组件）建模为随时间重复出现的motif模式。

Result: 实验证明概念建模范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能同时，能够更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类领域，为视频理解提供了可解释的分析工具，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

Result: 实验结果表明，粒子滤波器能够有效解决基于相机姿态和图像分割的实际定位任务，在其他方法失败的情况下仍能正常工作。该方法与检测方法无关，具有很好的灵活性。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器是解决3D物体定位问题的有效方法，特别适用于计算资源受限的远距离监测任务。结合现有的图像分割模型，该方法可用于无人机野火监测等实际应用。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，解决Vision Mamba在遥感图像语义分割中忽略局部特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在遥感图像分割中虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但倾向于忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度。

Method: SwinMamba受Swin Transformer启发，在前两个阶段进行局部扫描捕获细节，后两个阶段进行全局扫描融合上下文信息，使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SwinMamba优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过有效结合局部和全局特征感知，为遥感图像语义分割提供了优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度，解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化、数据异质性和冗余的问题，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动的下采样器来提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像存在序列长度极端变化（200-200K）、数据异质性和冗余，以及监督信息有限的问题。传统方法在保持数据异质性的同时往往牺牲训练效率和优化效果。

Method: 1. 打包式MIL框架：将采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列，实现批处理训练；2. 残差分支：将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；3. 注意力驱动下采样器：压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法有效解决了序列长度变化、数据异质性和冗余等问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接整合到去噪过程中，高效生成物理合理的人体运动，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层整合到扩散过程中以确保物理合理性，但这些方法由于模拟器的顺序性质而计算成本高昂，无法并行化。

Method: 将基于模拟器的运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过环境参数（如重力、风力）的条件化，直接在去噪过程中集成物理约束。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: SimDiff成功推广到未见过的环境参数组合，展示了组合泛化能力，为物理合理的人体运动生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Motivation: 研究视觉模型架构设计选择对高斯噪声鲁棒性的影响，将经验观察转化为可操作的设计规则。

Method: 对1,174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别关键设计模式，并开发理论分析解释观察到的相关性。

Result: 发现四种有效设计模式：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化、监督ViT而非CLIP ViT，可提升506个排名和21.6%准确率。理论分析证明这些设计的噪声抑制机制。

Conclusion: 研究将鲁棒性分解为可解释模块，提供理论解释和实用设计指南，帮助构建更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，能够在无需任何先决条件的情况下，使自监督学习（SSL）学习器冷启动用于深度图像聚类。它通过随机采样伪标记数据、学习实例级分类器、跟踪预测类别转换来提取高级相似性，最终触发SSL学习器进行图像聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为先决条件，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；2. 利用实例级分类能力跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高级相似性；3. 将聚类级标签分配给伪标记数据；4. 使用带有聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有微小精度差距（如CIFAR-10上仅差1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需先决条件的冷启动解决方案，使SSL学习器能够灵活应用于图像聚类任务，取得了优异的性能表现，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers作为视觉基础模型的骨干，会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，从而削弱大模型的增益。

Method: 提出SiNGER框架，利用零空间引导的扰动在特征精炼过程中抑制伪影同时保留信息，通过LoRA适配器高效实现扰动，最小化结构修改。

Result: 大量实验表明，SiNGER能持续提升学生模型性能，在多个下游任务中达到最先进水平，并产生更清晰、更可解释的表征。

Conclusion: SiNGER有效解决了知识蒸馏中伪影抑制与信息保留的权衡问题，为视觉基础模型的蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Conclusion: SNCE通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，在安全性和图像质量之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: KD-SS可作为传统密集型预处理和降采样方法的轻量级替代方案，实现植物器官分割而不受物种和传感器模态限制

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: 提出了Mambo框架，通过结合背景提示学习和局部相似性优化，改进少样本分布外检测中的前景-背景分解方法，解决了现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本分布外检测中的前景-背景分解方法存在两个主要问题：过度依赖局部类别相似性导致鲁棒性低，以及固定的背景块提取策略不够灵活。

Method: 1) 学习背景提示获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性；2) 使用局部类别相似性优化局部背景相似性；3) 提出补丁自校准调优，根据样本多样性灵活选择背景块数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置上相比现有最优方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过结合背景相似性和类别相似性，以及灵活的补丁选择策略，显著提升了少样本分布外检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种图像分割数据集划分方法：IPS和WDES，旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性问题，从而提高模型评估的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，产生有偏评估和模型泛化能力差的问题。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡使其难以直接应用。

Method: 1. IPS：基于现有分层概念的简单标签感知采样方法；2. WDES：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分的标签分布相似性。

Result: WDES能持续产生更具代表性的数据集划分，在不同分割任务（街景、医学影像、卫星图像）中降低性能方差并改善模型评估，特别适用于小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集。

Conclusion: WDES方法在优化分割数据集划分方面具有全局最优性，能有效减少评估偏差，特别是在具有挑战性的数据场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net是一种利用语义关联层次结构作为监督信号的端到端深度神经网络模型，用于细粒度分类，无需裁剪技术或手动标注即可达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或自动裁剪方法，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此本文利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联结构化为层次结构（分类法），作为端到端深度神经网络中的监督信号，无需裁剪技术或手动标注。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个知名数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的近期方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号是细粒度分类的有效方法，能够在无需额外标注的情况下实现竞争性性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 本文研究了对抗性补丁在Vision Transformers（ViTs）上的可迁移性，发现CNN的对抗攻击技术可以成功转移到ViT模型，不同ViT模型对攻击的脆弱性差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统的广泛应用，其安全性成为关键问题。Vision Transformers在性能上优于CNN且对对抗性扰动更具鲁棒性，但仍存在被对抗性补丁攻击的漏洞，需要研究CNN对抗攻击技术在ViT上的可迁移性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation（CT）技术设计现实的对抗性补丁，在二分类人物识别任务上测试四个微调ViT模型的脆弱性。

Result: 实验结果显示不同ViT模型的攻击成功率差异显著：从40.04%（google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k）到99.97%（facebook/dino-vitb16），证明对抗性补丁可以从CNN成功迁移到ViT。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗性攻击的抵抗能力，对抗性补丁具有跨架构的可迁移性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer是一种新颖的视频概念迁移架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念转换，包括前景主体、背景和运动流的三重分解，以及基于Chain-of-Prompt的渐进式去噪过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法缺乏精细的组件控制和渐进式生成能力，难以实现高质量的可控视频编辑。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景、背景、运动流）和扩散时间步分解的双重架构，采用双流到单流的DiT架构，结合自监督预训练和Chain-of-Prompt机制进行渐进式生成。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线，能够实现高质量的视频概念迁移。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间分解的联合优化，为视频概念迁移提供了新的解决方案，在保持高质量的同时实现了精细的控制能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为视觉测试时缩放（VTTS）的新方法，通过推理过程中的迭代感知来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力。该方法模仿人类的分层注意力机制，逐步细化对高置信度时空区域的关注，并引入了包含8万样本的VTTS-80K数据集。实验表明该方法在多个基准测试中平均提升超过5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要依赖静态感知阶段来分析视觉内容，这限制了模型的推理能力。为了达到人类水平的感知和理解，需要开发能够进行迭代感知的推理方法。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理过程。该方法通过逐步细化对高置信度时空区域的关注，在推理过程中动态调整感知焦点。

Result: 基于VTTS方法开发的Videochat-R1.5模型在超过15个基准测试中表现优异，相比Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等强基线模型，平均性能提升超过5%，涵盖视频对话、视频推理和时空感知等任务。

Conclusion: VTTS通过引入迭代感知机制有效增强了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，证明了在推理过程中动态调整感知焦点的重要性，为达到人类水平的感知和理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Mammo-CLIP Dissect框架，这是首个用于系统分析乳腺X光片深度学习模型的概念可解释性方法，通过文本概念标记神经元并量化其与领域知识的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型学习的内容对于临床AI安全部署至关重要。现有研究主要关注基于像素的可解释性方法，但较少关注模型学习的文本概念，而这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺X光片专用的视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为“解剖器”，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐度。研究比较了不同训练数据和微调策略下的概念学习差异。

Result: 在乳腺X光片数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，且与放射科医生工作流程更一致。任务特定的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖，表明专业化与泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺X光片特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: 本文提出了MOSS-ChatV框架，通过基于动态时间规整的过程奖励来解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致性问题，显著提升了推理的连贯性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态不符，即使最终答案正确也影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于强化学习的MOSS-ChatV框架，采用动态时间规整的过程奖励机制，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现有效的过程监督。同时构建MOSS-Video基准数据集用于训练和评估。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，且在不同架构模型上均表现出一致性改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升视频推理的过程一致性，具有广泛的适用性，为多模态大语言模型的视频理解能力提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将相机和物体运动分开学习，容易导致相对运动混淆，需要解决相机轨迹引导视频生成中的一致性和泛化性问题。

Method: 将相机和物体运动统一转换为像素运动，使用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动图，结合语义对象先验输入图像到视频网络生成视频。

Result: 大量实验验证，该方法大幅优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一运动表示方法能有效生成准确跟随相机轨迹且保持物体运动一致性的视频。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: CARINOX是一个统一的框架，结合了噪声优化和探索，通过基于人类判断相关性的奖励选择程序，提高文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）在描述复杂对象关系、属性或空间排列时往往无法实现组合对齐。现有的推理时方法各有局限性：优化可能因初始化不良或搜索轨迹不利而停滞，而探索可能需要大量样本来定位满意输出。

Method: CARINOX框架结合了噪声优化和探索，并采用基于与人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序。

Result: 在两个互补的基准测试中，CARINOX将平均对齐分数提高了T2I-CompBench++上的+16%和HRS基准上的+11%，在所有主要类别中一致优于最先进的优化和探索方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一的噪声优化和探索框架，以及原则性的奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像生成AI中判别器最不利的条件，分析了数据维度和复杂度对检测合成图像能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的边界变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探究判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：简单数据集和高度复杂数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对判别器性能有重要影响，极端简单或复杂的数据集都会削弱检测能力，而中等复杂度数据集为检测提供了最有利条件。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时需要重新训练或部署多个模型，计算成本高且不灵活。WAVECLIP旨在开发一个统一模型，能够自适应处理多种分辨率，实现动态的计算-精度权衡。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，构建从粗到细的令牌化处理；采用键值缓存和因果跨层注意力机制重用计算；通过基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应提前退出。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中表现优异，仅需轻量级蒸馏训练，就能在保持竞争力的准确率同时显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP提供了一种高效的自适应分辨率推理方案，通过单一模型实现动态计算优化，为实际部署提供了灵活性和效率优势。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型的可靠性指标，挑战了效率与性能必须权衡的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响（特别是在准确性之外的可靠性指标）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 对CLIP模型进行大规模量化评估，不仅评估分布内准确性，还评估全面的可靠性指标，并研究不同预训练来源的影响。

Result: 量化能持续改善通常欠自信的预训练模型的校准度，但对过度自信的模型可能降低校准度。有趣的是，即使校准度下降，OOD检测性能仍可能提升。某些量化感知训练方法能同时提高零样本准确性、校准度和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化在高效、可靠、鲁棒的视觉语言模型部署中具有超越传统角色的价值，为多目标优化问题提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,

*Iñigo Alonso,Imanol Miranda,Eneko Agirre,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万样本和20个任务，基于200万张真实表格构建，其中88%保留了原始可视化效果。该数据集旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解主要依赖像素级处理，但现有基准多使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性。现有VTU数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新格式化。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含图像-HTML表示对、全面元数据和溯源信息。使用该数据集对Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调的模型在已见和未见VTU任务上表现提升，对真实世界表格可视化的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化和维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形预测的新方法，用于控制图像预测解释的保真度，通过识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征归因方法在鲁棒性和保真度方面存在不足，无法忠实反映黑盒模型的推理过程。

Method: 基于共形预测的方法，提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用五种解释器在六个图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面优于竞争方法，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级度量更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效控制解释的保真度，为图像预测提供更可靠的特征级解释。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Sigma框架，通过骨架数据解决手语理解的三个关键挑战：语义基础弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法存在语义基础弱、局部与全局信息不平衡、跨模态学习效率低三大局限，需要更有效的语义对齐和层次化学习策略。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制；2）层次化对齐学习策略；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译任务上达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Sigma证明了基于骨架数据作为独立解决方案的有效性，以及语义信息丰富的预训练对手语理解的重要性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 该论文对文本到图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动化指标进行了全面研究，分析了这些指标在反映人类判断方面的有效性。研究发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，性能随组合问题的类型而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成技术发展迅速，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 进行了广泛的研究，分析广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标。研究超越了简单的相关性分析，考察了这些指标在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较了不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示：1）没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致；2）VQA-based指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；3）某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强；4）仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了仔细和透明的指标选择的重要性，既是为了可信的评估，也是为了将它们用作生成中的奖励模型。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNNs)进行全切片图像分析，通过熵加权融合策略平衡局部和全局信息，在基因融合预测任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床任务，现有方法在捕捉长程依赖和局部空间关系方面存在局限性

Method: 集成Mamba模块(擅长长程全局依赖)和GNNs(擅长细粒度短程空间交互)，采用基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献

Result: 在基因融合预测任务中，PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等基线方法

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵加权融合策略展现出强大性能，在计算病理学的空间分辨预测建模任务中具有应用潜力

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一框架，用于细粒度可控的3D资产生成，支持多种输入模态（图像、点云、体素、边界框、骨骼姿态），通过跨模态架构和渐进式训练策略实现精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，支持多种条件信号；采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，偏重困难信号（如骨骼姿态）以鼓励鲁棒的多模态融合。

Result: 实验表明额外控制提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过统一框架和先进训练策略，实现了更精细可控的3D资产生成，推动了实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，现有方法依赖专家标注的注意力监督，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到SOTA性能，表现出更好的泛化能力、减少了对捷径的依赖，模型注意力更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的框架，无需人工标注即可实现更可靠和认知合理的模型决策。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research

Conclusion: 该方法通过图像感知的子问题生成机制有效提升了多步推理性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注对齐性，检查提示指定元素是否出现，但忽略了模型超出提示生成的内容。需要明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象。

Method: 提出幻觉的三类分类法：属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉，为评估建立上限并揭示隐藏偏见。

Result: 该框架为T2I模型提供了更丰富的评估基础，能够系统性地识别和分析模型生成中的偏差问题。

Conclusion: 明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类框架为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Result: 在MA-52数据集上实验表明，该框架在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，在细粒度条件下实现稳定泛化

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了微动作识别中的人员间差异问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的泛化能力

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性，通过特征重用、语义头添加和循环一致性训练等策略，在几何感知和匹配可靠性方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：(1) 几何歧义：依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构，需要额外微调但缺乏泛化能力；(2) 最近邻规则：像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体稠密对应机制。

Method: 基于VGGT 3D几何基础模型，通过重用早期特征阶段、微调后期特征、添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下采用循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方案，并缓解混叠伪影。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将3D几何基础模型VGGT适配到语义匹配场景，解决了现有方法的局限性，为语义匹配任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但受硬件和生理限制难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧间突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差和伪影问题

Result: 在四个医学数据集（包括内窥镜和白内障手术）上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和处理效率上显著优于现有VSR模型

Conclusion: MedVSR为医学视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案，能够生成更准确、伪影更少的超分辨率医学视频，有助于提高诊断准确性

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来稳定强化学习微调，解决了GRPO框架中梯度消失问题，同时发布了大规模高质量的多模态推理数据和模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两大限制：缺乏高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，结合Variance Promotion Score (VPS)来提升奖励方差和稳定策略优化。同时发布了~1.6M长链思维数据和~15k RL问答对。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了所提数据和VAS方法的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度幅度，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据选择和算法优化相结合的方式，有效解决了多模态推理模型训练中的关键问题，为社区提供了标准化基准和可复现的训练框架。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，展示了在海洋监测任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且昂贵，而AI基础模型具有改变海洋科学AI应用的潜力，特别是在利用少量高质量标记数据方面。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，然后在下游任务（叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估算）上进行微调评估。

Result: 模型在海洋监测任务中表现出色，特别是在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉海洋颜色详细空间模式方面，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

*Shilin Lu,Zhuming Lian,Zihan Zhou,Shaocong Zhang,Chen Zhao,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像插入，通过利用预训练的扩散模型解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的图像合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入流形导向锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性，同时提出退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench上的实验显示，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够处理复杂光照条件下的高质量图像合成，并引入了新的基准数据集ComplexCompo来推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了QuantVGGT，首个针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样化采样技术，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）计算和内存成本过高，阻碍实际部署。传统后训练量化方法在处理十亿级VGGT时面临数据无关特殊令牌导致的激活分布重尾问题，以及3D数据多视角特性带来的校准样本选择不稳定问题。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样化采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: QuantVGGT在不同基准测试和位宽下达到最先进结果，显著超越之前的通用量化方法。4位量化可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，重建精度保持在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有显著优势和实用性，为大规模3D重建模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)建模牛顿运动，为视频生成过程注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致的视频合成和精确参数控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型常产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落、速度和方向的突变），且缺乏精确参数控制，难以在不同初始条件下生成物理一致的动态效果。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程，联合利用数据先验和动力学指导。

Result: 通过结合数据驱动合成和可学习物理原理，NewtonGen实现了物理一致的视频合成，并具备精确的参数控制能力。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了当前文本到视频生成中物理一致性和可控性的根本限制，通过引入动力学理解改进了视频生成质量。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Conclusion: SD3.5-Flash使先进生成式AI真正实现实用化部署，从手机到台式机的全设备覆盖。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

TL;DR: 传统推荐系统依赖被动反馈机制，无法捕捉用户细微行为动机。本文提出交互式推荐流(IRF)范式，通过自然语言命令让用户主动控制推荐策略，并开发了RecBot双智能体架构来支持这一范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统使用粗粒度的喜欢/不喜欢信号，无法区分具体项目属性对用户满意度的影响，导致用户意图与系统解释之间存在差距，影响用户满意度和系统效果。

Method: 开发RecBot双智能体架构：解析器智能体将语言表达转换为结构化偏好，规划器智能体动态编排自适应工具链进行实时策略调整。采用模拟增强知识蒸馏实现高效部署。

Result: 通过大量离线和长期在线实验，RecBot在用户满意度和业务成果方面均显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: IRF范式通过自然语言交互解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，实现了更准确的用户偏好建模和更好的推荐效果。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球可用性不足，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发基于常规医疗记录的预筛查方法。

Method: 基于数百万电子健康记录建立医疗代码序列预训练的扩展规律，预训练计算最优的基础模型（最大24亿参数），并在临床医生策划的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在3万患者评估中，CATCH-FM达到60%敏感性和99%特异性，大幅优于基于特征的树模型以及通用和医疗大语言模型。在EHRSHOT少样本排行榜上实现胰腺癌风险预测最先进性能。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在不同患者分布中表现出鲁棒性，在ICD代码空间操作具有优势，能够捕获非平凡的癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织希望利用联邦学习框架协作微调大语言模型以保护数据隐私，但现有研究认为联邦学习能保护隐私的假设需要验证。

Method: 通过大量实验验证联邦学习中的数据泄露风险，包括使用简单生成方法和专门设计的增强攻击策略来提取训练数据。

Result: 实验表明联邦学习无法完全保护隐私，攻击者能成功提取训练数据，且模型规模越大泄露越严重。评估了差分隐私等防护措施的效果。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在LLM微调中存在显著隐私风险，需要采用额外的隐私保护技术来降低风险，为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在强化学习优化大语言模型时，由于裁剪机制丢弃了低概率token的梯度信号，导致策略熵管理不佳，影响了探索与利用的平衡

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和有界的方式重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用权衡

Result: 理论分析和实验证明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在不同模型规模的数学推理基准测试中一致优于强基线方法

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制改进了PPO的熵控制能力，为LLM的强化学习优化提供了更有效的探索-利用平衡策略

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用缺乏深入理解，需要系统性的评估框架来指导最优推理策略的选择。

Method: 构建StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上的表现，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 没有单一最优推理风格，搜索类方法在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大模型，简洁风格在定义明确任务上效率更高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随模型规模提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于特定约束选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图，并开源了基准测试工具。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

Motivation: 现有基于定位的方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致过度遗忘或目标知识擦除不完整的问题。

Method: 提出CLUE框架：1）使用电路发现技术识别遗忘和保留电路；2）将电路转化为合取范式；3）通过CNF可满足性解确定神经元应遗忘或保留；4）针对不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过解耦遗忘和保留神经元，提供针对性干预策略，有效解决了LLM知识遗忘中的过度遗忘和不完全擦除问题。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的自编码器变体——二元自编码器(BAE)，通过在小批量隐藏激活上施加最小熵约束，促进特征独立性和稀疏性，解决了现有方法中特征密集化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解构大语言模型隐藏状态时，通常依赖于对单个训练实例的隐式正则化，缺乏对实例间全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出BAE方法：通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1比特，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，在小批量隐藏激活上施加最小熵约束，促进特征独立性和稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解构两方面表现出色：能够可靠估计二元隐藏激活的熵，用于表征LLM的推理动态和上下文学习；在特征提取方面避免密集特征，产生最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，能够解决现有方法中特征密集化的问题，促进特征的独立性和稀疏性。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习机制，发现在零样本场景中语言模型会生成非选择性表示，而通过低秩滤波器选择性移除特定信息能有效引导模型朝向目标任务。研究发现少样本上下文学习模拟了这种任务导向的信息移除过程，并识别出关键的'去噪注意力头'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过信息移除的视角揭示上下文学习的工作机制。

Method: 通过设计度量指标测量隐藏状态，观察少样本上下文学习如何模拟任务导向的信息移除过程。识别关键的'去噪注意力头'，并通过阻断信息移除操作进行消融实验。

Result: 研究表明信息移除机制是上下文学习的关键机制。阻断信息移除操作会导致上下文学习准确率显著下降，特别是在正确标签不在少样本演示中的情况下。

Conclusion: 上下文学习的核心机制是通过选择性移除冗余信息来引导语言模型朝向目标任务，这一过程由特定的去噪注意力头实现。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: DELTA-Code是一个用于评估LLMs能否通过强化学习学习新推理策略的基准测试，重点关注可学习性和可迁移性。实验发现模型会出现顿悟式性能跃升，但在某些迁移场景下仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能真正获取新推理策略（而非仅依赖预训练技能）的开放性问题，需要可控的基准来评估可学习性和可迁移性。

Method: 设计了DELTA-Code基准，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，使用强化学习训练模型，并探索分阶段预热、经验回放等关键训练技术。

Result: 模型在经历长期低奖励后出现顿悟式性能跃升，在家族内和技能重组方面表现良好，但在转化性迁移场景下仍有困难。

Conclusion: DELTA为研究RL驱动推理的极限提供了清晰测试平台，揭示了模型超越现有先验获取新算法技能的潜力与局限。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限等挑战，需要一种更高效的难题生成方案。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题，然后训练专门的难题生成器(DiffGen-8B)进行大规模难题生成。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct模型，性能提升11.3%，在多个数学基准测试上达到65.9%的平均准确率，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型，且随着难题数量增加，模型在困难基准测试上的性能呈现明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个结合领域特定规则的变分自编码器多模态聚类框架，通过将规则作为学习信号直接嵌入表示学习过程，产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉领域关键的结构或语义约束。需要将领域特定约束直接整合到表示学习中。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成并结构化到知识图谱中。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型获得更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但面临LLM规则幻觉、过度规则导致过拟合等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport（双谱最优传输），一种对称感知的离散OT扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，在保持信号结构的同时去除群作用引起的变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征间几何距离的OT对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统OT方法无法有效处理由视觉对称性引起的数据变异。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport方法，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示在保持所有信号结构的同时仅去除由群作用引起的变异。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，与原始特征OT相比，Bispectral OT计算出的传输计划在类别保持准确性方面表现更好，能够捕获数据集中底层语义标签结构的有意义对应关系。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够提高对应关系的质量，在去除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异的同时，更好地保留语义结构。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: FERD是首个公平性增强的无数据鲁棒性蒸馏框架，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决现有方法忽视的鲁棒公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间的鲁棒公平性差异，导致学生模型在不同类别上表现出显著的鲁棒性差异。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略合成更多低鲁棒性类别的样本，并生成公平感知样本(FAEs)和均匀目标对抗样本(UTAEs)来实现更平衡的表示和攻击分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性（如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%）。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了无数据鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是首个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，结合数值序列、元数据、图表图像和描述文本，并提供了新的评估指标和基准测试。

Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，通常忽略元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集构建基准，采用可扩展的管道生成参考描述：大部分由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，还提供579个人工修订的测试描述。

Result: 建立了CaTS-Bench基准，包含460个多项选择题，针对时间序列推理的更深层次方面，并提出了新的定制评估指标。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述管道为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉领域的未来研究建立了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到可穿戴FHR监测设备中，实现更早期和更稳健的风险检测，支持AI风险评估算法开发

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Method: 比较标准主成分分析(PCA)与其稀疏变体(SPCA)作为下游分类器的前端特征提取器，进行理论分析和实验验证。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，实验方面测试了在白盒和黑盒攻击下的性能。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA表现出更优雅的性能下降，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。稀疏投影通过减少对抗性杠杆来提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)是一种有效的对抗性防御方法，理论分析揭示了稀疏投影减少对抗性影响的机制，实验验证了这种优势在线性和非线性设置中都存在。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

Conclusion: f-散度框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更通用的解决方案，超越了传统MSE方法的限制，具有更好的适应性和性能表现。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the

processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms

Motivation: 现有的隐式表面重建方法（如NeuS）需要大量多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: FINS整合了多分辨率哈希网格编码器和轻量级几何/颜色头，利用预训练基础模型估计图像几何信息，通过近似二阶优化器实现高效训练。

Result: 实验表明FINS在相同条件下，在表面重建和SDF场估计的收敛速度和精度上都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: FINS展示了在机器人表面跟随任务中的适用性，并能在多种基准数据集上良好扩展。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在训练超网络方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源，需要开发资源感知的NAS方法以适应机器人边缘设备。

Method: 提出子网互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样子网进行相互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；训练三种机器人边缘硬件的延迟代理预测器来估计推理延迟；使用统一多目标进化搜索平衡精度和延迟。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%到81.4%的top-1准确率；相比基于MobileNetv3的方法，在所有三种硬件类型上的检测和分割推理时间均减少。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，显著降低了模型在机器人边缘硬件上的推理延迟，验证了方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Motivation: 解决从人类视频演示中学习机器人操作任务时的挑战，包括本体差异和关节可行性约束，提供可扩展的学习替代方案

Method: 扩展流匹配到SE(3)空间进行物体轨迹的概率建模，集成抓取相似性、轨迹似然性和碰撞惩罚的统一可微分优化目标

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性，实现了密度感知的模仿避免模式崩溃

Conclusion: JFTO框架成功平衡了可行抓取姿态选择、与演示一致的物体轨迹生成以及无碰撞执行三个目标

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中实验显示语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率均有提升

Conclusion: 该工作开创了SLAM-free、视觉语言驱动的导航新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心映射转向语义驱动决策

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM系统在低纹理环境、尺度模糊和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而现有的基于神经网络的方法虽然能恢复3D场景几何，但往往忽略了多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出分层因子图设计，将Sim(3)视觉对齐约束集成到SE(3)因子图中，支持实时滑动窗口优化和具有激进闭环的全局优化，实现多传感器信息融合。

Result: 在公共基准测试和自收集数据集上的评估显示，相比现有视觉中心的多传感器SLAM系统，在准确性和鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架有效结合了神经网络点云图回归和多传感器融合的优势，为视觉SLAM在挑战性环境中的应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中性能受限于时空不对齐问题，规划器需要基于过去感知数据预测未来动作，导致世界观不一致

Method: 1) TISA模块将初始环境特征投影到一致的自我中心坐标系；2) 运动学动作预测头确保物理可行轨迹；3) DPO多目标后训练提供细粒度学习信号

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上达到89.8 PDMS，在自回归模型中达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: TISA模块有效解决了时空不对齐问题，DPO多目标训练超越了纯模仿学习，为自动驾驶规划提供了更精细的优化方法

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人世界模型存在推理速度慢和生成轨迹物理合理性不足的问题，主要源于逐帧生成方法的冗余计算和忽视关键过渡语义重要性。

Method: 1) 通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别关键帧；2) 训练DiT模型从文本任务描述生成关键帧；3) 使用轻量级插值器高效重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld相比逐帧生成基线实现5.68倍加速，且在复杂任务上显著提升生成视频的物理有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域部署世界模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Keyworld-E43D.

Motivation: 传统机器人教学需要动作演示（遥操作或物理引导），数据收集繁琐且难以扩展，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: CrossInstruct框架将跨模态指令作为上下文输入基础VLM，VLM迭代查询小型微调模型，在多视角2D图像上合成期望运动，然后融合成3D运动轨迹分布

Result: 在基准仿真任务和真实硬件上验证有效性，无需额外微调即可产生可执行行为，并为强化学习提供良好初始化

Conclusion: 该方法能生成超越有限指令示例环境的机器人行为，为下游强化学习提供高效学习基础

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向）的能力，导致在大型环境中导航效率低下。

Method: 设计基于导航地标的紧凑输入输出抽象，让视觉语言模型专注于语言理解和推理，集成人类类似导航技能。

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估显示，ReasonNav能够成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过整合人类类似导航行为，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体强化学习在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用三智能体架构（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可溯源且可预测的上下文，在部署约束下提供可靠的性能表现。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

Conclusion: 研究系统性地证明了模型内部处理架构与其外部说服行为之间的联系，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对未来MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括分数比较不一致和成对传递性不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的框架存在严重的不一致性问题：分数比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递性不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息损失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致率从23.32%降低到14.89%（减少8.43%），成对传递性不一致率从15.22%降低到4.40%（减少10.82%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论见解和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于推理模式价值的数据选择方法，通过识别高价值推理模式来提升大型推理模型的数学推理能力，仅使用100亿token的高价值CoT数据就能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通常不加区分地使用链式思维数据，缺乏对哪些数据类型能最有效增强模型推理能力的研究。论文旨在解决如何选择高价值数据来最大化模型推理潜力的问题。

Method: 首次定义了基础模型的推理潜力，提出从CoT序列中抽象出原子推理模式，构建富含高价值推理模式的核心参考集，并设计了基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法来高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的CoTP数据，就能让850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025挑战上提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地训练模型掌握推理能力，显著提升模型性能，为大规模推理模型的训练提供了新的数据选择策略。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统虽然能够进行信息搜索和创意生成，但用户如何有效控制、引导和批判性评估多个领域专家智能体之间的协作仍待探索。

Method: 开发Perspectra交互式多智能体系统，采用论坛式界面可视化智能体审议过程，支持@提及邀请特定智能体、线程化并行探索，以及实时思维导图可视化论点和推理过程。

Result: 在18名参与者的研究中，与群聊基线相比，Perspectra显著增加了批判性思维行为的频率和深度，引发了更多跨学科回复，并导致更频繁的提案修订。

Conclusion: Perspectra展示了通过支持用户控制多智能体对抗性讨论来构建批判性思维的多智能体工具设计意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了短视频平台上营养和补充剂视频中可信度的包装方式，通过研究权威信号、叙事技巧和盈利模式的交叉点，发现权威线索常与说服性元素和盈利手段结合使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台已成为健康建议的重要来源，但其中混杂着有用、误导性和有害内容。研究旨在理解这些平台上营养和补充剂视频如何包装可信度，而非判断内容真伪。

Method: 收集了152个来自TikTok、Instagram和YouTube的公开视频，采用透明标注流程，整合自动语音识别、原则性帧选择和多模态模型，并对分层子样本进行人工验证。

Result: 发现视频主要由自信的单一主持人在工作室或家庭环境中主导，临床背景罕见。权威线索（如头衔、幻灯片、证书）常与说服性元素（术语、引用、恐惧或紧迫感）和盈利手段（销售链接、订阅呼吁）结合使用。

Conclusion: 参考文献和科学化视觉元素常与情感化和对立性叙事结合，而非体现克制。这揭示了健康内容中可信度包装的复杂机制。

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

TL;DR: RadAgents是一个用于胸部X光片解读的多智能体框架，通过结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，解决了现有方法在临床可解释性、多模态证据融合和跨工具一致性检测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胸部X光片解读方法存在三个主要问题：推理过程缺乏临床可解释性且不符合指南要求；多模态证据融合不足，产生仅基于文本的推理；系统无法检测和解决跨工具不一致性问题，缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出RadAgents多智能体框架，结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，集成基础验证和多模态检索增强技术来验证和解决上下文冲突。

Result: 该方法能够产生更可靠、透明且符合临床实践的输出结果。

Conclusion: RadAgents框架通过多智能体协作和验证机制，显著提升了胸部X光片解读的临床适用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

Motivation: 上下文学习（ICL）已成为自然语言处理和大语言模型应用的重要范式，但其理论机制理解仍然有限，需要深入探究。

Method: 提出对CB-ICL应用于ICL任务的理论分析，包括量化LLM可利用的知识、建立演示样本与查询输入的相似性度量，并探讨演示样本大小和LLM嵌入维度的影响。

Result: 理论分析解释了CB-ICL在少量演示样本下的有效性，提出的相似性度量为模型预训练和提示工程提供了重要指导。

Conclusion: 通过真实数据实验验证了CB-ICL及其相应理论的实用性，为ICL的理论理解和实际应用提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

Motivation: 传统液态金属脱合金相场模型在大尺度或长时间模拟时计算成本过高，需要开发高效的替代模型来加速计算。

Method: 采用条件参数化的全卷积U-Net架构，集成卷积自注意力机制和物理感知填充，通过参数调节实现可变时间步长跳跃和不同合金系统的适应性。

Result: 替代模型在训练区域内相对误差低于5%，在更大域和更长时间的外推预测中误差低于10%，计算速度提升高达16,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了液态金属脱合金相场模型的可扩展高保真外推，将数周的模拟时间缩短至秒级，是该领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Conclusion: HASC与ISO/IEC 42001:2023标准互补使用，可为AI系统提供更大的透明度和问责制。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater

Conclusion: SceneWeaver标志着向通用3D环境生成迈出了重要一步，展示了反射代理框架在场景合成中的有效性

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用SeamGPT进行表面接缝预测，生成语义上有意义的切割接缝；2) 将基于优化方法的粗糙UV与网格输入自动编码器，精炼成艺术家风格的UV图

Result: ArtUV在多个基准测试中表现出色，确保语义一致性和拓扑结构保持，使UV图可直接用于2D编辑

Conclusion: ArtUV可作为专业渲染工具的插件或独立系统，为快速高质量UV生成提供通用解决方案

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Motivation: 现有网格接缝生成方法往往在低失真和少碎片化之间难以平衡，要么产生高失真，要么产生大量分散的岛屿，这阻碍了纹理合成和艺术家工作流程。

Method: 提出SeamCrafter模型，使用双分支点云编码器分离拓扑和几何特征，通过预训练捕获互补信息，然后使用直接偏好优化(DPO)在基于新评估框架构建的偏好数据集上进行微调。

Result: 实验表明SeamCrafter生成的接缝在UV失真和碎片化方面显著优于现有方法，同时保持了拓扑一致性和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: SeamCrafter通过创新的编码器和优化策略，有效解决了网格接缝生成中的失真-碎片化权衡问题，为3D表面参数化提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

*Yuze Wang,Luo Yang,Junyi Wang,Yue Qi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArchGPT是一个多模态建筑视觉问答模型，通过构建Arch-300K数据集解决现有VR/MR/AR系统在建筑领域缺乏可扩展性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VR/MR/AR系统针对建筑环境开发时通常采用硬编码注释和特定任务交互，无法在不同建筑环境中扩展。需要一种可扩展的方法来支持沉浸式建筑探索和解释。

Method: 1) 构建Arch-300K数据集：通过多阶段流程从Wikimedia Commons和旅游照片中筛选建筑图像，使用粗到细策略结合3D重建和语义分割；2) 使用LLM引导的文本验证和知识蒸馏生成可靠问答对；3) 在ShareGPT4V-7B上进行监督微调得到ArchGPT。

Result: 成功构建了包含约315,000个图像-问题-答案三元组的Arch-300K数据集，并训练出ArchGPT模型，为建筑领域的多模态理解提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: ArchGPT和Arch-300K数据集为解决建筑VR/MR/AR系统的可扩展性问题提供了有效途径，支持更广泛的建筑环境沉浸式探索应用。

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种从神经隐式函数中解析提取表面的新方法，避免了传统方法因空间离散化导致的精度损失


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式和隐式3D表示各有优势，需要高效转换。传统方法如Marching Cubes依赖空间分解和采样，存在固定分辨率导致的精度限制

Method: 利用每个神经元对域进行划分的特性，开发深度优先遍历策略来高效追踪编码表面，无需临时空间离散化

Result: 生成的网格忠实捕获网络的完整几何信息，在不同形状和网络架构上实现前所未有的精度，同时保持竞争力速度

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从神经隐式函数到显式表面的高精度解析转换，为3D视觉计算提供了更准确的几何表示

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CHARM提出了一种用于动漫发型建模的参数化表示和生成框架，通过控制点序列表示每个发片，并使用自回归生成方法从图像或点云生成高质量动漫发型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统发型建模方法主要针对真实头发，而动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构化的几何特征，现有技术难以高效处理。现有方法依赖密集网格建模或手工样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合可扩展学习。

Method: CHARM引入基于控制点的紧凑可逆参数化表示，每个控制点仅用五个几何参数编码。基于此表示构建自回归生成框架，将动漫发型视为序列化的"发型语言"，使用transformer模型捕获局部几何和全局拓扑结构。

Result: 构建了包含37K高质量动漫发型的AnimeHair数据集。实验表明CHARM在重建精度和生成质量方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了一个表达能力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持艺术家友好设计和学习生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

*D. Doutsas,B. Figliuzzi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优传输(OT)的新方法，用于解决盲高光谱解混中高度混合数据的问题。该方法通过OT测量目标分布与真实丰度分布之间的差异，并将其作为正则化项加入优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲高光谱解混中高度混合数据导致的丰度矩阵估计不准确问题，传统方法在处理高度混合数据时效果不佳。

Method: 使用最优传输(OT)来约束估计的丰度矩阵分布更接近目标Dirichlet分布，将OT距离作为正则化项整合到优化问题中，采用无监督深度学习方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法在高度混合数据情况下能更好地估计端元，且对目标丰度分布的选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于OT的正则化方法有效提升了盲高光谱解混在高度混合数据场景下的性能，为处理复杂混合数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义级水印方法缺乏强理论鲁棒性保证，且基于拒绝采样的生成方式会导致与无水印输出的显著分布偏差。

Method: 提出代理函数理论框架，通过动态采样估计句子代理函数中位数，并实施多重约束通道来强化水印证据。

Result: PMark在文本质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有基线方法，提供了更有效的机器生成文本检测范式。

Conclusion: PMark通过理论保证实现了无失真水印生成，显著提升了对改写攻击的鲁棒性，为语义级水印提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的遗忘面临挑战，特别是当使用区块链确保完整性时，编辑多个相互关联的区块链记录和更新所有继承模型使过程复杂化。

Method: 提出BlockFUL框架，采用实时链和归档链的双链结构，引入基于梯度上升和重新训练的并行与顺序遗忘方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上使用AlexNet、ResNet18和MobileNetV2模型的实验表明，这些方法有效减少了数据依赖性和操作开销。

Conclusion: BlockFUL框架通过创新的双链结构和遗忘方法，显著提升了区块链联邦学习中继承模型的遗忘性能。

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成验证器的瓶颈问题，提出了验证天花板概念，并探索了通过调整验证策略（如放宽通过标准、使用LLM软验证）来提升模型性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成模型依赖合成数据，但验证器的能力限制了训练数据的质量和多样性，形成了验证天花板瓶颈。

Method: 系统研究验证设计策略：(i)分析测试复杂度和数量的影响；(ii)探索放宽通过阈值和LLM软验证；(iii)比较正确与错误解决方案，进行人工评估。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件平均提升3% pass@1性能；放宽验证标准可回收有价值训练数据，带来2-4点性能提升；保留多样正确解决方案能获得一致泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性，但不能完全丢弃验证，而需要重新校准。结合校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对，可突破验证天花板，开发更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.
