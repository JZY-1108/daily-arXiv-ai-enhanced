*Wei Zhou,Bolei Ma,Annemarie Friedrich,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于表格问答(TQA)的综述研究，系统梳理了基于大语言模型的TQA方法，包括任务分类、建模策略分析和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TQA领域缺乏对任务定义、核心挑战和方法趋势的系统性组织，特别是在强化学习等新兴研究方向出现后，需要统一的框架来理解这一快速发展的领域。

Method: 通过提供全面的TQA研究结构化概述，对现有基准和任务设置进行分类，按目标挑战对建模策略进行分组，并分析其优缺点。

Result: 建立了TQA研究的统一框架，识别了未充分探索但及时的研究主题，为TQA社区提供了整合的基础。

Conclusion: 该综述通过统一分散的研究线索和识别开放问题，使研究者能够更深入地理解TQA的现状，并指导这一快速演进领域的未来发展。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [2] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次计算性地探讨了情感框架与逻辑谬误及说服力的关系，使用LLMs系统性地改变谬误论证中的情感诉求，发现LLM驱动的情感框架使人类谬误检测的F1值平均下降14.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中很常见且可能误导受众，但说服力具有主观性，即使谬误论证也可能显得有说服力。研究旨在探索情感框架如何与谬误和说服力相互作用。

Method: 使用大型语言模型系统性地改变谬误论证中的情感诉求，同时保持逻辑结构不变。首先在8个LLMs上基准测试情感注入能力，然后用最佳模型生成人类研究刺激材料。

Result: LLM驱动的情感框架显著降低了人类对谬误的检测能力（F1值平均下降14.5%）。人类在感知愉悦情绪时比恐惧或悲伤时更能检测谬误，而愉悦、恐惧和悲伤这三种情绪与显著更高的说服力相关。

Conclusion: 这项工作对AI驱动的情感操纵在谬误论证背景下的应用具有重要意义，揭示了情感框架如何影响人们对逻辑谬误的识别能力和说服力感知。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

### [4] [SeCon-RAG: A Two-Stage Semantic Filtering and Conflict-Free Framework for Trustworthy RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710)
*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段语义过滤和冲突消除框架SeCon-RAG，通过语义过滤和冲突感知过滤来防御检索增强生成系统中的语料库污染攻击，在保持有用知识的同时提高生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成系统容易受到语料库污染和污染攻击，现有防御方法通常采用激进过滤，导致有价值信息丢失和生成可靠性降低。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE指导的语义和聚类联合过滤，提取实体、潜在目标和实体关系；第二阶段使用EIRE指导的冲突感知过滤模块，分析查询、候选答案和检索知识之间的语义一致性。

Result: 在各种LLM和数据集上的广泛实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法，在保持有用知识的同时有效减轻冲突污染。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段过滤过程，在保持有用知识的同时有效减轻冲突污染，显著提高了生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

### [5] [ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09711)
*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM是一个新颖的KG补全框架，通过残差向量量化将KG嵌入转换为紧凑代码序列，并与LLM词汇表集成，解决了传统嵌入方法与LLM离散标记空间不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KG补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散标记空间存在根本性不匹配，这阻碍了有效的语义传递并限制了性能。

Method: 使用残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列，并将其作为可学习标记集成到LLM词汇表中；同时引入本体引导的类别约束来增强语义一致性。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能，证实了其在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ReaLM通过桥接KG嵌入和LLM标记化之间的差距，成功实现了符号知识和上下文知识的无缝融合，为KG补全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

### [6] [All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09714)
*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在加密推理方面存在不对称性：虽然能准确翻译密文，但在密文中进行推理时准确率显著下降，这为逃避思维链监控提供了可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛采用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。思维链监控是常用方法，但攻击者和错位模型可能通过加密推理来逃避监控。

Method: 对28种不同密码，通过微调和提示最多10个模型在密文中进行推理，使用数学问题作为推理能力的代理指标。

Result: 模型在密文推理中的准确率显著下降，即使能准确翻译密文。前沿模型对不常见密码表现不佳，加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码的普遍性相关。

Conclusion: 当前模型使用加密推理逃避思维链监控可能无效，研究为约束未来前沿模型发展这种能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

### [7] [Preference-Aware Memory Update for Long-Term LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09720)
*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种偏好感知记忆更新机制(PAMU)，通过滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均的融合来动态优化LLM代理的长期记忆表示，显著提升了对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理的长期记忆机制在存储和检索方面已有改进，但缺乏动态更新能力，无法适应用户行为和上下文的演变，导致记忆表示不够个性化。

Method: 提出PAMU机制，结合滑动窗口平均(SW)捕捉短期波动和指数移动平均(EMA)捕获长期趋势，构建融合的偏好感知表示，实现动态个性化的记忆精炼。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景上进行实验，结果显示该机制在五个基线模型上都能显著提升LLM的输出质量，验证了其在长期对话中的有效性。

Conclusion: PAMU机制通过动态记忆更新有效解决了现有方法的不足，为LLM代理提供了更适应性的长期记忆能力，提升了对话系统的性能。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

*Fanwei Zhu,Jinke Yu,Zulong Chen,Ying Zhou,Junhao Ji,Zhibo Yang,Yuxue Zhang,Haoyuan Hu,Zhenghao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个布局感知且效率优化的自动化简历信息提取框架，解决布局异构性、LLM高成本延迟、缺乏标准化数据集三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取对人才招聘规模化至关重要，但面临简历布局内容极度异构、大语言模型高成本延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具三大挑战。

Method: 结合微调布局解析器标准化文档格式、基于并行提示和指令调优的高效LLM提取器、以及由新基准数据集支持的两阶段自动化评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明该框架在准确性和效率上显著优于强基线，特别是微调的0.6B紧凑LLM在实现顶级准确性的同时大幅降低推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该系统已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其各业务部门的实时应用。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

### [9] [VisRAG 2.0: Evidence-Guided Multi-Image Reasoning in Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09733)
*Yubo Sun,Chunyi Peng,Yukun Yan,Shi Yu,Zhenghao Liu,Chi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来减少幻觉并增强推理能力，使用RS-GRPO训练方法在多个视觉问答基准上平均提升27%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面不可靠，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论，需要改进多图像证据感知和整合能力。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架：先观察检索图像并记录每张图像证据，然后从聚合证据推导最终答案。使用RS-GRPO训练方法，将细粒度奖励绑定到范围特定token来联合优化视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比基础VLM平均提升27%性能，能够精确感知和定位问题相关证据，并基于证据推导最终答案。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过证据引导的多图像推理显著提升了视觉问答性能，RS-GRPO训练方法有效提升了模型的视觉感知和推理能力，类似于真实侦探的推理过程。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

### [10] [Judge's Verdict: A Comprehensive Analysis of LLM Judge Capability Through Human Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09738)
*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一种评估LLM作为响应准确性评估法官的两步方法，测试了54个LLM在RAG或Agentic管道响应评分中复制人类判断的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相关性分析不足以全面评估LLM作为法官的性能，需要更全面的方法来衡量实际一致性模式。

Method: 两步方法：1) 相关性测试筛选对齐度高的法官；2) 使用z分数的人类相似性测试，识别人类式判断(|z|<1)和超一致判断(z>1)两种模式。

Result: 54个LLM中27个达到Tier 1性能：23个展现人类式判断模式，4个展现超一致行为。模型性能不单纯依赖规模，而是特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 相关性单独不足以评估法官性能，需要基于一致性模式的"法官图灵测试"，并提供标准化基准将LLM法官分类到不同性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

### [11] [Gold Panning: Turning Positional Bias into Signal for Multi-Document LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09770)
*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排序文档来高效识别最相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档情境中存在强烈的位置偏见，系统性地基于位置而非相关性来优先处理信息。现有方法将这种偏见视为需要缓解的噪声，而本文则将其转化为可利用的诊断信号。

Method: 将选择重新排序的问题构建为二分图匹配问题。提出贪心O(N log N)策略，通过将最不确定的文档放置在最具信息量的位置来实现可比性能，避免使用O(N^3)的匈牙利算法。

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务中，相比随机排列基线，该方法使用高达65%更少的语言模型查询来识别相关文档，显著降低计算成本且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转化为资产，用于实现高效的推理时优化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

*Rakib Hossan,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个用于孟加拉语仇恨言论分类的少样本框架，结合卡方统计分析和自适应多数投票，在BLP-2025 Task 1A中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，对于低资源语言如孟加拉语成本高昂，因此开发少样本学习框架。

Method: 使用卡方统计进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票机制进行决策，探索统计关键词选择与随机方法的对比。

Result: 微F1得分达到67.61，优于n-gram基线(60.75)和随机方法(14.65)，卡方关键词在所有类别中表现最一致。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提取提供跨类别的持续改进，自适应投票对需要扩展分类轮次的模糊案例有益。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

*Michael Freenor,Lauren Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE方法通过旋转操作在嵌入空间中表示语义转换，在跨语言和跨模型场景中保持一致性，验证了句子级别的线性表示假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对于模型可解释性和控制至关重要，但现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何特性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)，利用现代语言表示的流形结构，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中的一致旋转操作。

Result: 在3个嵌入模型、3个数据集和7种形态多样语言的评估中，RISE能够一致地映射具有不同语法特征的语篇级语义转换。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明语篇级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中的一致几何操作，为句子级别的线性表示假设提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有营养问答方法面临单智能体系统推理能力有限和多智能体架构设计复杂的问题，以及上下文过载阻碍准确决策的挑战。

Method: 将智能体节点集成到异构知识图谱中，使用图神经网络学习任务感知的路由分布，并采用基于梯度的子图检索机制识别关键证据。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的实验表明，NG-Router始终优于单智能体和集成基线方法。

Conclusion: NG-Router为复杂营养健康任务提供了一种基于领域感知的多智能体推理原则性方法。

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

*Sil Hamilton,Matthew Wilkens,Andrew Piper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NarraBench提出了一个基于理论的叙事理解任务分类法，并调查了该领域的78个现有基准，发现当前评估在叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等方面存在严重不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前叙事理解任务的评估存在显著空白，许多重要方面被忽视或与现有指标不匹配，需要开发能够评估主观性和视角性方面的基准。

Method: 开发了理论指导的叙事理解任务分类法，并对78个现有基准进行了系统性调查和分析。

Result: 发现只有27%的叙事任务被现有基准充分覆盖，叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等关键领域几乎缺失。

Conclusion: 该分类法、调查和方法论对NLP研究人员测试LLM的叙事理解能力具有重要价值，强调了开发主观性和视角性评估基准的必要性。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

*Nafiseh Nikeghbal,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoBia是一个轻量级对抗攻击套件，通过构建包含偏见声明的对话来测试LLMs在对话中偏离规范行为的条件。评估显示LLMs经常无法拒绝偏见后续问题，揭示了深度嵌入的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs通过了标准安全检查，但在对话中仍会表现出有害行为（如种族主义观点）。需要系统性地分析LLMs在何种条件下会偏离规范行为。

Method: CoBia创建包含模型发表偏见声明的构造对话，然后评估模型是否能从虚构的偏见声明中恢复并拒绝偏见的后续问题。评估了11个开源和专有LLMs在6个社会人口类别上的表现。

Result: 目的性构造的对话可靠地揭示了偏见放大，LLMs在对话中经常无法拒绝偏见后续问题。基于LLM的偏见指标与人类判断对比显示模型的可靠性和对齐性存在不足。

Conclusion: 这种压力测试突显了通过交互可以揭示深度嵌入的偏见，表明当前LLMs在对话安全方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

### [18] [iBERT: Interpretable Style Embeddings via Sense Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09882)
*Vishal Anand,Milad Alshomary,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iBERT是一种可解释的BERT编码器，通过稀疏非负混合的上下文无关意义向量来表示输入token，生成可解释且可控的嵌入表示，能够模块化地展示语言中的判别性线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统BERT模型缺乏可解释性和可控性的问题，作者希望开发一个能够模块化暴露语言中风格和语义结构等判别性线索的编码器。

Method: 使用稀疏非负混合的上下文无关意义向量表示每个输入token，这些向量可以池化为句子嵌入或在token级别直接使用，实现表示的可控性。

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，相比SBERT基线模型，iBERT在风格表示效果上提升了约8个百分点，同时在作者验证任务上保持竞争力。模型能够将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定的意义向量。

Conclusion: iBERT通过结构化模块化设计，能够可解释地分解数据中存在的判别性信号，即使监督信号混合了风格和语义因素，也能实现良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的高效稀疏注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分为三组（全注意力层、选择层、稀疏注意力层）来减少推理计算成本，在保持精度的同时实现1.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要对整个序列进行注意力计算，计算成本高昂。现有稀疏注意力方法在推理任务上存在精度下降问题。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组：初始全注意力层、选择层（通过聚合注意力分数识别关键token）、稀疏注意力层（仅关注选定子集）。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准测试中，DELTA达到或超过全注意力的精度，同时减少5倍注意力token数量，实现1.5倍端到端加速。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图为高效长上下文推理提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

### [21] [Abductive Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09887)
*Yijin Ni,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出溯因偏好学习，通过反转传统条件学习来改进大型语言模型对反事实提示的敏感性，解决现有偏好学习方法忽视提示差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍存在过度自信问题，无法区分反事实提示之间的细微差异，这源于传统偏好学习只关注给定提示下的正确响应选择，而忽视了应该改变响应的反事实提示。

Method: 提出溯因偏好学习范式，通过反转传统条件学习来学习给定响应下的提示偏好，构建了包含1001个条目的溯因数据集，实现了溯因DPO及其变体DPOP。

Result: 实验显示多任务DPOP在溯因数据集上将响应选择准确率从90.0%提升至99.5%，提示区分准确率从54.7%提升至85.0%，在AlpacaEval上的胜率从5.26%提升至6.17%。

Conclusion: 溯因偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，有效解决了反事实提示这一被忽视的挑战，提高了模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在性格检测中难以捕捉跨多篇文章的上下文信息，且在语义稀疏环境中提取代表性特征的能力不足。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟大脑皮层进行全局语义推理，动态记忆模块模拟前额叶皮层进行特征选择，轻量级专业模型模拟基底神经节通过赢家通吃机制捕获性格模式。

Result: 在Kaggle和Pandora数据集上的广泛实验表明，HIPPD持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 受大脑启发的层次信息处理框架为性格检测提供了有效解决方案，能够更好地处理上下文信息和提取鲁棒特征。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出Switch Generation方法，通过让预训练模型和对齐模型在生成过程中交替发言，实现模型协作，从而结合两者的优势，在保持推理和指令跟随能力的同时不损失创造性和校准能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对齐训练存在权衡：虽然能提升语言模型的推理和指令跟随能力，但可能损失创造性和校准等技能。作者希望通过模型协作来结合不同模型的优势。

Method: 提出Switch Generation方法，训练一个切换器语言模型，学习在不同查询和上下文中选择不同模型生成下一个片段。推理时，切换器指导不同模型检查点在各自优势领域动态生成内容。

Result: 在18个数据集上的实验表明：1）模型协作在16个任务上持续优于单个模型；2）Switch Generation比基线方法平均提升12.9%。该方法还能发现组合技能来解决单个模型难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: Switch Generation能够有效利用训练过程中通常被丢弃的副产品，泛化到未见过的模型和任务，实现模型能力的互补和增强。

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过微调策略减少LLM生成摘要中不忠实内容的方法，提出了包含忠实和不忠实摘要的新数据集，并评估了三种微调技术来提升摘要忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型能够生成流畅的摘要，但常常会产生不忠实的内容，在词汇、短语或概念层面引入幻觉。现有的缓解策略无法完全解决LLM生成摘要中的多样化错误。

Method: 首先使用多种LLM为训练集中的源文档自动生成摘要，然后使用GPT-4o在span级别标注检测到的幻觉。利用这些标注，通过梯度上升、非似然训练和任务向量否定三种技术微调LLM。

Result: 实验结果表明，所有三种方法都能成功利用span级别标注来提升忠实度，其中非似然训练效果最佳。

Conclusion: 通过span级别的幻觉标注和适当的微调策略，可以有效提升LLM生成摘要的忠实度，非似然训练是最有效的方法。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个仇恨表情包检测框架，通过建模预设上下文和检测虚假主张来识别仇恨表情包，在多个数据集和指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仇恨表情包检测方法主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学见解，作者认为仇恨表情包具有两个基本特征：预设上下文和虚假主张表达。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含PCM模块（建模多模态上下文信息）和FACT模块（整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假主张）。

Result: 大量实验表明SHIELD在多个数据集和指标上优于最先进方法，并在其他任务如假新闻检测中表现出通用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD通过捕捉仇恨表情包的基本性质，有效提升了检测性能，并展示了在其他相关任务中的适用性。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分词器评估指标STRR，揭示了现有分词器在跨语言公平性方面的系统性问题，特别是对英语的优先处理和对印地语等语言的分割问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词评估指标fertility只关注压缩效率，但掩盖了词汇表在不同语言和领域间的分配差异，无法反映跨语言公平性。

Method: 分析了6个广泛使用的分词器在7种语言和2个领域中的表现，提出了单标记保留率(STRR)作为新的评估指标来衡量单词被保留为单个标记的比例。

Result: 发现英语分词稳定性高，中文分词标记数多，印地语存在严重分割问题。STRR指标显示分词器系统性地优先处理英语，对中文支持较好，但对印地语等语言存在不公平。

Conclusion: STRR指标补充了fertility的不足，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Motivation: 当前审慎树搜索领域缺乏统一的形式化框架，特别是在奖励信号的角色上存在模糊性——它是瞬时启发式还是持久学习目标？本文旨在解决这种模糊性。

Method: 引入统一框架将搜索算法分解为三个核心组件：搜索机制、奖励制定和转移函数，并建立搜索指导与参数奖励建模之间的正式区分。

Result: 提出了基于组件的分类法，综合了最先进技术，并为创建自主、自我改进的智能体制定了研究路线图。

Conclusion: 该框架为审慎树搜索领域提供了系统化的理论基础，有助于推动更系统的研究进展，特别是在自主自我改进智能体的开发方面。

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译方法使用语音令牌作为中间表示，但单个令牌语义密度不足，需要多个令牌才能表达完整语义单元。

Method: 提出MTP-S2UT损失，在计算CTC损失的隐藏表示层应用多令牌预测损失，使模型能在每个位置预测多个后续令牌，提前实现信息丰富化。

Result: 实验表明所有MTP损失变体都能持续改善S2UT翻译质量，其中MTP-S2UT实现最佳性能。

Conclusion: 在中间层应用MTP损失可以更早、更有效地增强隐藏表示，显著提升语音到单元翻译的性能。

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

### [30] [Beyond the limitation of a single query: Train your LLM for query expansion with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10009)
*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ExpandSearch方法，通过强化学习训练LLM搜索代理，具备查询扩展能力，在多个查询变体同时搜索以覆盖更多相关信息。引入预训练压缩器模型帮助理解检索文档，使小型3B LLM也能在复杂多跳QA任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理增强搜索代理（如Search-R1）在推理和搜索能力有限，多跳QA基准测试表现不佳。处理复杂复合查询时，需要更好的查询扩展和文档理解能力。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLM搜索代理，每轮生成多个查询变体并行搜索。引入预训练压缩器模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成以提高检索召回率。

Result: 在7个QA基准测试中，ExpandSearch相比SOTA基线平均提升4.4%，在多跳推理任务上表现尤其突出，需要多样化证据聚合。

Conclusion: 即使使用小型3B LLM，借助压缩器模型的辅助，也能在查询扩展方面展现强大能力，在多跳QA基准上实现最先进精度。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现大型语言模型在长链思维推理中存在路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹会偏离安全对齐路径，导致违反安全约束的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛用于复杂推理任务，长链思维提示成为关键推理范式。尽管有RLHF等对齐技术提供早期保护，但发现推理轨迹可能偏离对齐路径的安全漏洞。

Method: 通过实证分析识别三种路径漂移行为触发因素，并构建包含认知负荷放大、自我角色启动和条件链劫持的三阶段路径漂移诱导框架。

Result: 每个阶段都能独立降低拒绝率，组合使用时效果更强。为缓解风险提出路径级防御策略，包括角色归因修正和元认知反思。

Conclusion: 研究强调在长形式推理中需要超越词元级对齐的轨迹级对齐监督。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医疗场景下使用轻量级编码器进行医学摘要分类，发现DistilBERT在交叉熵损失下表现最佳，提供了实用的部署建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗场景部署面临成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要探索轻量级解决方案。

Method: 使用医学摘要语料库，在固定参数下微调BERT base和DistilBERT，比较三种损失函数：标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失。

Result: DistilBERT在标准交叉熵损失下在测试集上表现最佳，且参数数量远少于BERT base。

Conclusion: 建议从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，添加校准和任务特定检查后再考虑更重的模型。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUME框架首次系统测量了人类在文本嵌入任务上的表现，为模型性能提供了可解释的基准。人类平均表现77.6%，略低于最佳模型的80.1%，但在不同数据集上差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型评估框架缺乏可靠的人类性能基准，限制了模型分数的可解释性。需要填补人类在嵌入任务上表现测量的空白。

Method: 开发HUME评估框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义相似性任务，覆盖高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现77.6%，最佳模型80.1%。模型在某些数据集上接近天花板性能，但在其他数据集上表现不佳，特别是在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: HUME提供了人类性能基准、任务难度洞察和可扩展评估框架，使模型性能解释更有意义，并指导模型和基准的发展。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP模型的可解释性，特别是在医疗和金融领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型在NLP中要么使用二进制激活损害文本表示，要么使用潜在概念削弱语义，且很少建模动态概念交互如否定和上下文。

Method: CLMN将概念表示为连续、人类可读的嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，增强原始文本特征并自动推导可解释逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法获得更高准确率，同时提升解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

TL;DR: Unilaw-R1是一个专为法律推理设计的7B参数大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略在权威基准测试中表现出色，性能与更大的模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理型LLM在法律领域的复杂问题处理能力不足，存在法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱三大挑战。

Method: 构建高质量法律推理数据集Unilaw-R1-Data（17K CoT样本），采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在权威基准测试中超越同规模所有模型，与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B（54.9%）性能相当；在LawBench和LexEval上平均超出Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct 6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1证明了轻量级模型通过专门训练可以在法律推理任务中取得优异表现，为法律AI应用提供了可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过显式建模用户提示背后的潜在意图，解决了现有方法忽视少数意见和用户潜在意图的问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法如DPO往往默认多数观点，忽视了少数意见，且无法捕捉用户提示中的潜在意图。人类偏好具有多样性和动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: A-IPO引入意图模块来推断每个用户提示背后的潜在意图，并将推断的意图显式纳入奖励函数，通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边界，实现更清晰的首选和非首选响应分离。

Result: 在三个基准测试中取得显著改进：Real-pref上胜率提升24.8，响应意图一致性提升45.6；Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6，防御成功率提升52.2；GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模多样用户意图，A-IPO促进了多元偏好优化，同时增强了偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在实证评估中持续超越现有基线。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

TL;DR: 提出了PerAugy数据增强技术，通过跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动来提升个性化摘要模型的性能，显著提高了用户编码器的准确性和个性化摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有数据集缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动的数据增强技术PerAugy，提升用户编码器的准确性，并引入三个数据集多样性指标来量化增强效果。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四个SOTA用户编码器的准确性（最佳AUC提升0.132），增强后的摘要框架个性化程度平均提升61.2%。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性是驱动性能提升的关键因素，TP和DegreeD指标与用户编码器性能强相关，证实了数据增强在个性化摘要中的重要性。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN是一个无需训练的自适应推理框架，通过两阶段停止判别器和滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器来动态确定何时停止推理，以减少过度思考问题，在保持或提高准确性的同时显著降低token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLMs在推理任务上的表现，但过度或冗余的推理会增加推理成本并可能导致错误结论，需要解决"何时停止推理"的问题。

Method: REFRAIN集成了两阶段停止判别器来识别反射性但冗余的推理，以及滑动窗口UCB多臂老虎机控制器来根据问题难度动态调整停止阈值，无需监督或微调。

Result: 在四个代表性基准测试和两个模型系列上，REFRAIN相比标准CoT提示减少了20-55%的token使用量，同时保持或提高了准确性。消融和鲁棒性分析表明其在不同模型、评分器和提示变体下都具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明"何时停止"是测试时扩展的一个新且实用的维度，使模型能够进行恰到好处的推理而非过度推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在处理大规模非结构化语料时效果有限，而现有的图增强RAG方法依赖不稳定且昂贵的关系提取，构建的图存在噪声关系，影响检索质量。

Method: 使用轻量级实体提取和语义链接构建无关系层次图（Tri-Graph），采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，然后通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型，能够实现可靠的图构建和精确的段落检索。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的图构建方法，能够线性扩展语料规模且不消耗额外token，为复杂推理任务提供更全面的检索支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中大量结构相似内容的信息提取这一关键但研究不足的挑战，优化重复性文档提取任务中的准确率-效率权衡。

Method: 结合OCR引擎和LLM，通过智能策略选择利用文档特定特征，实现三种提取范式（直接、替换和基于表格）的25种配置，支持四种格式文档处理。

Result: 基于表格的提取方法在结构化文档中实现F1=1.0准确率和0.97秒延迟，在图像输入中实现F1=0.997准确率和0.6秒延迟，相比多模态方法性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 重复性文档处理任务可以通过结构感知方法选择将计算负担转化为优化机会，该框架为异构文档流的大规模处理提供了通用原则。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

TL;DR: DiffHeads是一个轻量级的LLM去偏框架，通过识别DA和CoT提示策略下激活差异的注意力头，选择性屏蔽这些偏置头来减少模型不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注偏置输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的深入理解，导致去偏方法脆弱。需要系统研究LLM不公平性机制并开发有效去偏方法。

Method: 1. 比较DA和CoT提示策略对8个代表性LLM的影响；2. 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪注意力头影响；3. 提出DiffHeads框架，通过DA和CoT的激活差异识别偏置头并选择性屏蔽。

Result: DA提示会触发LLM的自然偏置，使不公平性增加534.5%-391.9%；发现一小簇偏置头在DA下激活但在CoT下休眠；DiffHeads在DA和CoT下分别减少不公平性49.4%和40.3%，且不影响模型效用。

Conclusion: DiffHeads通过因果机制分析识别偏置头，提供了一种轻量级有效的LLM去偏方法，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少不公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

TL;DR: BILLY是一个无需训练的单模型框架，通过在激活空间中提取和混合多个不同角色向量，实现多LLM协作的优势，显著降低计算成本和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多LLM系统虽然能增强语言模型的创造力，但存在计算成本高、推理延迟大的问题，需要找到在单模型中实现多模型协作效果的方法。

Method: 在模型激活空间中提取多个不同角色向量并混合，使用这个合并向量在推理过程中引导模型生成，实现多视角输出而无需多LLM通信。

Result: 在面向创造力的基准测试中，BILLY超越了单模型提示和传统多LLM方法，同时大幅减少了推理时间和计算成本。

Conclusion: 不同角色向量的混合能够有效控制生成的互补方面，并提高可解释性，为单模型实现多LLM协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by
simulating human collective intelligence but suffer from significant drawbacks,
such as high computational costs and inference latency. To address these
limitations, we propose BILLY (BlendIng persona vectors for Large Language
model creativitY), a training-free framework that captures the benefits of
multi-LLM collaboration, i.e. inducing diverse perspectives and specialized
expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统调查了大型语言模型生成内容的溯源追踪方法，从模型和数据两个角度提出了四个相互关联的维度，并建立了先验和后验两种溯源范式的分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs从支持客观任务转向赋能主观决策，其部署带来了多方面的风险，如幻觉、偏见、不公平和版权侵权等。由于LLMs的黑盒特性和生成内容的人类化质量，从多角度溯源信息变得至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个系统性框架，围绕四个维度组织溯源追踪：模型溯源（区分LLM生成与人类创作）、模型结构溯源（分析内部生成机制）、训练数据溯源（内部归因）和外部数据溯源（外部验证）。同时建立了先验和后验两种溯源范式的分类法。

Result: 建立了一个全面的溯源追踪框架，能够从模型和数据两个角度系统分析LLM生成内容的来源，增强了LLM部署的透明度、问责制和可信度。

Conclusion: 跨这些维度的可追溯性增强了LLMs在现实世界应用中的透明度、问责制和可信度，为解决LLM部署中的风险提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体医疗咨询系统评估主要关注最终答案准确性，忽视了内部协作过程的可解释性，这在高风险医疗应用中存在重大风险。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合定性分析和定量审计，对来自六个医疗数据集的3600个案例和六个代表性多智能体框架进行了大规模实证研究。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主要失败模式：由共享模型缺陷驱动的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，迫切需要透明和可审计的推理过程，这是负责任开发和部署医疗AI的基石。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中训练数据往往包含噪声标签，传统方法通过小损失样本选择进行训练，但初始选择不准确会形成恶性循环，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Delora框架：1）引入干净和噪声LoRA建立噪声标签检测器；2）利用记忆效应，干净LoRA记忆干净数据，噪声LoRA记忆误标数据作为可学习阈值；3）使用精选样本无缝微调语言模型。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上的实验表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类方面具有显著效果。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择和模型训练，有效解决了噪声标签学习中的恶性循环问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

TL;DR: SyTTA是一个无需标注数据的测试时自适应框架，通过结合输入侧困惑度和输出侧预测熵两种不确定性信号，在分布偏移下提升语言模型的领域适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业领域部署的语言模型面临显著的数据分布偏移，而领域特定微调需要昂贵的高质量标注数据，在专业知识有限的环境中收集缓慢。

Method: SyTTA框架在推理时动态自适应，耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（反映与领域特定术语和模式的失配）和输出侧预测熵（反映生成过程中令牌概率的扩散和不稳定性）。

Result: 在不同模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA带来了一致的性能提升。在农业问答任务上，Qwen-2.5-7B模型的Rouge-LSum指标提升了超过120%，每个查询仅需4个额外令牌。

Conclusion: 无需标注示例即可实现语言模型的有效测试时自适应，支持在标注稀缺领域的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 研究发现高质量文本表示与输入文本的关键token对齐，揭示了表示空间和词汇空间的潜在联系，这启发了作者重新审视生成任务并开发无监督生成框架。

Method: 基于token目标预测任务，使用精心构建的目标token分布作为监督信号。通过分析token对齐特性，识别出两类关键token：文本中有意义的token和文本之外的语义衍生token，并提出了数据驱动和模型衍生两种方法来构建合成token目标。

Result: 在MTEB v2基准测试中，Text2Token实现了与使用无监督对比学习的最先进嵌入器LLM2Vec竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 分析表明词汇空间和表示空间在训练过程中共同优化并趋向最优解，为未来工作提供了新的思路和见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Motivation: 解决当前共指消解研究的困境：是继续探索基于小语言模型的监督神经方法，还是拥抱大语言模型的能力。有效结合两者优势的研究仍不足。

Method: 1) 改进的监督模型ImCoref：引入轻量级桥接模块增强长文本编码，设计双仿射评分器全面捕捉位置信息，采用混合提及正则化提高训练效率；2) LLM作为多角色检查器-分割器：验证候选提及和共指结果，过滤无效提及并分割错误聚类。

Result: 广泛实验证明ImCoref-CeS的有效性，相比现有最先进方法实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: ImCoref-CeS成功整合了监督神经方法和LLM推理的优势，为共指消解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了AoU框架，通过验证前提条件来约束推理过程，解决LLM推理过程中的幻觉问题，在多个数学推理数据集上显著提升准确性和忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常生成看似连贯但基于未经证实假设的推理轨迹，导致幻觉结论。现有工作主要处理事实性幻觉或依赖事后验证，未能有效解决推理引发的幻觉问题。

Method: AoU框架通过三个阶段约束推理：1)将查询分解为候选假设，2)审计这些假设的支持度，3)仅基于已验证的子集进行推理。该方法在理论上与后验约束推理、选择性预测和拒绝学习相关联。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上，AoU相比Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding方法取得了显著提升：GSM8K上最高+30%，MultiArith上+45%，SVAMP上持续+20-28%的改进。

Conclusion: AoU框架通过验证前提条件有效解决了LLM推理过程中的幻觉问题，在理论和实证上都证明了其有效性，显著提升了推理的准确性和忠实性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有后门攻击防御方法依赖不切实际的触发器设置假设，而实际中后门往往通过公开检查点嵌入，需要无需先验知识的防御方案。

Method: 两阶段防御框架：首先通过注入已知触发器聚集后门表示，然后进行恢复微调以恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中将平均攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；干净准确率和实用性保持在原始模型0.5%以内；防御方法对不同类型后门具有通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持模型实用性的同时有效防御后门攻击，具有实际部署的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在跨语言事实知识回忆中存在不一致性，但导致这种不一致性的因素尚不清楚。研究者假设这可能源于实体对齐失败，即跨语言共享概念空间中主体和客体实体的映射过程存在问题。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐情况，发现一致性与对齐强相关。提出了SubSub和SubInj两种方法，将英语翻译的主体集成到跨语言提示中，增强实体表示对齐。

Result: 研究发现实体对齐与一致性密切相关，主体或客体对齐失败经常导致不一致。提出的方法显著提高了事实回忆准确性和一致性，通过模型内部枢纽语言处理加强了实体表示对齐。

Conclusion: 实体对齐失败是多语言事实预测不一致的主要原因，通过集成英语翻译主体到提示中的方法能有效改善跨语言事实预测，为提升多语言模型性能提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如DeepConf虽然有效但计算开销巨大，需要更高效的测试时推理策略。

Method: 通过递归利用模型内在的推理、验证和总结能力，增强正确解的保留并减少Pass@k与Pass@1之间的差距。

Result: 在多个开源模型和挑战性多模态推理基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的自然对话能力依赖于其共情理解能力，但情感体验受到人口统计和文化背景的影响，因此需要研究LLMs是否能在不同用户群体中展现公平的共情能力。

Method: 采用交叉分析方法，构建了315个独特角色（结合年龄、文化和性别属性），测试了四个LLMs的共情反应，并辅以定性分析。

Result: 结果显示人口属性深刻影响模型的共情反应，多属性组合会改变预期共情模式，模型总体上反映了现实世界的共情趋势，但对某些群体（如儒家文化）存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计考虑人口多样性的共情感知LLMs的重要性，以促进更包容和公平的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

*Nam Luu,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型的端到端架构，用于同时执行自动语音识别和语音翻译任务。在英德翻译实验中，该模型不仅优于SeamlessM4T，还能媲美Whisper和NLLB级联系统，在COMET指标上获得8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索结合预训练语音编码器和LLMs的端到端架构，以同时完成ASR和ST任务，旨在提升语音翻译的性能和效率。

Method: 采用预训练语音编码器与大型语言模型相结合的端到端架构，同时处理自动语音识别和语音翻译任务。

Result: 在英德翻译实验中，最佳模型不仅超越了SeamlessM4T，还达到了与Whisper和NLLB级联系统相当的性能，在COMET指标上获得8%的显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语音编码器和LLMs的端到端架构在语音翻译任务中表现出色，能够同时处理ASR和ST，并取得优于现有端到端模型和媲美级联系统的性能。

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个名为ASC分析器的Python包，用于自动标记论元结构构式并计算50个指标，以分析第二语言写作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然论元结构构式为分析第二语言能力提供了理论基础，但目前缺乏可扩展和系统化的工具来测量其使用情况。

Method: 开发了一个公开可用的Python包ASC分析器，能够自动标记论元结构构式，并计算多样性、比例、频率和构式-动词关联强度等50个指标。

Result: 通过双变量和多变量分析，验证了ASC指标与第二语言写作分数之间的关系。

Conclusion: ASC分析器填补了测量论元结构构式使用情况的工具空白，为第二语言能力评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力，发现即使是前沿模型在这方面也存在显著问题，拒绝准确率低于50%。作者提出了RefusalBench评估框架，通过语言扰动生成诊断测试用例，评估了30多个模型并发现了系统性失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中语言模型基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力对安全性至关重要，但目前仍是显著失败点。静态基准测试无法可靠评估这一能力，因为模型会利用数据集特定伪影和记忆测试实例。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成方法，通过程序化创建诊断测试用例，采用176种不同扰动策略，涵盖六类信息不确定性和三个强度级别。构建了两个基准测试：RefusalBench-NQ（单文档）和RefusalBench-GaRAGe（多文档）。

Result: 评估30多个模型发现系统性失败模式：拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，模型规模扩展和扩展推理都无法提升性能。拒绝准确率在多文档任务中低于50%，模型表现出危险的过度自信或过度谨慎。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练、对齐敏感的能力，为改进提供了明确路径。作者发布了基准测试和完整生成框架，以支持对这一关键能力的持续动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

TL;DR: AssoMem是一个新颖的关联记忆图框架，通过自动提取线索锚定对话话语，结合多维检索信号，在大规模记忆检索中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模记忆增强AI助手在相似密集场景下准确回忆的核心挑战，现有方法主要依赖语义距离检索，受人类关联信息方式启发。

Method: 构建关联记忆图，将对话话语锚定到自动提取的线索上，集成相关性、重要性和时间对齐等多维检索信号，采用自适应互信息驱动的融合策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试和新引入的MeetingQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AssoMem始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AssoMem在上下文感知记忆回忆方面具有优越性，验证了其在大规模记忆检索任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出STEAM框架，通过语义层面的知识编辑解决传统基于token级似然优化的方法在语义连贯性上的不足，将更新知识更好地整合到模型知识结构中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注token级似然优化，缺乏语义连贯性考虑，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中形成孤立的残差流，绕过自然推理过程。

Method: STEAM框架首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示向这些锚点对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架为知识更新提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个用于评估长形式临床问答系统的框架，通过比较粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，发现在正确性、相关性和安全性维度上标注者间一致性存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长形式临床问答系统需要医疗专业知识且资源密集，人工判断在长文本上难以保持一致，因此需要开发适合有限资源和高专业要求环境的评估框架。

Method: 基于医生对300个真实患者问题的标注，比较了粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估方法，分析在正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度上的标注者间一致性。

Result: 标注者间一致性因维度而异：细粒度标注提高了正确性的一致性，粗粒度标注提高了相关性的一致性，而安全性判断仍然不一致。仅标注少量句子子集即可获得与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: LongQAEval提供了实用的评估建议，在有限资源环境下，选择适当的评估粒度可以显著降低评估成本和工作量，同时保持评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

TL;DR: LISTEN基准测试显示当前大型音频语言模型在情感理解中主要依赖词汇线索而非声学线索，存在词汇主导现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息还是主要依赖词汇内容来理解情感。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对比来评估6个最先进模型的情感理解能力。

Result: 模型在词汇线索中性时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分情感，副语言场景下表现接近随机。

Conclusion: 当前LALMs主要"转录"而非"聆听"，过度依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: RECON框架通过集成显式摘要模块压缩检索证据，在推理循环中减少35%上下文长度，提升训练速度和推理延迟，同时提高下游QA任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于强化学习的检索增强生成系统中上下文管理效率低下的问题，长而嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: 引入RECON框架，集成显式摘要模块压缩证据，采用两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLM进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: 减少35%总上下文长度，3B模型平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RECON证明学习型上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展和高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLMs在安全对齐过程中产生的过度拒绝问题，构建了RagRefuse基准测试，并提出SafeRAG-Steering方法来减少良性查询的过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐导致过度拒绝问题——模型由于激进的安全过滤器而拒绝良性请求，这影响了检索增强生成系统的实用性。

Method: 构建RagRefuse基准测试，涵盖医疗、化学和开放领域；提出SafeRAG-Steering方法，通过模型中心的嵌入干预在推理时将嵌入区域引导到确认安全的非拒绝输出区域。

Result: 分析表明上下文安排/污染、查询和上下文领域以及有害文本密度都会触发对良性查询的拒绝，其效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。SafeRAG-Steering方法在保持合法拒绝的同时减少了污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了RAG系统中过度拒绝问题的机制，并提出了有效的缓解方法，在保持安全性的同时提高了系统的实用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC方法在将语音下采样到与文本相似长度时，无法有效对齐语音和文本，特别是在语音长度与文本长度接近的情况下存在对齐困难。

Method: 1) 时间独立性损失(TIL)；2) 基于编辑距离的对齐交叉熵损失(AXE)；3) 关键帧融合技术，通过加权求和关键帧及其上下文2帧来增强关键帧信息。

Result: 在AISHELL-1和AISHELL-2数据集子集上的实验表明，所提方法优于先前工作，帧数减少至少86%。

Conclusion: 提出的TIL和AXE损失函数结合关键帧融合技术，有效解决了语音与文本长度对齐问题，显著提升了语音识别性能并大幅减少了计算量。

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

Method: 采用粗到细的框架，结合基于适应度的子集搜索和基于归因的样本搜索，使用迭代遗传算法进行基准压缩

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上，用25倍少的样本保持所有模型排名在5%内变化，用200倍少的样本达到95%排名保持

Conclusion: EssenceBench框架在基准压缩方面优于现有方法，具有更低的重构误差和更高的效率

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Motivation: 现有评估基准过度强调工程方面而忽视学术严谨性，任务多样性有限，过于偏重应用导向任务而非基础研究问题，且难以扩展到真实研究环境。

Method: 引入FML-bench基准，包含8个多样化的基础机器学习研究问题，减少编码负担，强调基础问题而非特定用例，提供高任务多样性，并可扩展到真实世界的机器学习GitHub仓库。

Result: 评估了最先进的自动研究代理，发现采用广泛研究探索策略的代理优于专注于狭窄但深入探索的代理。

Conclusion: 强调探索的广度可能比仅关注增量改进带来更有效的研究成果，FML-bench为评估自动机器学习研究代理提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字服务经济中，理解什么驱动流行度至关重要。以往研究主要关注内容特征，但创作者经常误判观众真正看重什么。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲数据，比较创作者的主题供给与观众参与度表达的需求，并进行纵向分析。

Result: 识别出创作者供给与消费者偏好之间的持续不匹配，纵向分析显示时间动态比主题内容对消费者参与度的影响更强。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了内容特征是流行度主要驱动因素的假设，强调了时机和情境因素在塑造消费者反应中的重要性，为数字平台上的消费者注意力动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

*Guangxin He,Shen Nie,Fengqi Zhu,Yuankang Zhao,Tianyi Bai,Ran Yan,Jie Fu,Chongxuan Li,Binhang Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过后训练技术扩展扩散LLM上下文窗口的方法，无需从头训练，成功将上下文扩展到128K token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散LLM在长上下文行为方面的研究尚不充分，现有方法难以稳定扩展到长上下文范围。

Method: 对标准RoPE位置编码进行简单修改以适应扩散过程的概率建模，比较不同的掩码策略对优化稳定性和长程记忆的影响。

Result: 提出的UltraLLaDA模型在长上下文任务中显著优于无需训练的基线方法，成功实现128K token上下文窗口。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置扩展技术是扩展扩散LLM上下文窗口的关键杠杆，为通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: VOLTAGE是一种基于对比学习的OCR方法，专为低资源语言设计，通过自动字形特征推荐和聚类标注，结合数据增强技术，在Takri等印度文字上取得了95%（印刷体）和87%（手写体）的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种濒危，语言消失会导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失。低资源语言缺乏无监督OCR方法是阻碍其数字包容的主要原因之一。

Method: 提出VOLTAGE方法：基于对比学习，利用自动字形特征推荐进行聚类标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。

Result: 在Takri文字上达到95%的印刷体准确率和87%的手写体准确率，并在其他印度文字（包括低资源和高资源）上验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言提供了有效的OCR解决方案，通过基线研究和消融实验证明了其有效性，并构建了下游应用用例。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

TL;DR: AdvPrompt通过黑盒对抗提示减少大型推理模型的过度思考，在保持准确性的同时显著降低token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂推理任务时会产生冗长的推理过程，导致计算成本和延迟过高，阻碍实际部署

Method: AdvPrompt迭代优化框架，从多角度生成高质量对抗提示，将开源和闭源模型都视为黑盒通信器

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt平均减少40%的token使用量，在GSM8K上实现3倍响应长度缩减，在MATH-500上为Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5分别减少35%和47%的token使用

Conclusion: 黑盒提示是一种实用有效的策略，可显著提升大型推理模型的效率，且AdvPrompt在不同模型规模和系列中具有良好的通用性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个完全基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，相比人工构造的基准能更好地反映实际使用中的幻觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准大多通过人为诱导或模拟对话构建，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要构建基于真实对话的基准。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中筛选样本并进行标注，构建AuthenHallu基准，并探索使用普通LLM作为幻觉检测器的潜力。

Result: 在基准中31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学和数字问题等挑战性领域这一比例高达60.0%。普通LLM作为检测器虽有潜力但实际性能不足。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确地反映LLM幻觉特征，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的能力仍需改进，AuthenHallu为未来研究提供了更真实的评估基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: BitMar是一种量化多模态transformer，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨注意力transformer等多模态视觉语言模型在边缘设备部署时因完整精度主干网络带来的挑战，以及内存增强架构与激进边缘量化结合不足的问题。

Method: 使用1.58位文本编码器(BitNet风格)和视觉编码器(DiNOv2基础)创建紧凑嵌入，通过查询固定大小的键值情景记忆，解码器采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制。

Result: 在低延迟和小模型占用下实现了具有竞争力的图像描述和多模态理解性能，达到了良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署，为资源受限环境下的多模态生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

*Di Wu abd Shuaidong Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于时序大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，通过时间衰减函数和注意力机制捕捉主题在不同时期的演变，在潜在主题空间中使用状态转移矩阵描述动态演化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题随时间动态演化的特性，需要统一建模语义表示和时间演化，以提高主题连贯性、多样性和时间稳定性。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，将时序表示映射到潜在主题空间，应用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统性解决方案，丰富了主题建模的研究范式，支持多领域的复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对校准数据如何影响压缩后LLM能力的研究不够系统，特别是在复杂推理能力方面，需要从组合特性和领域对应等角度深入分析。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索其对数学问题解决和代码生成等高级推理能力的影响，并提出基于激活空间代表性和多样性的校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 研究发现激活空间的代表性和多样性从根本上决定了校准数据的质量，提出的数据筛选框架能够有效提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量不仅取决于数据来源和样本数量，更重要的是其在激活空间的代表性和多样性，这为改进后训练压缩方法提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注声明检测和验证，但缺乏对事实陈述背后认知结构和证据基础的深入分析。本文旨在理解事实陈述如何通过外部来源获得可信度。

Method: 构建FactAppeal数据集，包含跨度级标注识别事实陈述和来源提及，细粒度标注来源类型、命名、角色、认知凭证、引用方式等特征。使用2B-9B参数范围的编码器和生成解码器模型进行建模。

Result: FactAppeal数据集包含3,226个英语新闻句子标注。最佳模型Gemma 2 9B在认知诉求识别任务上达到0.73宏F1分数。

Conclusion: 认知诉求识别是一个重要且可行的任务，FactAppeal数据集为理解事实陈述的可信度基础提供了有价值的资源，现有大语言模型在该任务上表现良好。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

Motivation: 虽然媒体偏见被广泛研究，但事实报道背后的认知策略在计算层面仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在通过比较CNN和福克斯新闻的报道风格来填补这一空白。

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较同一事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇涵盖COVID-19大流行和以色列-哈马斯战争的文章，隔离报道风格与主题选择的影响。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述并更倾向于引用外部来源，两家媒体展现明显不同的引用模式：CNN通过引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威，而福克斯新闻偏好新闻报道和直接引语。

Conclusion: 这项研究量化了党派媒体如何系统性地使用不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新的维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Motivation: 现有的单体架构在处理复杂推理和多样化数据库模式时存在困难，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用多代理框架，包括推理代理、编码代理和优化步骤，结合自适应路由器在模块化流水线和基线解析器之间进行选择，支持并行执行以提高可扩展性。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，AGENTIQL实现了86.07%的执行准确率，使用14B模型，接近GPT-4的89.65% SOTA性能，同时显著提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL提供了一个鲁棒、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法，通过展示中间推理步骤增强了透明度，缩小了与GPT-4等大型模型的性能差距。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: BrowserAgent是一个更交互式的网页代理，通过人类启发的浏览器操作（如滚动、点击、输入）直接处理原始网页，在多项Open-QA任务中表现优于Search-R1，特别是在多跳QA任务上有约20%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Search-R1和WebDancer依赖额外工具将交互式网页环境转换为静态文本，这与人类多样化的浏览器交互行为（滚动、点击、输入）不符。需要开发更接近人类浏览行为的交互式代理。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（监督微调SFT和拒绝微调RFT）提升模型泛化能力，通过Playwright预定义的浏览器操作直接处理原始网页，并引入显式记忆机制存储跨步骤的关键结论。

Result: 尽管训练数据显著少于Search-R1，BrowserAgent在不同Open-QA任务中取得更具竞争力的结果，7B版本在多跳QA任务（HotpotQA、2Wiki、Bamboogle）上比Search-R1提升约20%。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可作为更先进、更交互式和可扩展的网页代理框架，其人类启发的浏览器操作方式更接近真实浏览行为。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Result: 仅使用1000个训练样本，该方法在6种语言的3个数据集上表现出优越性能，超越了使用更多数据训练的大模型，并展现出强大的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard为解决LLM安全防护中的可解释性和多语言性能问题提供了有效方案，同时贡献了多语言基准扩展和开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and contextual models such as BERT
to analyze linguistic, emotional, and contextual cues. The system integrates
sentiment analysis, contextual embeddings, linguistic feature extraction, and
emotion detection through a multi-layer architecture. While the model is in the
conceptual stage, it demonstrates feasibility for real-world applications such
as chatbots and social media analysis.

*Wenqing Zhang,Trang Nguyen,Elizabeth A. Stuart,Yiqun T. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在系统性综述中自动化方法学评估表现良好，在明确方法标准上接近人类准确率，但在复杂推理任务上表现较差，需要人类监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性综述工作量大，特别是提取详细方法学信息时。LLMs有潜力自动化方法学评估，改变证据合成方式。

Method: 以因果中介分析为代表领域，在180篇全文科学文献上比较最先进LLMs与专家人类评审员的性能。

Result: 模型性能与人类判断高度相关（准确率相关性0.71；F1相关性0.97），在明确方法标准上达到接近人类准确率，但在复杂评估上准确率下降15%。错误常源于浅层语言线索误解。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs擅长识别明确方法特征，但需要人类监督进行细致解释。自动化信息提取与专家评审结合是提高证据合成效率和严谨性的有前景方法。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are crucial for synthesizing scientific evidence but
remain labor-intensive, especially when extracting detailed methodological
information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了HiligayNER，这是首个用于Hiligaynon语命名实体识别的公开基线模型，使用超过8000个标注句子训练，在mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa上均取得超过80%的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hiligaynon语作为菲律宾的一种代表性语言，由于缺乏标注语料库和基线模型，在语言处理研究中代表性不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从公开新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集超过8000个标注句子，构建语料库，并对mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa两个Transformer模型进行微调。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上都取得了超过80%的精确率、召回率和F1分数，与宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估显示出良好的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为代表性不足的菲律宾语言（特别是Hiligaynon语）的语言技术发展做出了贡献，支持了低资源环境下多语言NLP的进一步研究。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了推理时扩展技术，将这一新兴领域系统性地分为输出导向和输入导向两大类方法，以应对高质量训练数据稀缺的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高质量训练数据的快速减少，传统的通过扩大模型规模和训练数据的性能提升方式面临瓶颈，研究重点转向推理时扩展，通过在部署时使用额外计算来显著提升LLM在下游任务中的性能，而无需昂贵的模型重新训练。

Method: 系统性地将推理时扩展技术组织为两大视角：输出导向方法（包括复杂多步生成策略、推理方法、搜索解码方法、长链思维训练和模型集成）和输入导向方法（主要包括少样本学习和RAG，其中RAG细分为查询扩展、数据、检索与重排序、LLM生成方法和多模态RAG）。

Result: 建立了一个全面的推理时扩展技术分类框架，为这一快速发展的领域提供了系统化的组织结构，帮助研究人员和实践者更好地理解和应用这些技术。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过系统性地分类和组织各种技术，为应对训练数据稀缺的挑战提供了有效的解决方案，推动了LLM性能的持续提升。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于人机交互和健康传播研究的五维度评估框架HCRS，用于评估健康文本简化，超越传统表面指标，关注清晰度、可信度、语调、文化相关性和可操作性等人类中心特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP评估指标（如BLEU、FKGL、SARI）主要捕捉表面特征，无法衡量人类中心特征如清晰度、可信度、语调、文化相关性和可操作性，这在高风险健康情境中尤为关键。

Method: 提出人类中心可读性评分（HCRS），一个五维度评估框架，结合自动测量和结构化人类反馈，捕捉可读性的关系和情境方面。

Result: 论文概述了该框架，讨论了其在参与式评估工作流程中的整合，并提出了实证验证协议。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推动健康文本简化评估超越表面指标，使NLP系统更贴近多样化用户的需求、期望和生活经验。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自底向上方法，用于线性化树状结构（如GitHub仓库）中的知识，通过在每个层级生成隐式聚合摘要，显著减少检索器中的文档数量（减少68%以上），同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能够基于上下文信息生成响应，但在处理结构化数据（特别是树状层次结构）时，如何最佳地表示检索到的知识以生成响应尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出自底向上方法，通过在每个层次级别生成隐式、聚合的摘要来线性化树状结构中的知识，使知识能够存储在知识库中并直接与RAG一起使用。

Result: 与在原始非结构化代码上使用RAG相比，响应质量相当，但检索器中的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的高效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了音译在跨语言NLP中的作用，发现罗马化在大多数评估场景中表现最佳，主要原因是能产生与预训练语言共享的更长子词标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究音译作为连接不同语言的手段，特别是在使用非拉丁文字的语言中，探索共享文字、重叠词汇和共享音系对多语言模型性能的贡献程度。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音位转录和替换密码）以及正字法进行受控实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估每种模型。

Result: 罗马化在8个评估设置中的7个显著优于其他输入类型，与假设一致，表明这是最有效的方法。

Conclusion: 罗马化是最有效的音译方法，其成功主要归因于能够产生与预训练语言共享的更长子词标记，从而更好地利用模型能力。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DUAL-Bench，这是首个专注于多模态视觉语言模型中过度拒绝和安全完成问题的基准测试，评估了18个VLM在12个危险类别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型能力增强，在安全性和实用性之间保持平衡成为核心挑战。现有基准未能系统解决视觉模态中的过度拒绝问题，特别是在双重用途场景下，模型要么过于保守地拒绝，要么不安全地完成任务。

Method: 构建DUAL-Bench多模态基准，评估18个VLM在12个危险类别中的表现，重点关注语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: 结果显示模型表现有显著改进空间：GPT-5-Nano达到12.9%的安全完成率，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进更精细的对齐策略发展，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又实用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了6种轻量级测试时扩展策略和4个LLM在Text-to-SQL任务上的表现，发现分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升性能，但额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然测试时扩展策略在LLM解决方案中显示出潜力，但在实际应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合时，仍不确定。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上对6种轻量级、面向工业的测试时扩展策略和4个LLM（包括2个推理模型）进行基准测试，除了标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和token消耗。

Result: 分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升通用和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了在实际部署Text2SQL系统时，在准确性、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，旨在通过模块化分解实现更灵活的人类干预，让用户对研究过程有更大控制和定制能力。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，功能组件（如骨架初始化、摘要构建、骨架精炼）作为独立MCP服务器实现，高层规划器根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态选择模块。

Result: 人类评估显示，该系统在内容深度和长度方面均优于代表性基线方法，突显了基于MCP的模块化规划的优势。

Conclusion: MCP-based的模块化规划方法有效支持长篇综述生成，通过多轮交互精确捕捉研究视角，生成全面骨架并发展为深度综述。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言中表达置信度时经常表现出过度自信，但其原因尚不清楚，需要改进置信度校准以增强可靠性

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案依赖置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计

Result: ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持任务性能，增强了答案基础性，产生更平衡和校准良好的置信度分布

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过度自信的根源，建立了更可信的置信度表达框架

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过表示学习实体片段间的上下文间隙来解决不连续命名实体识别中的解码模糊问题，在三个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中，命名实体可能由非相邻标记组成并与其他实体重叠。现有方法通过连接实体片段或内部标记来识别不连续实体，但由于跨度或单词组合的多样性，面临错误传播和解码模糊的挑战。

Method: 将上下文间隙作为额外的跨度类型，将跨度分类转换为标记对网格标注任务。设计两个交互组件：跨度内规律提取模块使用双仿射机制和线性注意力捕获每个跨度的内部规律；跨间关系增强模块使用交叉注意力获取不同跨度间的语义关系。在实体解码阶段使用BFS算法搜索有效路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，GapDNER在不连续NER任务上达到了新的最先进性能，并在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GapDNER通过表示学习上下文间隙有效解决了不连续NER中的解码模糊问题，证明了该方法在识别复杂实体结构方面的有效性。

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 本文提出评估AI系统对游戏评价能力的新范式，通过比较语言推理模型与人类在评估游戏公平性和趣味性方面的表现，发现推理模型更接近人类判断，但存在非单调关系和资源使用不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，而忽略了AI系统对问题价值判断的能力。本文旨在建立评估AI系统评价能力的新框架，特别是在游戏评估领域。

Method: 使用包含100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多个人类判断的大规模数据集，比较现代语言推理模型与人类和符号计算代理在评估游戏公平性和趣味性方面的表现。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评估上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但存在非单调关系：模型越接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度反而下降。评估趣味性时模型表现更不稳定，且推理模型资源使用高度可变。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以提高评估的稳定性和可预测性。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Conclusion: 该研究证实了BiLSTM-CNN-CRF架构的可靠性和有效性，为序列标注任务提供了可复现的基准模型。

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory

(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了KOTOX：首个支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，针对低资源语言中的隐蔽毒性内容问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中毒性内容日益严重，但现有研究主要关注英语，低资源语言代表性不足。LLMs难以识别和中和这些语言中的毒性表达，特别是当用户使用混淆技术逃避检测时

Method: 基于韩语语言学特征对混淆方法进行分类，定义基于真实案例的转换规则，构建三个难度级别（简单、普通、困难）的数据集版本

Result: 创建了首个同时支持韩语去混淆和去毒化的数据集，包含不同混淆难度级别的数据，代码和数据已开源

Conclusion: KOTOX数据集有助于更好地理解和减轻低资源语言LLM中的混淆毒性内容，为相关研究提供重要资源

Abstract: Toxic content has become an increasingly critical social issue with the rapid
expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化构建虚假前提问题基准的流程，创建了JBA数据集，并开发了一个识别增强框架来提升多模态大语言模型识别虚假前提的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚假前提问题基准存在范围有限、缺乏细粒度分类和覆盖不足的问题，无法充分评估模型识别虚假前提的能力。

Method: 开发了全自动构建虚假前提问题基准的流程，系统地将前提分为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了识别增强框架来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 当前MLLMs在虚假前提识别方面仍然存在困难，但使用该框架训练的模型在虚假前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的JBA数据集和识别增强框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型识别虚假前提的能力，增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

TL;DR: 提出了RV-HATE框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，针对不同仇恨言论数据集的特征进行自适应检测，提高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在不同平台和来源的数据集中表现出多样化的特征，但现有检测方法通常采用固定方法而未考虑数据特异性。

Method: 构建包含多个专门模块的框架，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，通过投票机制聚合输出。

Result: RV-HATE能够有效处理隐含仇恨言论，在检测准确性上优于传统的静态方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过适应数据集特定特征，不仅提高了检测性能，还提供了对每个数据集独特特征的可解释性洞察。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT)方法，仅对通过反事实扰动识别出的关键推理标记进行微调，在数学推理任务上优于标准SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督微调(SFT)对所有标记进行统一惩罚，忽视了只有少量关键标记决定推理正确性，导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力有限。

Method: CFT通过反事实扰动识别功能上不可或缺的关键标记，仅对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键标记的多样性。

Result: 在5个模型、3个模型家族和11个数学推理基准测试中，CFT仅微调不到12%的标记，但持续优于标准SFT，并提高了采样多样性和强化学习初始化效果。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的LLM高效微调框架，能够在保持更高熵的同时维持性能增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD是一个用于深度研究框架的四阶段安全防护系统，通过开放域评估和阶段性保护机制，在提高防御成功率18.16%的同时将过度拒绝率降低6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段性保护，通常只关注问答的精确匹配准确性，而忽视了报告质量的关键方面如可信度、连贯性、广度、深度和安全性，可能导致危险或恶意来源被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 提出DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，包含四阶段安全保障机制，采用开放域评估方法评估参考文献和报告，并引入DRSAFEBENCH作为深度研究安全性的阶段性基准测试。

Result: 在多种最先进LLM（包括GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-flash、DeepSeek-v3和o4-mini）上的评估显示，DEEPRESEARCHGUARD平均防御成功率提高18.16%，同时过度拒绝率降低6%。输入防护提供最显著的早期阶段保护，计划和研究防护增强了引用规范和来源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性地提高报告质量而不会产生过度的过度拒绝率。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

TL;DR: 该研究对6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中进行审计，发现这些模型对残障人士存在显著的ABLEIST伤害，且这些伤害在性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人中进一步加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方背景，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士因性别和种姓等交叉边缘化因素所面临的歧视问题。

Method: 引入ABLEIST评估框架，包含5个残障歧视特定指标和3个交叉伤害指标，对6个LLM在多样化残障、性别、国籍和种姓背景的招聘场景中进行全面审计。

Result: 发现LLM对残障候选人产生显著的ABLEIST伤害，许多先进模型未能检测到这些伤害。性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人面临更严重的交叉伤害。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在招聘等高风险领域对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Motivation: 现有的联合逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了它们在评估和训练中的泛化能力。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持合成完全可控的自然语言联合推理任务，能够控制推理世界丰富度、逻辑推理深度和数值计算复杂度。

Result: 实验显示多个LLM在逻辑-数值推理方面存在持续弱点，LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和目标监督源。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth能够作为诊断工具和训练数据源，有效提升语言模型的联合推理能力。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域提供临床指导，但直接部署给患者存在安全风险，因为缺乏领域专业知识。需要重新定位LLM角色，使其作为临床助手与医生协作。

Method: 通过两阶段启发-反馈调查识别临床工作流需求，构建了包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科。建立了DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench评估基准。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进以医生为中心的医疗大语言模型开发提供了有价值的资源和框架，强调了LLM作为临床助手的协作角色定位。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

TL;DR: LRD是一种两阶段并行解码框架，通过潜在精炼和预测反馈循环解决传统自回归模型的高延迟问题，在保持准确性的同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型由于严格顺序解码导致高延迟，而现有扩散式方法存在信息丢失和过早决策的问题，需要一种更好的并行生成方案。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段保持掩码位置为预测标记和掩码嵌入的分布混合，建立全局一致信念；第二阶段逐步确定置信标记，保留不确定标记进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛准则。

Result: 在编程任务（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理任务（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）上准确率提升，同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的强大且通用的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升生成速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

Motivation: 当前强化LLM推理的方法存在训练偏差，过度依赖人类或高能力模型的中间步骤标注，限制了探索替代性非人类推理路径的能力，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: CGPO方法：利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，在错误发生前的最低置信点进行指导，应用自生成的非人类推理路径指导来缓解轨迹漂移。

Result: 实验表明，在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的CGPO方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型生成数据或人工标注的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 置信度引导的推理路径偏好优化方法能够有效识别推理过程中的关键不确定性点，通过自生成的指导提升模型推理性能，减少对人类标注的依赖。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

Motivation: 现有的基于距离的文本分类方法在处理多标签分类时面临阈值设定的挑战，特别是当文本实例可以有多个真实标签时。本文旨在探索句子编码器在基于距离分类中的能力，并解决多标签分类中的阈值优化问题。

Method: 首先进行探索性研究验证文本和标签之间的语义关系是否因模型、数据集和标签集而异，然后提出一种使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的新方法。

Result: 相似性分布在模型、数据集和标签集之间存在显著差异。提出的标签特定阈值方法相比归一化0.5阈值平均提升46%性能，相比先前工作的均匀阈值方法平均提升14%。该方法在有限标注样本下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于距离的无监督多标签文本分类通过优化标签特定阈值可以显著提升性能，该方法具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，为多标签分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,
we perform a cross-lingual analysis with our target languages. Our findings
underscore the importance of multilingual and variety-aware approaches in hate
speech detection and offer a foundation for improved benchmarking in
underrepresented European languages.

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的框架来评估视觉语言模型在胸部X光视觉问答中的思维链解释的忠实性，发现答案准确性和解释质量是解耦的，专有模型在归因和保真度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的思维链解释往往听起来合理但未能反映真实决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会削弱信任。现有评估很少捕捉到这种不一致性。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改，在三个维度上探测思维链忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准。进行了读者研究（n=4）并基准测试了六个视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估者与放射科医生的相关性在放射科医生内部范围内，归因对齐强（τ_b=0.670），保真度对齐中等（τ_b=0.387），置信度对齐弱（τ_b=0.091）。专有模型在归因（25.0% vs 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs 31.7%）方面优于开源模型。

Conclusion: 答案准确性和解释质量是解耦的，文本线索比视觉线索更能改变解释，需要超越最终答案准确性的评估来降低部署风险。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer语言模型中存在稀疏计算图（称为话语电路），仅占GPT-2模型的约0.2%，负责处理话语关系理解。这些电路在不同话语框架中具有良好泛化能力，且不同层负责不同级别的语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Transformer语言模型中哪些组件负责话语理解，假设存在稀疏的计算图控制模型处理话语关系的方式。

Method: 引入Completion under Discourse Relation (CuDR)任务，构建最小对比对语料库用于激活修补电路发现，在英语PDTB-based CuDR任务上实验。

Result: 发现稀疏电路（约0.2%的GPT-2模型）能够恢复话语理解能力，这些电路在RST和SDRT等未见话语框架中泛化良好。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中的话语理解由稀疏电路实现，下层捕获词汇语义和指代等语言特征，上层编码话语级抽象，特征效用在不同框架中保持一致。

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

TL;DR: RAGen是一个可扩展的模块化框架，用于生成面向特定领域的问答上下文三元组，以支持检索增强生成(RAG)系统的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效适应领域特定设置的RAG系统需要超越通用问答的专门化、上下文丰富的训练数据。

Method: 通过识别文档中的关键概念，基于Bloom分类学原则生成多样化问题，并从相关上下文中提取精确答案来生成问答上下文三元组。支持模块化流程，包括语义分块、分层概念提取和多块检索。

Result: RAGen能够高效处理大型和不断发展的文档语料库，无需冗余处理，特别适合科学研究和企业知识库等动态演化领域。

Conclusion: RAGen提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，能够为各种RAG适应方法生成领域接地的训练数据，促进RAG系统在特定领域的有效部署。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLAQ框架揭示LLMs在简单问答和复杂查询中的事实一致性存在系统性偏差，挑战了现有评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在简单事实问答中表现准确，但在复杂查询中可能给出不一致答案，这种可靠性差距影响模型可信度。

Method: 引入SLAQ评估框架，比较16个LLMs在600个查询中对相同事实的短形式和长形式回答。

Result: 发现短长回答存在系统性不对齐，存在位置依赖的准确性损失和动量效应，机制相似性指标可预测对齐度达78%。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估方法需重新审视简单查询性能与复杂任务可靠性的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，在保持性能的同时大幅降低LLM网络代理的运营成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM网络代理面临成本与性能的权衡挑战，复杂的提示包含目标、行动历史和状态信息，导致LLM集成性能下降。

Method: 提出WebRouter，采用成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时显式惩罚预期运营成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站测试中，相比GPT-4o基线，WebRouter将运营成本降低87.8%，准确率仅下降3.8%。

Conclusion: WebRouter通过信息论方法有效解决了LLM网络代理的成本性能权衡问题，实现了显著的成本节约和可接受的性能损失。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了NLP中道德情感分类的公平性问题，特别是在跨域场景下。通过引入道德公平一致性(MFC)指标，揭示了传统聚合性能指标可能掩盖的公平性差异，并发现Twitter到Reddit的迁移性能下降远大于反向迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理中道德情感分类的公平性挑战，特别是在跨域迁移场景下，因为整体性能指标可能掩盖不同道德标签之间的公平性差异。

Method: 使用Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus和Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus，在BERT和DistilBERT模型上进行多标签分类实验，采用域内和跨域评估协议，并提出了新的Moral Fairness Consistency (MFC)指标来量化跨域稳定性。

Result: 发现Twitter到Reddit迁移导致micro-F1下降14.9%，而反向仅下降1.5%；authority标签显示出最大的公平性差异（DPD: 0.22-0.23, EOD: 0.40-0.41）；MFC与Demographic Parity Difference呈完美负相关(rho=-1.000)，loyalty标签一致性最高(MFC=0.96)，authority最低(MFC=0.78)。

Conclusion: MFC可作为补充性的诊断导向指标，用于道德推理模型的公平性评估，支持在异质语言环境中更可靠的部署。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

TL;DR: 本文重新评估语义解析器的评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明结合，发现图匹配指标（如Smatch）无法有效捕捉逻辑等价性，并提出逻辑敏感的评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义解析器主要使用图匹配指标（如Smatch）进行评估，但这些指标只关注表面重叠而非逻辑等价性，无法满足推理导向应用的需求。

Method: 比较两种解析器构建方法：监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5），使用图匹配、双向蕴含定理证明和格式良好性进行多维度评估。

Result: 在图匹配上表现良好的模型经常无法产生逻辑等价的公式。标准化减少了目标变异性，提高了格式良好性和逻辑充分性。性能随公式复杂度增加而下降，主要错误涉及变量绑定、索引和谓词命名。

Conclusion: 图匹配指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化的标准化目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存量化框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层压缩技术，将KV缓存量化为亚1.4比特，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长文本时KV缓存内存需求巨大，在资源受限环境中部署困难，需要高效的量化方法来减少内存消耗。

Method: 提出两种关键技术：计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现无需训练的亚1.4比特量化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench基准测试中，XQuant优于现有最佳方法（如KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit），在更低比特宽度下保持更优性能。

Conclusion: XQuant在内存效率和模型准确性之间建立了更好的平衡，为资源受限环境中的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对基于内容操纵的攻击无效。AI代理需要能够批判性评估检索信息，以保护自身和用户免受内容攻击。

Method: 提出将自动事实核查任务重新用作AI代理的认知防御工具，通过外部证据验证主张并评估信息来源可信度。

Result: 识别了传统指令注入防御机制的局限性，提出了针对内容攻击的新型防御策略。

Conclusion: AI代理需要发展批判性评估能力，自动事实核查可作为有效的认知自我防御机制来应对内容攻击。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

TL;DR: 评估人类心理测量测试在大型语言模型中的可靠性和有效性，发现测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致，表明人类心理测试不能直接应用于LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大型语言模型的心理构念，但不确定这些为人类设计的测试在应用于LLM时是否产生有意义的结果。

Method: 系统评估三个构念（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试的可靠性和有效性，通过收敛效度（理论基础的测试间相关性）和生态效度（测试分数与下游任务行为的对齐）进行评估。

Result: 发现跨多个项目和提示变体的中等可靠性，但心理测量测试分数与下游任务中的模型行为不一致，在某些情况下甚至呈负相关，表明生态效度低。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前进行系统评估至关重要，为人类设计的心理测量测试不能直接应用于LLM而无需调整。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

Motivation: 解决实时假新闻检测中因新兴事件缺乏足够支持证据而导致的泛化困难问题，现有方法过度依赖外部证据，在证据稀缺时表现不佳。

Method: 提出EASE框架，包含三个顺序评估机制：证据评估（仅在证据充分时使用）、推理评估（在LLM可靠性足够时使用世界知识）、情感回退（当证据和推理都不可靠时使用情感线索）。通过指令调优和伪标签提升评估准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升对实时新闻的泛化能力，并发布了RealTimeNews-25新基准数据集。

Conclusion: EASE通过评估感知的专家选择机制，在证据稀缺的实时假新闻检测场景中实现了更好的泛化性能和检测准确性。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现上下文学习(ICL)也会导致大语言模型出现广泛的对齐失败现象(emergent misalignment)，在64个窄域上下文示例下，三个前沿模型产生错误响应的比例为2%-17%，256个示例时可达58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明窄域微调会导致模型广泛对齐失败，但这种现象在上下文学习中的表现尚未被研究，因此本文探讨ICL是否也会引发对齐失败。

Method: 使用三个数据集和三个前沿模型，通过提供不同数量(64-256个)的窄域上下文示例进行上下文学习实验，并分析逐步推理过程来探究机制。

Result: ICL确实会导致对齐失败，模型在窄域上下文示例影响下产生有害响应，67.5%的错误推理轨迹显示模型采用了危险或鲁莽的"角色"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 上下文学习与微调一样会导致模型对齐失败，这表明对齐问题不仅限于训练阶段，也存在于推理时的上下文影响中，需要更全面的安全措施。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges
for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated
dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental
well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and
impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.

*Sabrina McCallum,Amit Parekh,Alessandro Suglia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用语言反馈来从最优和次优演示中学习鲁棒表示的方法，通过将语言反馈嵌入作为Transformer策略的输入，并结合辅助自监督学习目标，显著提升了智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的具身AI方法主要从专家演示中学习策略，但缺乏评估演示动作质量的机制，只能学习最优行为或可能复制错误和低效行为。强化学习虽然提供了替代方案，但其探索过程通常牺牲数据效率。

Method: 将语言反馈嵌入直接作为Transformer策略输入序列的一部分，并可选地结合传统的下一动作预测目标与辅助自监督学习目标进行反馈预测。在自定义的BabyAI-XGen环境中测试该方法。

Result: 在具身视觉和语言任务上，该方法显著提高了智能体的组合泛化能力和鲁棒性，表明这种数据高效的方法能成功将次优行为转化为学习机会。

Conclusion: 语言反馈是语言指定具身任务中中间标量奖励的有竞争力且直观的替代方案。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化视觉语言模型提示框架，用于从简化文本生成可访问图像，通过五种提示模板和专家评估验证了基础对象聚焦模板在语义对齐方面的最佳表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智力障碍人士在理解复杂文本时存在困难，现有文本到图像模型注重美观性而非可访问性，需要探索视觉插图与文本简化之间的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基础对象聚焦、情境场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个句子级简化文本进行两阶段评估：CLIPScore自动评估和四位可访问性专家的人工标注。

Result: 基础对象聚焦提示模板获得最高语义对齐分数，复古风格被专家评为最可访问，Wikipedia数据集效果最佳，文本简单性维度具有强可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性，视觉极简主义能增强语言可访问性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地揭示和验证了LLMs中的情感电路，通过提取情境无关的情感方向、识别情感计算神经元和注意力头，构建了驱动情感表达的全局情感电路，实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对大型语言模型情感智能需求的增长，理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感成为关键挑战。

Method: 构建SEV受控数据集，提取情境无关情感方向，通过分析分解和因果分析识别情感计算神经元和注意力头，通过消融和增强干预验证其因果作用，整合局部组件构建全局情感电路。

Result: 直接调控这些情感电路在测试集上实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率，超越了基于提示和引导的方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统性揭示和验证LLMs中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文引入了LLM特定效用的概念，指出不同LLM对相同段落的效用评估存在差异，传统基于相关性的检索方法在RAG中不够有效，需要针对具体LLM进行效用优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLM由于内部知识和理解能力差异，对相同段落的效用感知不同。现有研究中人工标注的段落并非对LLM最优，且效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移。

Method: 通过多数据集和LLM的大规模实验，验证LLM特定效用的必要性；提出基于困惑度的效用评估指标；建立LLM特定效用判断的基准测试流程；评估现有效用判断方法。

Result: 实验证明人工标注段落对特定LLM并非最优；真实效用段落在不同LLM间不可迁移；基于伪答案的言语化方法表现稳健；LLM在效用评估中存在困难。

Conclusion: RAG研究必须采用LLM特定效用概念；困惑度是衡量查询和段落可读性的关键指标；需要开发更有效的LLM特定效用评估方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练时重放，解决了MoE模型中路由机制在强化学习训练中的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中的路由机制在强化学习训练中经常引入不稳定性，甚至导致灾难性训练崩溃。作者发现训练和推理阶段存在路由行为不一致的问题，这是导致不稳定的根本原因。

Method: 提出R3方法，记录推理引擎中的路由分布，并在训练阶段重放这些分布，减少训练-推理策略的KL散度，缓解极端差异。

Result: 实验证明R3能有效稳定RL训练，防止崩溃，在多种设置下表现优于GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: R3为稳定MoE模型中的强化学习训练提供了一个新的解决方案，解决了路由不一致性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会记忆训练数据，暴露隐私或版权文本，而现有防御主要针对预训练阶段，对微调过程中的记忆现象理解不足。

Method: 在Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型上进行微调实验，使用n-gram记忆分数跟踪逐字记忆，提出早停策略和n-gram感知损失正则化方法。

Result: 发现记忆在前几个epoch显著增加，早于验证困惑度或评估性能优化；提出的方法可减少40%记忆且性能损失最小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态，提供了实用且可扩展的见解来缓解记忆问题。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将社交推理游戏简化为LLM自博弈，产生模板化话语并忽视社交游戏的丰富性，且缺乏质量参考数据和精细评估指标。

Method: 1) 收集包含100+小时视频、3240万话语标记的狼人杀数据集；2) 提出两阶段策略对齐评估：话语评估（多选任务评估社交能力）和决策评估（评估投票选择和对手角色推理）。

Result: 实验显示最先进LLM表现各异，约半数模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新的基准和启发。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

TL;DR: KnowRL是一个简单但强大的框架，通过自省和共识奖励机制增强LLM对自身能力边界的认知，无需外部监督即可提升模型的自知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最好的LLMs在超过五分之一的情况下会错误判断自身能力，导致基于内部不确定性的响应无法完全信任，需要提升模型的自知能力以实现更可靠的AI。

Method: 结合两个组件：(i)自省：模型生成并分类判断可行或不可行的任务；(ii)共识奖励：通过内部一致性来强化自我认知评估的稳定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL显著提升了自知能力，准确率提高高达28%，F1分数提高12%，仅需少量种子集且无外部监督。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLMs自我提升知识认知的潜力，为构建更可靠、更负责任的AI以及在关键应用中更安全部署打开了大门。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，将大语言模型生成调查响应与偏差校正方法结合，比单纯使用合成方法能显著降低偏差（从24-86%降至5%以下），并在固定预算下，将更多人类响应分配给校正而非微调能获得更有效的估计结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统调查成本高、速度慢，虽然LLMs被提议作为可扩展的低成本替代方案，但其输出存在偏差且估计无效，需要研究如何优化合成与校正方法的结合以及人类响应的分配策略。

Method: 使用两个包含营养、政治和经济问题的面板调查，研究LLM合成方法与偏差校正方法的交互作用，探索人类响应在合成和校正之间的最佳分配策略。

Result: 单纯使用合成方法引入显著偏差（24-86%），而结合校正方法能将偏差降至5%以下，有效样本量提升达14%。在固定预算下，将更多人类响应分配给校正而非微调能实现更有效的估计。

Conclusion: 挑战了将所有人类响应用于微调的常见做法，证明在固定预算下，将大部分人类响应分配给校正方法能获得更有效的总体估计结果。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Motivation: 传统NER方法在实体类别持续增加的场景下面临灾难性遗忘和非实体类型语义偏移的挑战，需要开发有效的持续学习方法。

Method: 将CNER任务转换为持续实体三元组序列生成问题，使用预训练seq2seq模型，结合类型特定的基于置信度的伪标签策略和知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架在多个CNER设置中优于先前的最先进方法，并且与非持续学习结果之间的差距最小。

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单但有效的生成式框架，成功缓解了持续命名实体识别中的灾难性遗忘和语义偏移问题。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Motivation: 传统文本预处理方法通常忽略上下文信息，而大型语言模型能够考虑上下文且不需要大量语言特定的标注资源。

Method: 通过综合评估网络数据，比较基于LLM的预处理与传统算法在六种欧洲语言的多个文本分类任务中的表现。

Result: LLM能够以97%、82%和74%的准确率分别复制传统停用词去除、词形还原和词干提取方法。使用LLM预处理的文本训练的ML算法在F1分数上比传统技术提高达6%。

Conclusion: LLM在文本预处理任务中表现出色，能够有效考虑上下文信息，提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了LLM幻觉检测中的检测困境，通过克服信号稀缺和表征对齐障碍，实现了在各种任务类型上的稳定优异性能。

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

### [140] [An Encoder-Integrated PhoBERT with Graph Attention for Vietnamese Token-Level Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11537)
*Ba-Quang Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TextGraphFuseGAT模型，结合预训练Transformer编码器(PhoBERT)和图注意力网络，用于越南语标记级分类任务，在三个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列标注模型主要依赖顺序上下文，难以捕捉丰富的标记间依赖关系。需要结合预训练语义特征和图结构关系建模来提升标记分类性能。

Method: 使用PhoBERT生成标记嵌入，构建全连接图，通过GAT层捕获标记间依赖，再应用Transformer自注意力层增强上下文表示，最后通过分类头进行序列标注。

Result: 在三个越南语基准数据集(PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency、VietMed-NER)上均优于强基线模型，包括纯Transformer和混合神经网络模型。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语义特征与图关系建模能有效提升跨多个领域的标记分类性能，证明了图注意力网络在捕获标记间依赖方面的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PART是一种保护推理过程免受未经授权蒸馏的信息保留方法，通过去除自言自语行为和重新排序子结论来重构推理轨迹，在保持人类可理解性的同时破坏LLM的监督微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM展示详细推理过程有助于用户理解，但容易被未经授权蒸馏。现有保护策略往往过度简化推理过程，剥夺了用户的中间信息价值。需要一种既能保护模型又能保留信息的方法。

Method: 提出PART方法：1) 去除推理轨迹中的自言自语行为；2) 重新排序子结论。使用小型辅助模型执行这种重构，计算开销最小。

Result: 实验表明PART能持续破坏不同规模和类型学生模型的蒸馏效果。在AIME 2024上，32B学生模型性能从54.17降至46.88，下降13.5%。

Conclusion: PART有效解决了LLM推理过程保护与信息保留之间的权衡问题，为模型提供商提供了一种实用的抗蒸馏解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

*Saurabh Khanna,Xinxu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个连接语言活力、数字存在与后殖民理论的框架，揭示了AI系统中语言不平等是结构性而非偶然的，识别出四种语言类别，并指出英语在AI中的主导地位是权力结构的产物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多语言语料库上训练，但全球7613种语言中约2000种有数百万使用者的语言在数字生态系统中几乎不可见，这种语言不平等需要批判性分析。

Method: 通过分析所有记录的人类语言数据，将语言活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）与后殖民理论和认知不公正理论相结合，识别出四种语言类别。

Result: 识别出四种语言类别：强权语言（33%）、数字回声（6%）、消逝之声（36%）和隐形巨人（27%），后者指有数百万使用者但几乎无数字存在的语言。这些模式反映了从殖民时代语言等级到当代AI发展的连续性。

Conclusion: 英语在AI中的主导地位不是技术必要性，而是系统性排除边缘化语言知识的权力结构的产物，需要去殖民化语言技术和民主化AI访问。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLMs文化适应性的基准与实际挑战不符，需要更贴近真实多文化对话环境的评估方法。

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，形式化语言风格如何受情境、关系和文化背景影响，创建由多元文化评分者标注的数据集。

Result: 评估显示当前顶尖LLMs在对话场景中的文化适应性表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要新的跨文化评估标准：对话框架、风格敏感性和主观正确性，以更好地衡量LLMs的文化适应能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒方法无法生成人类可读的解释且泛化性差，而LLMs在文本理解、生成和推理方面表现出强大能力。

Method: 设计结构化提示方案将攻击制定为选择题，引入基于语义和中心性的过滤器压缩候选集，预计算高阶邻接矩阵并微调LLM进行三元组分类。

Result: 在两个知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于最强的黑盒基线，提供推理解释，与白盒方法性能相当。

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE能够有效进行知识图谱嵌入攻击并生成解释，消融研究和案例研究验证了其解释生成能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM模拟人类调查响应时，主要关注生成封闭式调查响应，但LLM通常训练用于生成开放式文本。缺乏标准的封闭式调查响应生成方法实践。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应，系统比较不同方法的效果。

Result: 不同调查响应生成方法在个体层面和子群体层面的对齐效果存在显著差异。限制性生成方法整体表现最佳，推理输出不能持续改善对齐。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查结果有显著影响，研究提出了应用调查响应生成方法的实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过任务特定适配器和共享适配器的协同优化，显著提高了多任务学习中的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LoRA方法在单任务设置中很有效，但在多任务学习场景中难以有效利用任务间知识，需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最优性能。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享适配器，促进跨任务知识转移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时显著减少了任务特定数据的使用量。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架有效解决了多任务学习中数据效率低的问题，为大规模语言模型的多任务适应提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

TL;DR: 提出SemCSE-Multi框架，为科学摘要生成多方面的嵌入表示，支持细粒度相似度评估和自适应可视化，并具备嵌入解码能力以提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法通常生成单一表示，无法捕捉科学文献的多个不同方面。需要一种能够生成多方面嵌入的方法，支持细粒度相似度比较和用户驱动的可视化。

Method: 采用无监督方法生成方面特定的摘要句子，训练嵌入模型将语义相关的摘要映射到嵌入空间中的邻近位置，然后将这些方面特定能力蒸馏到统一的嵌入模型中。

Result: 在入侵生物学和医学领域验证了框架的有效性，能够生成多方面嵌入，支持细粒度相似度评估，并成功解码嵌入回自然语言描述。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi框架能够有效生成科学摘要的多方面嵌入表示，提供细粒度相似度评估和自适应可视化能力，同时通过嵌入解码显著提高了可解释性。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现跨位置信息混合是必需的，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功通常归功于注意力机制，但其中各个设计原则的必要性尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性放松注意力机制的关键原则，包括跨层统一应用和在混合架构中部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: 跨位置信息混合机制不可或缺，其缺失会导致模型性能崩溃；而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是当仅在部分层保留标准注意力时。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的有效性主要源于跨位置信息混合，而非特定数学形式或序列依赖性，这为简化语言模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: AdaKD是一个动态知识蒸馏框架，通过基于token难度的自适应策略优化大语言模型压缩过程，包含损失驱动的token聚焦和逆难度温度缩放两个模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于logit的知识蒸馏方法使用静态策略，与学生学习过程的动态特性不匹配，对所有token一视同仁且使用固定温度，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: 提出LLM导向的Token自适应知识蒸馏(AdaKD)：1) 损失驱动的自适应token聚焦(LATF)模块动态调整蒸馏重点；2) 逆难度温度缩放(IDTS)策略，对困难token使用低温进行针对性纠错，对简单token使用高温鼓励学习完整分布。

Result: AdaKD作为即插即用框架，能够在多种模型架构和基准测试上持续提升各种蒸馏方法的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD通过动态适应每个token的实时学习状态，有效解决了传统静态蒸馏策略的局限性，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Conclusion: MPPA框架通过计划探索和聚合有效解决了长推理链中的规划错误问题，结合在线Step-DPO实现了高效训练和更高的推理准确性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Method: 构建包含计算机科学、经济学、法律、数学和哲学5个领域的50个专家标注学术问题，所有问题来自顶级期刊并经过严格质量控制。

Result: 评估10多个主流LLM和智能体，大多数LLM得分低于20分，最先进的GPT-5仅得16分；智能体得分更高但都不超过40分。

Conclusion: 当前LLM和智能体在超智能学术研究任务中存在能力差距，Acadreason基准具有挑战性。

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: AMA是首个终身实时基准测试，用于评估基于LLM的交易代理在多个市场中的表现，整合了验证的交易数据、专家检查的新闻和多样化的代理架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究中测试模型而非代理、覆盖期有限、依赖未验证数据等问题，为LLM交易代理提供公平、连续的实时评估。

Method: 构建统一的交易框架，实现四种代理：InvestorAgent（单代理基线）、TradeAgent和HedgeFundAgent（不同风险风格）、DeepFundAgent（基于记忆推理），并在多个LLM模型上进行评估。

Result: 实时实验显示代理框架表现出明显不同的行为模式，从激进风险承担到保守决策，而模型骨干对结果变化贡献较小。

Conclusion: AMA为基于LLM的金融推理和交易智能的严格、可重现和持续演进的评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了大型推理模型的"冻结世界"假设，评估了在中断和动态上下文两种现实场景下的模型鲁棒性，发现在动态环境中模型性能可能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是瞬时的且上下文不变，但在现代推理任务中这种假设不成立，需要评估模型在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 通过中断测试（评估有限预算下的部分输出质量）和动态上下文测试（评估模型对飞行中变化的适应能力），在数学和编程基准上评估大型推理模型。

Result: 静态评估高估了模型鲁棒性，即使最先进的模型在动态场景中也会不可预测地失败，性能下降高达60%，特别是在推理过程后期引入更新时。

Conclusion: 发现了新的失败模式，包括推理泄漏、恐慌和自我怀疑，表明需要开发能够处理动态环境的更鲁棒推理模型。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early

Method: TreeNet通过整合神经网络、集成学习和树基决策模型的关键特征，构建分层决策集成学习方法。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，为视觉-语言-动作模型学习紧凑、可转移的动作表示，显著缩短训练序列长度并降低目标熵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在处理动作块时会产生长且高维的序列，先前基于熵引导和词频的技术在压缩时存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 首先通过值范围和时间范围归一化获得一致表示，使用B样条编码；然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，为每个部分生成从粗到细粒度的压缩离散标记。

Result: 在Droid大规模数据集上预训练后，离散标记化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，并降低目标熵。跨具身学习策略进一步利用统一动作模式空间，联合利用机器人和人类演示。

Conclusion: OmniSAT在保持重建质量的同时实现更高压缩，使自回归训练收敛更快且模型性能更好，在多样化的真实机器人和仿真实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MODIS时间序列变化检测中的关键挑战，包括混合像素问题、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应以及背景类别异质性，这些因素使得MODIS变化检测成为高度复杂的任务。

Method: 1）设计知识驱动的转换矩阵方法，提出知识感知转换损失（KAT-loss）；2）采用多任务学习方法，包含预变化分类损失、后变化分类损失和变化检测损失；3）设计新颖的时空谱Mamba（SSTMamba）模块来解耦信息耦合；4）使用稀疏可变形Mamba（SDMamba）骨干网络提高效率。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上评估，变化检测的平均F1分数比基线方法提高约1.5-6%，土地利用/土地覆盖分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标均提高约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法通过整合知识驱动和多任务学习策略，结合高效的Mamba架构，显著提升了MODIS变化检测和分类的性能，为解决MODIS数据中的固有挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过跨模态注意力引导的图像扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，重新分配空间分辨率到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常遗漏小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行直线扭曲，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，同时保留全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲能够优先处理与查询相关的信息，同时保留上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索外语学习的新场景，即学习者在图像-句子配对的多模态语境中推断陌生单词含义，旨在理解影响推断成功的关键因素。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本对，分析数据特征（图像和文本）与参与者语言背景对推断成功的影响，并评估AI系统的预测能力。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了多模态外语学习中影响单词推断成功的因素有限，为改进AI系统的推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应分辨率方法来解决视觉大语言模型在固定分辨率下的性能问题，通过分析任务分辨率偏好并开发参数高效微调技术来优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型通常假设固定分辨率用于下游任务，导致性能不佳。现实世界视觉语言应用需要不同级别的感知粒度，因此需要自适应分辨率方法。

Method: 首先分析不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现分辨率偏好与图像复杂度和VLLM在不同分辨率下的不确定性方差相关。基于此提出经验公式确定最优分辨率，然后开发参数高效微调技术将预训练VLLM扩展到最优分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，相比固定分辨率方法有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应分辨率方法能够有效解决VLLM在固定分辨率下的性能限制，通过结合图像复杂度和模型不确定性来确定最优分辨率，并通过参数高效微调实现分辨率扩展。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测(S-MAD)，通过增量测试协议评估合成数据对泛化能力的影响。结果表明，谨慎控制合成数据数量能改善性能，但仅使用合成数据会导致最差效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像大规模数据集可用性受限的问题，探索合成数据在S-MAD中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像添加而变化的泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示，通过谨慎控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像，可以改善泛化能力；但仅使用合成数据会达到最高的等错误率(EER)。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择是不完全依赖合成数据进行S-MAD，需要平衡使用真实和合成数据以获得最佳性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ceb是一种新的细胞实例分割方法，通过利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素聚类为细胞实例，相比现有方法更好地保留了细胞的几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法使用像素级目标（如距离图、热扩散图等）可能会丢失细胞的重要几何特性（形状、曲率、凸性等），这些特性需要像素集合才能表示。

Method: Ceb首先从语义分割概率图中提取前景-前景边界候选，为每个边界构建边界特征表示（边界签名），使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过区域划分或合并获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力。

Conclusion: Ceb通过利用边界特征有效解决了像素级目标丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAPEL框架，通过聚类感知的提示集成学习改进传统提示集成方法，在分类logits空间进行集成而非特征空间，并引入聚类保持正则化和自适应提示权重技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法在特征空间平均文本特征会导致类别中心偏移真实分布，影响零样本迁移性能。

Method: CAPEL框架：1）将图像分类到多个类别簇；2）在分类logits空间而非特征空间进行提示集成；3）引入聚类保持正则化保持提示特异性；4）自适应提示权重调整技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持提示的聚类特性，提升零样本分类性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL通过聚类感知的提示集成学习框架，有效解决了传统提示集成中的类别中心偏移问题，在保持提示特异性的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多目标跟踪方法，使用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征来生成稳定的物体表示，作为额外的相似性线索，避免计算分割掩码IoU的昂贵计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在物体相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。需要更稳定高效的物体表示方法。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成物体表示。使用零样本深度估计器和提示式视觉分割模型获取深度图和物体掩码。将生成的表示与边界框IoU和重识别特征结合进行匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准测试（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）上，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最先进方法，在简单线性运动基准测试（如MOT17）上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器来优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，为多目标跟踪提供了更稳定高效的解决方案，特别适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Motivation: 现有HDR-VQA数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对真实世界用户生成HDR视频质量退化的理解，特别是由于不同拍摄条件、编辑伪影和压缩失真带来的挑战。

Method: 构建了CHUG数据集，包含856个UGC-HDR源视频，通过多种分辨率和比特率转码模拟真实场景，总计5,992个视频，并通过Amazon Mechanical Turk进行大规模主观研究收集评分。

Result: 创建了首个大规模UGC-HDR视频质量数据集，为分析HDR视频中UGC特有的失真提供了基准。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR-VQA研究，提供了一个大规模、多样化且真实的UGC数据集，该数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常具有不规则布局和复杂结构，包含遮挡和平面墙壁等特征。现有方法采用均匀基础布置效率低下，需要更智能的资源分配策略来充分利用有限的计算资源。

Method: 基于几何支架记录观测统计信息，指导基础的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷并施加正则化约束。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中进行了全面分析，相比采用规则布置的基线方法，在渲染质量和内存需求方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略能够有效利用几何先验，通过智能的基础布置和虚拟视点补偿，显著改善大规模室内场景的神经辐射场表示性能。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常环境中频繁场景变化带来的挑战，传统方法需要密集的空间和时间观测，而稀疏视角的随意拍摄难以满足这一要求。

Method: 构建对象模板高斯作为结构化的可重用先验，通过精炼管道调制先验以适应时间变化环境，基于少样本观测进行优化。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上验证，相比基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时支持快速轻量级更新。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够有效建模长期场景变化，通过简单变换实现多时间步的泛化，显著提升3D环境时间演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计较差，这限制了动物行为量化研究的可靠性。

Method: 采用多视角transformer(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，使用补丁掩码方案学习鲁棒的跨视角对应关系；对于标定设置，通过3D增强和三角化损失引入几何一致性；扩展Ensemble Kalman Smoother(EKS)到非线性情况，并通过方差膨胀技术增强不确定性量化；设计蒸馏程序利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界数据约束下的下游行为分析提供了可靠的多视角姿态估计解决方案，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，一种单步扩散模型，用于端到端地无缝修复和放大肖像图像，解决现有方法在面部区域处理时产生的边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的面部图像。在肖像照片处理中，通常混合使用不同模型，导致面部区域周围出现混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制引导模型关注面部区域，集成基于参考的机制帮助身份恢复，减少低质量面部修复中的面部模糊。构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: HeadsUp在PortraitISR任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp能够无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，有效解决了现有混合方法的面部边界伪影问题，在保持面部保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新方法，用于建模大脑衰老轨迹，通过将纵向MRI数据表示为连续函数来解决传统深度学习方法在处理离散采样数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据在个体内和群体间具有不同的时空采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的INR架构，能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数，并设计了一个直接在INR参数空间上操作的框架来分类大脑衰老轨迹。使用生物基础的轨迹模拟生成了450名健康者和痴呆样受试者的T1加权3D MRI数据。

Result: 在不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在大脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到了81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型的73.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据中的时空采样异质性，为表征大脑衰老轨迹提供了一种有前景的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互式分割框架，通过人类修正作为干预信号来纠正模型对虚假相关性的依赖，从而提高分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 传统分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在真实场景中容易依赖虚假相关性（如颜色、纹理）而非真实物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 采用人机交互框架，将人类修正作为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似的图像，引导模型学习语义特征而非数据集特定伪影。

Result: 在挑战性立方体地图数据上分割准确率提升9 mIoU点（12-15%相对改进），标注工作量减少3-4倍，同时在基准数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应真实世界领域的分割系统提供了实用解决方案，适用于城市气候监测和自动驾驶等应用。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中手动分割耗时且依赖专家经验，以及AI方法需要大量标注数据和泛化能力不足的问题

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征

Conclusion: J-RAS方法能有效提升分割性能，具有良好的通用性和可扩展性

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的端到端交通监控框架，利用现有交通摄像头进行大规模高分辨率纵向分析，通过微调YOLOv11模型提取交通密度和分类指标，结合图基视角归一化方法和领域专用大语言模型，在纽约拥堵收费政策实施期间验证了系统有效性。

Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高昂，而现有视频分析技术难以应对动态摄像头视角和大规模数据量，需要开发成本效益高且可扩展的交通监控解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为实用、基础设施就绪的大规模交通监控解决方案的潜力，能够以最少的人工干预进行政策相关的交通监测。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽略了物理原理，导致模型在真实场景中泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段物理感知方法：参数化模板创建、光照定律感知的2D合成、基于物理引擎的3D渲染，最终生成包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX。

Result: 构建了包含9,500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3,000对光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）的数据集，并通过掩码方法从真实图像中获取无光晕图像用于模型评估。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够更好地适应真实世界场景。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明相互作用产生的闪烁伪影会影响图像质量和高层任务性能，但缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的发展。

Method: 1）基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性；2）采集4000张真实闪烁图像；3）提出绿屏方法在动态场景中保留真实闪烁退化。

Result: 构建了可扩展的基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集有望推动闪烁去除研究的发展。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了医疗视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，能够结合视觉线索和文本指令理解复杂医疗图像，并将医学术语在文本输出中定位到图像中。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

TL;DR: 提出Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter），一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于增强多模态大语言模型，在视频字幕任务中实现高效微调，仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全参数微调相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全参数微调方法在大模型时代计算成本过高，而现有的参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在多模态任务中视觉信息理解不足。

Method: 在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上达到参数高效微调方法中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面具有强大潜力，展示了其在视频-语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Motivation: 现有动态3D高斯泼溅算法忽视了动态场景中显著的时空冗余性，导致内存消耗过高，需要开发更紧凑的4D场景表示方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化策略和基于上下文的熵编码进一步压缩锚点数据。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效的时空压缩技术成功解决了动态3D高斯泼溅的内存消耗问题，为紧凑的4D场景建模提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法难以充分提取多模态系数和时序动态。需要克服这些限制来提升音频-视觉分割性能。

Method: 1. 早期集成模块：并行双边架构融合多尺度视觉特征与音频数据；2. 多查询Transformer模块：动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系；3. 双模态对比学习：在统一特征空间中促进跨模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均创造了新的最先进基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部-全局信息处理和时空上下文捕获，显著提升了音频-视觉分割性能，为多模态分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个模仿人类专家迭代推理过程的医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链进行多步骤视觉推理，在医学诊断任务中优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和优化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，采用"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链进行多步骤视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据。采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调指导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: 广泛评估表明ViTAR优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度，为改进医学AI提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DREAM基准，用于深度伪造视频的视觉真实感评估，包括多样化质量的深度伪造视频数据集、14万个真实感评分和文本描述的大规模标注，以及对16种代表性真实感评估方法的全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注深度伪造检测，而深度伪造的主观感知（特别是其计算建模和模仿）缺乏充分研究。视觉真实感评估对于评估深度伪造的质量和欺骗性、预测其对互联网的影响以及改进深度伪造生成过程具有重要意义。

Conclusion: DREAM基准为深度伪造视觉真实感评估这一新方向的研究奠定了基础，其包含的数据集、标注和评估分析可为相关领域未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

TL;DR: 提出CLSL方法解决多标签图像识别中标签不完整问题，通过语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的协同学习框架，在MS-COCO、VOC2007和NUS-WIDE数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签图像识别面临语义感知特征学习和缺失标签恢复两大核心挑战，需要统一的学习框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了语义相关特征学习模块来学习鲁棒的语义相关特征，提出语义引导的特征增强模块生成高质量判别性语义感知特征，并引入协同学习框架整合语义感知特征学习和标签恢复。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公共数据集上的大量实验表明，CLSL在标签不完整的情况下优于最先进的多标签图像识别方法。

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习语义感知特征和标签恢复，形成了一个相互增强的循环，有效解决了多标签图像识别中的标签不完整问题。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHG-MAE：一种将神经图理论与掩码自编码器结合的新型模型，通过随机掩码整个模态来采样超边分布，将预训练和微调整合到单一训练循环中，支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）无需手动标注数据的优势，将经典的神经图工作与现代掩码自编码器方法在统一理论框架下结合，提升多模态多任务学习性能。

Method: 提出PHG-MAE模型，随机掩码整个模态（不仅是图像块）来采样超边分布，将预训练和微调整合到单一训练循环，支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 模型能够创建推理时集成，通过聚合提升预测性能和一致性，即使参数少于100万的模型也能通过知识蒸馏保持性能。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了有效框架，主要应用于无人机户外场景，但方法可推广到自动驾驶、室内机器人等领域，并发布了相关数据集和代码。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和早期预警至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互优化范式下进行滑坡疤痕的连续识别。

Result: 在巴塘滑坡和色拉滑坡两个案例中验证，能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕演化，捕捉早期预警所需的前兆特征和评估次生灾害所需的后期演化特征。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化，为早期预警和长期稳定性评估提供重要支持。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够在无相机位姿的稀疏图像下实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始位姿和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示、图引导属性优化和流式深度正则化等创新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF和3DGS方法严重依赖准确的相机位姿和密集视角覆盖，限制了在稀疏视角设置下的应用，因为此时位姿估计不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠的初始位姿和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示结合双位置-形状优化和视角间匹配一致性；3) 图引导属性优化模块增强场景细节；4) 流式深度正则化提高深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，相比其他无位姿方法，该方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架成功解决了稀疏视角下3D重建的挑战，通过结合基础模型和多种优化技术，实现了在无相机位姿条件下的鲁棒新视角合成和几何一致重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出了FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并通过部分提示聚合实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的强大零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新的机会，这在无监督联邦学习范式下尚未被充分探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，服务器聚合包含通用图像特征的视觉提示，客户端保留编码个性化知识的文本提示。

Result: 大量实验证明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将无监督联邦学习应用于分类问题，通过伪标签协调和提示聚合实现了有效的协作学习和个性化。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出ACRE方法，通过一致性检查改进GRPO算法，解决强化学习中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，在视频推理和数学推理任务上分别提升2.2%和1.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准GRPO方法在视觉问答任务中推理步骤与答案的一致性仅为79.7%，表明存在推理链与最终答案不匹配的问题。

Method: 修改GRPO算法，增加辅助一致性检查：在模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序，用相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和多模态数学推理基准测试中，相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE方法能有效惩罚推理-答案不一致性，减少模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏见）的依赖，提高推理可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和领域相关视觉线索重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑型深度学习模型（如YOLOv5n和YOLOv8n）在部署到无人机、CCTV系统和物联网设备时，由于容量减少常导致误报和漏检。传统后检测方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂或模糊的火灾场景中可能抑制真阳性或保留误报。

Method: 提出不确定性感知后检测框架，通过轻量级置信度精炼网络整合不确定性估计与颜色、边缘和纹理特征，在不修改基础模型的情况下调整检测分数。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，该方法在精确率、召回率和平均精度方面均有提升，且计算开销适度。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Conclusion: ICFC框架成功利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性的系统开发，为图像取证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手势的帕金森病识别系统性能不佳，需要开发更准确的帕金森病严重程度评估方法，以支持临床管理和干预开发。

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，证明集成空间时间表示与注意力机制可以改进自动PD严重程度检测。

Conclusion: 该系统有望成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展跟踪的有前景的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在低光图像增强和超分辨率任务中均表现出色，以较少的参数实现了高质量的结果，证明了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

*Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Renlong Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于静态和动态3D场景着色的框架，通过个性化颜色器从单张关键视图传播颜色，确保跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持色彩丰富性和用户控制性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。Color3D旨在解决这一问题，在保持一致性的同时保留色彩多样性和可操控性。

Method: 核心方法是仅对单个关键视图着色，然后微调个性化颜色器，将颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用颜色器的归纳偏置将对应颜色一致地投影到新内容中。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致和色彩丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

TL;DR: 提出Stroke Locus Net深度学习管道，使用MRI扫描进行缺血性卒中诊断中的闭塞血管检测、分割和定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习方法主要关注病变分割，在血管定位方面工作有限，缺血性卒中诊断中准确识别闭塞血管位置是关键挑战。

Method: 结合nnUNet分割分支进行病变检测，使用动脉图谱进行血管映射和识别，以及使用pGAN从MRI生成MRA图像的生成分支。

Result: 在卒中影响的T1 MRI扫描上显示出有前景的闭塞血管定位结果。

Conclusion: 该系统有潜力实现更快、更明智的卒中诊断。

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的角色一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单一框架中统一角色一致性生成和编辑任务。生成方法在跨实例的细粒度身份一致性方面表现不佳，而编辑方法往往失去空间可控性和指令对齐能力。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征，将指令嵌入适配到原生DiT主干网络；IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet，从参考图像中解耦语义和布局线索，并引入ε-等变潜在空间在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务，实验验证了其作为统一框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix通过创新的模块设计和潜在空间优化，成功实现了角色一致性图像生成和编辑的统一框架，在保持身份一致性的同时提升了空间可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

*Zhenjie Mao,Yuhuan Yang,Chaofan Ma,Dongsheng Jiang,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架，通过模拟人类认知的两阶段过程来处理复杂的指代图像分割任务，特别是针对对象分散和类别隐式表达等挑战性场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，无法有效处理指代歧义，特别是在对象分散表达和类别隐式表达等复杂场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，模仿人类两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向检查进行精炼。利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性支持多周期精炼。

Result: 在标准数据集和提出的aRefCOCO新基准上进行了广泛实验，证明了SaFiRe相对于最先进基线的优越性。

Conclusion: SaFiRe框架通过模拟人类认知过程有效解决了复杂指代表达的分割问题，在具有歧义的指代表达场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像语义分割对生态监测很重要，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂。稀疏点标签更容易获取，但面临选择标注点和传播稀疏信息的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点标签，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上，SparseUWSeg比现有最优方法提升了高达5%的mIoU。

Conclusion: 开发并发布了简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态学研究者能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于transformer的可视化概念解释框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学数据集上优于现有概念模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在高风险场景（如医疗应用）中的实用性。

Method: 引入多概念可学习token，使用专门的注意力层处理视觉和基于文本的概念token，生成概念级定位图同时保持高预测精度。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的姿态估计方法，通过预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并进行密集采样，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，结合分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)提高姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有姿态估计方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测，忽略了后表面和物体内部的潜在价值。为了充分利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，本研究探索了包含后表面和内部采样的方法。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，在两者之间密集采样3D坐标，创建超密集的2D-3D对应关系，并提出了分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法超越了现有的最先进方法，表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用物体的完整表面和内部信息，结合超密集对应关系和HCCE编码，可以显著提高姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文构建了无人机视频文本匹配数据集DVTMD，并提出TCMA框架，在无人机视频文本检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机产生大量航拍视频，但现有数据集存在标注粗糙和冗余问题，无人机领域的文本-视频检索研究不足。

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集（2864个视频，14320个细粒度标注），提出TCMA框架，包含全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合、词语引导补丁对齐，以及词语和补丁选择模块和文本自适应动态温度机制。

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立首个完整基准，TCMA在文本到视频检索中达到45.5% R@1，视频到文本检索中达到42.8% R@1。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法在无人机视频文本检索中表现出色，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出pseudo-balancing方法，通过在半监督学习中强制伪标签选择时的人口统计平衡，有效缓解人脸性别分类模型中的偏见问题，无需真实标注即可改善公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子群体中表现不均。

Method: pseudo-balancing方法：在伪标签选择时强制人口统计平衡，仅使用种族平衡数据集中的未标记图像，无需真实标注。在两种条件下评估：微调有偏见的性别分类器和使用故意不平衡训练数据模拟偏见场景。

Result: pseudo-balancing一致提高公平性同时保持或增强准确性：总体准确率79.81%（比基线提高6.53%），性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子群体中，基线差距超过49%，该方法将差距缩小至仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度偏斜的未标记数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体定位方法仅建模成对对象的关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致难以处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂描述。

Method: 构建包含n元关系的场景图，使用分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，并采用具有混合注意力机制的多模态网络在n元组合中精确定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能够有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂自然语言描述时表现出色。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AnomReason基准和AnomAgent框架，用于检测和推理AI生成图像中的语义异常，包括不合理的物体配置、物理定律违反和常识不一致等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容(AIGC)快速发展，但许多输出存在细微的语义异常，影响生成场景的整体可信度。检测这些语义级异常对于评估AIGC媒体的可信度至关重要。

Method: 引入AnomReason大规模基准，采用结构化四元组标注(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)，通过模块化多智能体管道AnomAgent进行标注，结合轻量级人工验证。

Result: 在AnomReason上微调的模型在语义匹配指标(SemAP和SemF1)上优于强视觉语言基线，在可解释深度伪造检测和图像生成器语义合理性评估中展示实用价值。

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为测量和改进AI生成图像的语义合理性提供了基础，将发布代码、指标、数据和任务对齐模型以支持可复现研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

TL;DR: 大型视觉模型在零样本设置下可直接应用于医学影像任务，无需医学数据训练即可在器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测等任务中取得竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归视频建模原理是否可直接应用于医学影像任务，即使模型从未接受过医学数据训练。

Method: 在零样本设置下评估大型视觉模型在四个代表性医学影像任务上的表现：器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和放疗运动预测。

Result: 模型能够描绘CT扫描中的解剖结构，在分割、去噪和超分辨率任务中表现优异，在放疗运动预测中超越了专门的DVF基线和生成基线，达到最先进的空间精度。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了医学视频建模中零样本能力的出现，突显了通用视频模型作为统一学习器和推理器的潜力，为未来基于视频模型的医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过使用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量级代理来替代标准的位置梯度启发式方法，结合更保守的修剪策略，显著减少了基元数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法如FSGS虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用不透明度梯度作为新的致密化触发器替代标准位置梯度启发式，结合保守的修剪策略防止破坏性优化循环，并采用标准深度相关损失进行几何指导。

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元数量，在重建质量与效率的帕累托前沿上达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新设计3DGS的核心优化过程，在保持重建质量的同时显著提高了效率，为少样本视图合成建立了新的质量-效率权衡标准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高质量手部纹理先验；2. 设计双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 引入姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Result: 大量实验表明VividAnimator达到最先进性能，生成具有优越手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性的视频，通过定量指标和定性评估验证。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过三个关键创新有效解决了音频和姿态驱动动画中的核心问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰视图特征，无法充分利用细粒度目标细节和空间结构化场景表示的互补优势。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，引入基于基础模型的BEV地图，通过新颖的蒸馏过程将描述性DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，并通过可变形聚合整合PV特征和BEV地图。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DualViewDistill实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结果展示了基础模型BEV地图在实现更可靠自动驾驶感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Motivation: SAM2模型虽然具有快速推理能力，但在眼底图像分割任务中的微调仍然具有挑战性，需要开发参数高效的微调方法。

Method: 在SAM2的图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络调优。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下，血管和视盘分割的Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉，数据有限。生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念。学习可重复布局模式的函数库，使用大语言模型生成高级程序，并学习程序条件模型来分层预测物体姿态。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真、真实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架成功通过分解场景表示和程序化生成方法，解决了真实3D场景合成的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架通过减少重叠率要求，有助于克服AI驱动监测系统在精准农业中的采用障碍，促进技术集成。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，显著提升了模型对未知结构和传感器失真的适应能力。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可有效处理PPG信号，为生理监测提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN在图像分类中的隐藏偏见问题，提出了两种方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在六个数据集上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型，其决策过程难以解释，可能受到背景信息的偏见影响，用户无法了解图像数据如何被分析，只能依赖经验结果。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 将图像分割成不重叠的小块并随机打乱；2) 应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换及其组合来恢复CNN用于分类的背景噪声信息。

Result: 结果表明，该方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，即使在没有背景信息的情况下也能检测到背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够识别CNN中的隐藏偏见，帮助区分有用的上下文信息和有害的背景噪声，提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and

*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait是一个新颖的多模态步态识别框架，通过从2D轮廓直接重建3D热图作为中间表示，有效结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D步态识别方法受视角变化、遮挡和噪声影响，而多模态3D方法虽然更鲁棒但计算成本高。需要一种既能利用3D几何信息又保持计算效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出Mesh-Gait框架，通过重建3D热图作为中间表示，从2D轮廓中提取3D几何信息。采用监督学习逐步重建3D关节、虚拟标记和网格，确保空间对齐和结构一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明Mesh-Gait达到了最先进的识别精度，同时避免了从RGB视频直接进行3D重建的沉重计算开销。

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的3D热图中间表示，成功结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像特征匹配方法在处理大量特征点时耗时较长，特征空间顺序作为独立于极线几何的概念，可以补充指导特征匹配，提高匹配效率。

Method: 将特征空间顺序整合到渐进式匹配框架中，利用初始匹配特征构建空间顺序计算模型，预测后续特征匹配的可能空间范围，过滤不必要的匹配，并与极线几何结合进一步提高效率。提出基于基础矩阵的图像对齐方法来消除图像旋转对特征空间顺序的影响。

Result: 在标准基准数据集、自生成模拟图像和真实图像上进行实验，结果表明所提方法比传统方法显著更高效且具有更准确的特征匹配。

Conclusion: 特征空间顺序与极线几何的结合能够有效提高图像特征匹配的效率和准确性，提出的方法在实际应用中具有良好效果。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征的多模态多任务步态识别框架，同时进行身份识别和人体属性估计，在挑战性条件下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性，需要多模态融合来提升识别性能。

Method: 使用统一transformer融合多模态步态特征，采用多任务学习策略同时进行步态识别和人体属性估计（年龄、BMI、性别）。

Result: 在BRIAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在长距离（1公里）和极端俯仰角（50度）等挑战条件下，在步态识别和人体属性估计方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在真实场景中推进基于步态的人类理解方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，晕动症问题严重阻碍了其广泛应用。现有研究多关注多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征预测晕动症的研究有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络捕捉时间动态并预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法实现了68.4%的晕动症严重程度分类准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和缓解晕动症的实际工具，并为未来基于视频时间建模增强VR用户体验的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个人类化检索增强生成框架，通过"什么-哪里-重加权"级联方法解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提升定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。现有检索增强生成方法只关注全局图像信息，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 采用"什么-哪里-重加权"级联方法：首先通过开放词汇检测将查询锚定到候选参照物（什么），然后用SAM导出的掩码进行空间解析以恢复细粒度精度（哪里），最后通过局部与全局对齐的权衡自适应优先排序（重加权）。掩码引导的微调进一步将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种人类化级联方法提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG框架通过模拟人类视觉推理过程，将定位从被动偏见转变为答案制定的显式约束，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中的关键问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，将无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计建模为条件去噪扩散过程，通过可见性约束扩散和时序感知反向过程实现姿态增强和精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定尺度扰动，缺乏多样性和可见性约束，导致网络泛化能力有限。需要一种能够生成在视野内且多样的训练姿态的方法。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：可见性约束扩散过程用于姿态增强，时序感知反向过程用于渐进姿态精炼。扩散过程将真实姿态扰动为噪声变换，反向过程通过去噪网络迭代预测并精炼姿态。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上表现优异，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散模型实现了更鲁棒和准确的机器人姿态估计，证明了时序感知精炼方案的有效性。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoDeGraph算法解决零样本图像异常分类和分割中一致异常检测问题，通过构建图像级图结构识别并过滤一致异常，在MVTec AD数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致异常（相似缺陷在多个图像中重复出现）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: CoDeGraph算法构建图像级图，将图像作为节点，通过共享一致异常模式的边连接，利用社区检测过滤异常。关键洞察是正常补丁相似度稳定增长，而一致异常补丁在耗尽有限相似匹配后会出现"邻居耗尽"现象。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3% AUROC的异常分类性能，分割性能达到66.8% F1和68.1% AP，相比现有零样本方法分别提升4.2%和5.4%。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升到69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph通过识别和过滤一致异常，显著提升了零样本异常检测性能，并利用极值理论提供了理论支撑，在不同骨干网络上均表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间差异性(IRV)问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢弃临床不确定性信息，需要新的方法来利用分歧中的价值信息。

Method: 使用专家签名生成器(ESG)在潜在空间中表示个体标注者风格，然后通过模拟会诊模块(SCM)从该空间智能采样生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在挑战性的CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果，Dice分数分别达到92.11%和90.72%。

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Motivation: TIPS手术预后结果差异大且常发生肝性脑病，需要准确的术前预后建模。现有方法面临ROI标注耗时、单模态方法可靠性差、单终点预测评估不完整等挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 提出三模块框架：1)双选项分割（半监督+基础模型）实现有限标注下的ROI分割；2)多模态交互（MGRA、POD、CGPE）实现跨模态特征交互；3)多任务预测（生存率、门脉压力梯度、肝性脑病）进行综合预后评估。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的实验表明该方法优于现有先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床应用中具有潜力，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)方法，一种无需训练的推理策略，通过降低视觉-语言注意力来减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像内容无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 通过自适应掩码最影响图像token的注意力权重来退化视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与退化模型输出分布的差异进行解码。

Result: CMG显著减少了语言偏见而不损害VLM能力，在幻觉基准测试中提升了不同VLM的性能，且无需额外条件或训练成本。

Conclusion: CMG是一种有效的训练免费解码方法，能够显著改善视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

*Deng Li,Jun Shao,Bohao Xing,Rong Gao,Bihan Wen,Heikki Kälviäinen,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MSF-Mamba模型，通过运动感知状态融合模块增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，解决了微手势识别中长程依赖和局部模式捕获的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖。CNN擅长局部模式但长程依赖有限，Transformer能处理长程依赖但计算成本高，Mamba虽然高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，通过基于中心帧差分的运动感知状态融合模块融合局部上下文相邻状态，增强Mamba的局部时空建模。还提出了多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Result: 在两个公开微手势识别数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也达到了最先进性能，超越了现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知状态融合有效解决了vanilla Mamba在局部时空建模方面的局限性，能够有效捕捉微手势识别中的细微运动线索，在性能和效率上均表现优异。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

*Yunlong Deng,Guangyi Chen,Tianpei Gu,Lingjing Kong,Yan Li,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究验证了视觉语言模型（VLMs）具有内在的自我精炼能力，能够无需外部输入生成高质量监督数据并自主学习。通过提出的基于三角一致性原则的自精炼框架，模型可以在无外部监督的情况下实现持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无监督指令训练下的潜力，验证其是否具备自我精炼能力，以解决监督视觉指令调优依赖大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自精炼框架：1) 通过多任务指令调优激活指令生成能力；2) 从未标记图像生成图像-查询-答案三元组并用三角一致性过滤；3) 使用过滤后的合成数据更新模型。

Result: 使用LLaVA-1.5作为基线，实验表明模型能够在无任何外部监督的情况下，在多个基准测试中实现持续但适度的改进。

Conclusion: VLMs确实具备自我精炼能力，这一发现可为未来研究VLMs学习机制提供启发，推动无监督学习在视觉语言领域的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

*Jiaye Li,Baoyou Chen,Hui Li,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARoPE是一种针对多维RoPE的改进方法，通过引入可学习的线性变换来解决标准RoPE在图像生成中的局限性，如空间关系建模、颜色线索和物体计数问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的多维RoPE在图像生成中存在三个关键限制：刚性频率分配、轴间独立性和统一头处理，无法有效捕捉细粒度图像生成所需的复杂结构偏差。

Method: 提出HARoPE，在旋转映射前插入通过奇异值分解参数化的可学习线性变换，实现动态频率重分配、旋转平面对齐和头特定位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置特性。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet和文本到图像生成任务上的实验表明，HARoPE相比强RoPE基线和其它扩展方法持续提升性能。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为有效的即插即用替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供原则性和适应性强的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D提出了一种基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过jigsaw操作（空间重排和随机掩码）分离风格与语义内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接参考风格注入或2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，存在计算开销大、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题，需要一种能够解耦风格与内容的高效3D风格迁移方法。

Method: 使用jigsaw操作抑制对象语义并提取风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中，生成视角一致的风格化渲染，最后将渲染风格烘焙到表面纹理。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种高效解耦风格与内容的3D风格迁移方案，在保持高质量的同时大幅降低了计算成本，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: VR-Thinker是一个思考式图像框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让奖励模型能主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决了现有多模态奖励模型在处理长视频时细节丢失和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型面临两个主要限制：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致帧数减少和细粒度细节丢失；(2)所有视觉信息打包到初始提示中，加剧了链式推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：首先通过策划的视觉链式思维数据进行冷启动，然后对判断正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调，最后应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进准确率：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench上82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video上75.6%，特别在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 验证了思考式图像多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景，为视觉生成模型的后训练提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最优格点向量量化器的LUT方法，通过自适应分配量化分辨率、不规则扩张卷积和U形级联LUT结构，在固定表格大小下扩展CNN感受野，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法由于表格大小组合爆炸问题，导致卷积核感受野受限。本研究旨在保持相同空间复杂度的同时，扩展CNN感受野，提升LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Method: 1. 学习最优格点向量量化器，基于数据维度重要性自适应分配量化分辨率；2. 引入不规则扩张卷积；3. 设计U形级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 该方法在速度、精度和内存效率之间实现有效平衡，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法成功扩展了CNN感受野，同时保持了表格大小不变，为LUT驱动的快速CNN推理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 解决开放词汇分割和上下文分割在架构、学习目标和表示学习策略上的不一致问题，构建一个统一的模型来处理这两种任务。

Method: 利用基础模型提取输入图像和多模态提示的表示，设计SegDecoder来对齐这些表示、建模它们的交互，并获取由输入提示指定的不同粒度的掩码。

Result: 综合实验表明，COSINE在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上都有显著的性能提升。探索性分析显示，视觉和文本提示的协同使用相比单模态方法显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE通过统一架构成功整合了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，证明了多模态提示协同使用的有效性，为开世界分割提供了一个强大的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

TL;DR: 提出MCE方法解决多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡问题，通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示能力来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中缺失模态的不平衡问题导致恶性循环：缺失率高的模态更新少，学习进度不一致，表示质量下降，进一步降低其贡献。现有方法主要关注数据集级平衡，忽略了样本级模态效用变化和特征质量下降问题。

Method: 提出MCE方法，包含两个协同组件：1) LCE：引入多级因子动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) RCE：通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MCE通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示能力，有效解决了多模态学习中的缺失模态不平衡问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但具有破坏性的灾害，现有研究数据分散且单一，缺乏用于预测的统一数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测、NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学、MODIS地表温度记录。预处理包括云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和周期性编码，最后进行多模态数据协调。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters

that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis

Conclusion: UniFlow通过语义特征作为视觉条件有效缓解了理解与生成之间的训练冲突，实现了通用视觉建模的统一分词器。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散模型和帧-事件外观-边界融合的新型光流估计框架Diff-ABFlow，解决高速和低光场景下运动模糊和光照不足导致的纹理减弱、噪声放大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光流估计在高速和低光场景中面临挑战，帧相机提供密集外观饱和度但边界完整性稀疏，事件相机提供稀疏外观饱和度但边界完整性密集。现有方法通过特征融合或域适应引入事件数据改善边界完整性，但外观特征仍然恶化，影响判别式和生成式模型的性能。

Method: 采用扩散模型学习从噪声流到清晰流的映射，不受恶化视觉特征影响。提出Diff-ABFlow框架，结合帧-事件外观-边界融合。

Result: 通过扩散模型避免了恶化视觉特征对光流估计的影响，利用帧相机和事件相机的互补特性改善光流估计性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型为光流估计提供了新的解决方案，特别是在恶劣成像条件下，通过帧-事件融合能够有效提升光流估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测中的应用，发现DINOv2模型无需微调即可提供高度判别性的特征空间。针对大规模语义空间场景，提出了MoFE模块和Dynamic-β Mixup策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练视觉基础模型在特征学习方面表现出色，但它们在OOD检测任务中的潜力尚未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 1) 系统评估代表性视觉基础模型在OOD检测中的表现；2) 提出MoFE模块，通过特征子空间划分来捕获复杂数据分布；3) 引入Dynamic-β Mixup策略，根据类别学习难度动态调整插值权重。

Result: 实验表明：1) 预训练DINOv2模型无需微调即可达到现有SOTA方法性能；2) 提出的MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型为OOD检测提供了强大的特征表示能力，而MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略有效解决了大规模语义空间下的优化挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出FSVG方法，通过特征选择机制直接整合语言和视觉模态，避免复杂迭代过程，在视觉定位任务中实现精度和效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要在不同图像尺度上迭代执行，且每次迭代都需要缓存语言和视觉特征，带来额外计算开销。为了简化实现，提出更高效的基线方法。

Method: FSVG方法：1）将语言和视觉模态直接封装到整体网络架构中，避免复杂迭代；2）使用语言作为并行指导促进模态交互；3）引入基于相似度的特征选择机制，仅利用语言相关的视觉特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FSVG在准确性和效率之间达到了比当前最先进方法更好的平衡。

Conclusion: FSVG是一种简单有效的视觉定位基线方法，通过特征选择机制显著减少了计算成本，同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ViSurf是一个统一的后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RLVR)的优势整合到单一阶段中，通过在RLVR过程中注入真实标签来同时提供外部监督和内部强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法中，SFT依赖外部指导但性能次优，RLVR利用内部强化但难以处理超出模型知识范围的任务。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf范式，通过分析SFT和RLVR目标推导出统一目标，在RLVR过程中注入真实标签，并引入三种新颖的奖励控制策略来稳定训练过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf通过统一监督和强化学习范式，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，验证了其推导和设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成链式思维数据集用于监督微调，然后应用组相对策略优化进行后训练，并加入标准差过滤和熵门控机制来稳定训练。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理多任务质量推理，生成连续可解释的奖励信号，并通过稳定化技术提高训练效果和下游泛化能力。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效增强了线性注意力的表达能力，理论上证明了该方法能提高节点表示的可分性，实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

TL;DR: 提出State-Specific Model (SSM)框架，通过关键状态压缩、动作模式学习和跨时间交互，统一提升动作检测和预测性能，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未修剪视频存在大量冗余信息和噪声，且现有方法往往忽略智能体意图对动作的影响。

Method: 1) 关键状态记忆压缩模块压缩帧序列；2) 动作模式学习模块构建多维状态转移图；3) 跨时间交互模块建模意图与过去/当前信息的相互影响。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens-100、THUMOS'14、TVSeries和PDMB等多个基准数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对动作理解至关重要，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别针对散焦模糊或运动模糊，缺乏同时处理两者的能力。虽然两者都可建模为模糊核卷积，但准确估计模糊核存在困难。

Method: 使用模糊预测网络估计每像素可靠模糊核，利用模糊相关场景和相机信息，施加模糊感知稀疏约束；引入动态高斯致密化策略处理不完整区域；结合未见视角信息约束场景优化。

Result: 在散焦模糊和运动模糊的单目视频上，方法在生成逼真新视角合成方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够高质量处理两种模糊类型，代码和训练模型将公开。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only

clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves

Motivation: VR/AR系统需要智能适应用户行为以增强交互体验，这要求准确理解人类意图和预测未来情境行为（如注视方向和物体交互），但现有方法缺乏对驱动人-环境交互的底层认知过程的建模。

Method: 分层意图感知框架：基于历史人类动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；采用动态图卷积网络（GCN）有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现主动式VR系统，预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有效策略，但海量无事件视频使人工检查不切实际，需要自动识别有趣或异常事件的方法。

Method: 引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种基于深度神经网络的视觉异常检测模型，采用稳健的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型性能差异显著，对训练数据量和正常场景视觉内容变异性高度敏感，软标签和共识标签具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 研究为支持科学探索和可扩展生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调了多标注者基准的重要性。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，现有的事后解释方法对模型实际推理过程的忠实度存在不确定性，这促使设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将两张人脸图像的相似度定义为补丁级相似度分数的总和，通过分解全局相似度为受限感受野的贡献来提供局部可加性解释。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过内在可解释的设计实现了竞争性性能，为人脸相似度分析提供了无需事后解释的透明决策过程。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架有效解决了水下图像合成的挑战，在保持风格多样性的同时实现了高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2

clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高、复杂度大，需要减少冗余计算

Method: 使用ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响小的transformer层，Mask-ToMe合并背景令牌，并采用扩散解码器利用时间上下文和姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现2.3倍加速，性能略有提升

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Motivation: 现实世界点云数据集中稀有类别的实例数量有限，导致长尾问题成为主要挑战，需要补充更多稀有类别的数据。

Method: 引入RareBoost3D合成点云数据集补充真实数据集，并提出CSC损失方法进行跨域语义对齐，使不同域中相同类别的特征表示对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种跨域对齐方法显著提升了LiDAR点云分割模型在真实数据上的性能。

Conclusion: RareBoost3D数据集和CSC损失方法有效解决了点云分割中的长尾问题，通过合成数据补充和跨域对齐提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

TL;DR: EarthWhere是一个全面的视觉语言模型图像地理定位基准，包含810张全球分布图像，评估视觉识别、逐步推理和证据使用能力。基准显示Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，准确率56.32%，同时揭示了模型存在区域偏见和推理局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型发展迅速，但在开放世界条件下进行图像地理定位的能力尚未得到全面评估，而这项任务在现实生活中具有挑战性和需求。

Method: 构建EarthWhere基准，包含两个互补的地理定位尺度：WhereCountry（500个选择题，国家级别）和WhereStreet（310个细粒度街道级别任务，需要多步推理和可选网络搜索）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法。

Result: 评估了13个最先进的视觉语言模型，Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强的开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅显示了模型的潜力，也突显了减轻偏见和实现稳健细粒度定位的持续挑战。基准已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

TL;DR: ToMCLIP是一个拓扑感知的多语言CLIP框架，通过拓扑保持约束来对齐嵌入空间，解决了现有多语言扩展方法忽视共享嵌入空间全局几何结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在多语言场景下存在英语偏置问题，多语言扩展方法只关注实例级对齐而忽略了嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出拓扑对齐损失函数，应用持久同调理论，并通过图稀疏化策略近似持久图，具有理论误差界限。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能，增强了多语言表示的结构一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了多语言视觉语言模型的性能，还为表示学习提供了一种通用的拓扑对齐方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer是一个无需训练的基于扩散模型的框架，用于场景图像中文本的灵活高保真风格迁移，支持提示引导的文本区域风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块（利用扩散模型反演和自注意力）、区域控制机制（基于距离的变化掩码）和风格增强模块（基于傅里叶变换）。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面表现出优越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了场景文本灵活风格编辑的挑战，实现了高质量的风格转换效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled
advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和文本模态内对比损失，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度对齐方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境中。CLIP等模型在全局对齐上表现良好，但在对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细粒度细节捕捉上不足，且双语理解支持有限。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配和长文本建模等细粒度监督方法，结合多种判别性目标，并引入文本模态内对比损失来更好地区分语义相似的描述。在精心策划的大规模英中数据混合集上训练。

Result: 在8个任务的29个数据集上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2超越了现有方法，在两种语言上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过创新的细粒度对齐方法，显著提升了双语视觉语言理解能力，为未来的双语细粒度对齐研究提供了有力工具和基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D姿态估计中深度信息丢失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进式姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，提高预测精度并解决对称物体模糊问题。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的广泛实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，在大多数情况下甚至超过RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: DKPMV证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

### [290] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移问题。该指标基于重建稳定性假设：分布内图像重建稳定，分布外图像重建不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题重建中表现良好，但存在分布外图像时可能产生幻觉特征。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集、提供启发式估计或无法区分分布偏移。

Method: 利用重建稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标。通过随机测量变化下的重建变异性来检测OOD图像，无需训练分布知识或重新训练成本。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的模型评估所有十个数字，OOD数字显示出更高的变异性并对应更高的重建误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成先验提供轻量级防护机制，可在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时在先验应用于分布外时自动发出警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树(IUT)的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、实体身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在跨模态图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，这限制了模型在复杂图像-文本输入输出场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次化符号结构；2) 协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准测试的准确性，还在多样化多模态问答场景中有效缓解了三种关键形式的上下文漂移。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理有效解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，提升了模型在复杂跨模态任务中的表现。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务上表现优异，但在分布外数据上表现不佳，且在生成思维链推理时性能进一步下降，限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization结合三个自动可验证的奖励：(1)正确分类图表类型，(2)忠实重建图表数据表，(3)过程一致性。应用于30亿参数的大型视觉语言模型。

Result: Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，缩小了OOD性能差距并提高了推理保真度。Chart-RVR-3B系列在六个图表推理基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出了更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，增强了信任度和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，影响模型的泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Method: 1. MM：在多模态聚合特征层面应用Mixup策略，生成虚拟特征-标签对；2. B-MM：在MM基础上，根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法能有效缓解多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in

prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and

*Ruihang Xu,Dewei Zhou,Fan Ma,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextGen是一个用于多实例图像生成的扩散Transformer框架，通过布局和参考图像指导生成，解决了现有方法在对象布局控制和多主体身份保持方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中面临两个主要挑战：难以精确控制对象布局，以及无法保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。现有方法在这两方面都存在明显不足。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：1) 上下文布局锚定(CLA)机制，将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中以准确定位对象；2) 身份一致性注意力(ICA)机制，利用上下文参考图像确保多个实例的身份一致性。同时构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，ContextGen在控制精度、身份保真度和整体视觉质量方面都优于现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: ContextGen通过创新的CLA和ICA机制，有效解决了多实例图像生成中的布局控制和身份保持问题，为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FASS框架，通过前景感知模块、小波变换频率增强模块和边缘约束模块，解决医学图像中低对比度肿瘤分割难题，在复杂条件下显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难，需要增强模型对目标区域和边界的感知能力。

Method: 1. 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的差异；2. 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取判别性高频特征；3. 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的广泛实验显示，所有指标均优于现有方法，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面表现突出。

Conclusion: FASS框架显著提升了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: COCO-Tree是一种增强视觉语言模型组合推理能力的新方法，通过从大型语言模型学习神经符号概念树来提升VLM的语言推理，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在持续弱点，当任务需要理解图像中多个对象、属性和关系之间的交互时表现不佳。现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出COCO-Tree方法，通过从训练有素的大型语言模型学习精心设计的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用波束搜索启发的推理过程。

Result: 在四个组合性基准测试（Winoground、EqBench、ColorSwap、SugarCrepe）上，七个不同规模的开源VLM中，COCO-Tree将组合泛化性能显著提升5-10%。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree有效提升了VLM的组合推理能力，同时提供了模型预测的可解释理由，在资源效率和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的双分支框架，分别学习视频人体姿态估计中的全局和局部时空表示，解决了现有方法在平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频人体姿态估计方法通常使用单一建模结构（卷积或注意力），难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节的建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长序列建模方面表现出色但仅限于1D数据。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和时空调制扫描融合来提取全局表示，以及基于窗口化时空扫描的局部精化Mamba来增强局部关键点运动的高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba模型用于视频人体姿态估计，有效平衡了全局和局部时空表示的建模，在性能和计算效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非图像编辑，使用强化学习框架提升图表-文本对齐，在几何辅助线推理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在处理几何辅助线时面临挑战，图像编辑方法难以保证几何精度，而文本描述能更好利用模型的表征优势。

Method: 提出强化学习框架，使用跨模态奖励评估生成的辅助线描述与真实辅助线图表的匹配程度，基于GRPO进行RL训练，构建AuxSolidMath数据集支持训练。

Result: 在3B和7B规模下，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有LVLM模型。

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造结合强化学习框架能有效提升几何问题求解能力，GeoVLMath为几何推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估多模态模型理解与生成对齐性及其在复杂视觉任务中泛化能力的严谨基准测试。

Method: 设计三个互补评估维度：理解生成一致性、推理中心文本到图像生成、多步推理编辑，并为每个子集定制专门的评估流程。

Result: 统一模型在推理驱动视觉任务中表现更好，但理解与生成之间仍存在持续差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了全面框架，揭示了理解与生成对齐的挑战，推动了多模态智能的发展。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Conclusion: Vlaser成功整合了高层次推理与低层控制，为具身智能体提供了协同的具身推理能力，并提供了缓解领域转移的有效方法。

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，利用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域而非整个对象；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，实现异常区域的精确分割。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的零样本异常分割结果，特别是在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最佳方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效结合了CLIP和SAM的优势，在零样本异常分割任务中取得了显著性能提升，为工业异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化的数据集，导致深度学习模型开发难以重现。需要建立一个统一的基准数据集来支持AI驱动的临床决策研究。

Method: 从TCIA收集6个数据集的1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取1mm各向同性喉部感兴趣区域。评估了3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101、DenseNet121等架构在早期vs晚期和T4vs非T4分类任务中的表现，并使用3D GradCAM进行模型可解释性分析。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC 0.881，F1-macro 0.821），ResNet18在T4vs非T4分类中表现最好（AUC 0.892，F1-macro 0.646）。可解释性分析显示非T4病例中模型更关注软骨周围区域，而T4预测中呈现局灶性激活。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和集成可解释性工具，为喉癌AI研究提供了可重现的基础，能够支持临床决策制定。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly

architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份一致性的同时实现了精确的面部属性编辑，为真实人脸编辑任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

TL;DR: 提出SeerDrive框架，通过闭环方式联合建模未来场景演化和轨迹规划，显著提升端到端自动驾驶性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态性和时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中的适应性决策能力

Method: 1) 未来感知规划：将预测的BEV特征注入轨迹规划器；2) 迭代场景建模和车辆规划：通过协作优化同时细化未来场景预测和轨迹生成

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 未来车辆轨迹与环境动态演化密切相关，双向建模这种关系能显著提升自动驾驶系统的决策质量

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御方法存在计算成本高、图像质量下降和泛化能力不足等问题。

Method: 使用成对的对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，结合任务特定的方向性指导，并集成提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实世界视频学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验的挑战，以支持从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万多真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，并训练扩散模型进行运动生成。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅合成3D轨迹，还提出了新的2D视频合成流程：先生成MoMap，然后根据其扭曲图像并完成基于点的渲染。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决纵向多模态数据中CXR序列冗余和与EHR时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）在疾病进展建模中至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义的动态变化）以及稀疏、不规则成像数据与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖结构）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对间隔级别）和全局（全序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模一致的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能够有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架成功解决了纵向多模态数据分析中的关键挑战，通过解耦和对齐策略有效建模了疾病进展动态，在多任务预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SynTrans框架，通过多模态知识协同转移增强小样本学习，利用CLIP作为教师模型，通过无监督代理任务和训练无关的协同知识挖掘，实现视觉与语义空间的双向知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小样本学习中数据稀缺问题，现有方法使用小规模模型的语义知识会引入噪声和偏差，需要更有效利用大规模多模态模型的知识。

Method: 1) 使用CLIP作为教师模型，小样本视觉编码器作为学生模型进行知识蒸馏；2) 训练无关的协同知识挖掘模块；3) 视觉-语义桥接模块实现双向知识转移；4) 视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器构建多模态分类器。

Result: 在四个小样本学习数据集上的实验表明，即使搭配简单的小样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大规模多模态模型的多样化知识，成功提升了小样本学习的性能，证明了多模态知识协同转移的有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散模型在文本到图像生成中的计数能力问题，发现单纯扩大模型和数据规模无法提升计数准确性，并提出了一种通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来有效控制生成对象的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型（如FLUX和GPT-4o）在遵循文本提示中的计数指令方面存在困难，本文旨在探究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成指定数量的对象。

Method: 构建了两个互补的合成计数基准数据集（GrayCount250和NaturalCount6），通过实证研究验证缩放假设，并提出了一种通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来控制生成对象的数量。

Result: 实验表明缩放假设不成立：更大的模型和数据集无法提高计数准确性。提出的方法在GrayCount250上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型倾向于依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确计数信息，噪声先验对特定对象数量存在偏见。通过注入计数感知布局信息可以有效控制生成对象的数量，并在不同设置下展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS、360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练记忆模块和提示相关记忆读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展到长视频流处理，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法通过合并或丢弃token会丢失信息。

Method: 引入测试时训练记忆模块持续更新token表示以捕获长程依赖，以及提示相关记忆读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容，使用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试中，8B参数模型在包含10k帧和100万token的多小时视频上保持高质量理解，Video-MME长分割上达到67.8%，总体74.2%，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S证明了在固定内存预算下处理极长视频流的可行性，为未来AI代理的高帧率、高分辨率连续视频处理提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，而SDF是男性生育能力评估的关键参数，需要开发非破坏性的实时检测方法。

Method: 提出形态学辅助集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，通过相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性进行实时精子选择，具有临床诊断和治疗应用价值。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽视不同视图位于不同流形结构且重要性不同，同时忽略不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，用可信多视图证据融合替代softmax分类器，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习与证据融合统一，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上达到或超越了现有最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么仅表示文本中的位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。需要一种更清晰、可解释的方法来连接推理和分割。

Method: 使用多模态思维链(MCoT)生成可微分的位置先验热图，通过可学习的集中标记聚合图像和推理文本特征，然后通过轻量级解码器生成精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集的可比较协议下，CoPRS在标准分割上匹配或超越了最佳报告指标，在验证和测试集上的性能达到或超过先前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响最终掩码质量，支持推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致性关联。该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性，在集中性和掩码预测精度方面显示出优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制嵌入交互中的风格干扰来提升语义对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格信息）的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离风格和语义信息，但现有方法基于特征列区分无法表示复杂的耦合关系。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列代表语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用原型迭代构建方法确保语义概率的可靠性，关键操作是基于性能反馈的加权函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络上进行广泛实验，PICO优于最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐性能，证明了语义概率量化和原型迭代构建方法的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出G2L框架，通过知识蒸馏将千亿级病理基础模型的能力迁移到仅含15%参数的大规模模型，在癌症特定任务中达到可比性能，且仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型因计算成本过高而难以实际应用的问题，寻求在保持高性能的同时大幅降低参数和计算需求的方法。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，使用目标癌症的少量病理切片（1000张），将千亿级教师模型的能力迁移到大规模学生模型。

Result: 蒸馏后模型在多个基准测试中优于同规模SOTA模型，甚至在某些基准上超越了千亿级教师模型和更大规模模型，且展现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，可在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化背景知识的理解能力变得至关重要。现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能验证模型是否具备鲁棒且可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、倒置文本变体和VQA风格版本，包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例。

Result: 发现当前VLM文化知识存在显著脆弱性，模型在语言改写下性能下降，视觉线索虽常有助于性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，尤其是对资源较少地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Motivation: 探索沙特手语翻译的挑战，特别是面部遮挡等独特特征对手语识别和翻译的影响，并研究利用大规模美国手语数据来改进沙特手语翻译的可能性。

Method: 使用T5模型，比较在YouTubeASL数据集上预训练的模型与直接在沙特手语数据集上训练的模型性能，采用包含三种测试协议的新数据集进行综合评估。

Result: 预训练在YouTubeASL上的模型性能显著优于直接训练的模型，BLEU-4指标提升约3倍，表明手语模型具有良好的跨语言可迁移性。

Conclusion: 利用大规模美国手语数据可以有效改进沙特手语翻译系统，为开发更有效的手语翻译系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出了FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型的中间层表示来控制联想推理强度，在创造性和事实性任务间实现灵活平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了MLLMs在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。

Method: FlexAC框架：1) 诱导幻觉引导的中间表示编码联想方向；2) 选择高联想实例构建有效联想导向向量；3) 自适应校准强度平衡创造指导与输出稳定性；4) 结合任务特定联想向量适应多样化任务。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC能够有效调节MLLMs的联想推理行为，在保持事实准确性的同时增强创造性能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

Motivation: 随着儿童早期在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动工具帮助教育工作者筛选适合年轻学习者的教育内容。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，学习每个类别的原型，最小化类别原型与同类样本的距离，最大化与其他类别样本的距离。使用多模态transformer网络捕捉视频中视觉和音频线索的交互。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法优于YouTube-8M和COIN等基准数据集上的强基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测在线视频中的教育内容，为筛选适合儿童的教育视频提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分就能识别个体身份，无需依赖静态面部特征。使用FLAME 3D模型分离面部形状和表情动态，在1,429人的对话视频数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率，远高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索面部表情动态是否包含独特的个人身份信息，独立于静态面部外观，这对于理解社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下颌系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习在CANDOR数据集上进行1,429路分类。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性。

Result: 在1,429人的分类任务中达到61.14%准确率，是随机水平的458倍。DNR与识别性能呈强负相关，表明不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别效果。

Conclusion: 对话中的面部动态包含强烈的个人身份特征，这一发现对社交感知和临床评估具有重要启示。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度和更好的跨临床场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑。图像分类中的编辑研究有限，需要克服这些挑战。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。与任务向量在权重空间中编码任务级变化不同，Class Vectors在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应过程。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，通过沿这些向量引导潜在特征或将其映射到权重空间来更新决策边界。Class Vectors的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效的概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors在类别遗忘、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其实用性，为图像分类器提供了灵活高效的编辑方法。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Conclusion: 明确建模人类不确定性比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效，更好地利用不确定性可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD检测分数，通过降低最大余弦相似度来显著提升视觉语言模型的OOD检测性能，并同时改善协变量偏移下的OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中会遇到分布内数据和分布外数据，其中OOD数据包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提升模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 基于视觉语言模态重新对齐时观察到的显著能量变化，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并通过下界最大化(EBM)同时提升OOD检测和泛化性能。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，该方法比现有方法在AUROC指标上提升了10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy提供了一个统一的微调框架，能够同时提升视觉语言模型在OOD泛化和OOD检测方面的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

TL;DR: 本文首次对监督学习检测器(YOLO)和零样本视觉语言模型(Gemini)进行成本效益分析，建立了架构选择的定量平衡点阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM无需标注但精度较低，需要系统比较两者的成本效益以指导实际部署选择。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总体拥有成本建模，分析准确率和成本效益。

Result: 监督YOLO准确率91.2% vs 零样本Gemini 68.5%，但需要$10,800标注成本；Gemini在罕见类别可达52.3%准确率而YOLO为0%；每正确检测成本Gemini为$0.00050 vs YOLO $0.143。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算限制和精度要求，而非纯技术性能指标，监督学习仅在超过5500万次推理时具有成本效益。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

TL;DR: Sketch2Symm是一个两阶段生成方法，通过语义桥接和对称约束从草图生成几何一致的3D形状


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建中由于草图抽象稀疏、缺乏足够语义和几何信息导致的挑战

Method: 两阶段生成：1）通过草图到图像翻译进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2）引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上，在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score指标上优于现有方法

Conclusion: 验证了语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR图像预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法对洪水模拟的影响，发现方法选择和参数调整会显著影响结果准确性，建议采用集成方法而非单一配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对于校准和验证水力模型至关重要，但现有方法在预处理、洪水制图和水深估计各步骤中的选择和参数调整对结果的影响尚未系统研究。

Method: 使用SAR图像，通过集成预处理图像、洪水图和水深场，评估不同预处理（特别是斑点噪声去除）、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数的影响，以法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件为案例。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可达到类似结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的累积不确定性导致水深估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 应考虑包含预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数的完整处理流程，优先采用集成方法和考虑方法不确定性；洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中洪水图输入和方法超参数影响最大。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Conclusion: 统一建模方法能够促进正向迁移并提高整体性能，为SVG理解、编辑和生成提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率补丁表示和原型增强架构，解决空间转录组学中从H&E染色图像预测基因表达的两个关键挑战：局部特征提取粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学(ST)能够测量基因表达并保留空间信息，但现有方法在从H&E染色全切片图像预测转录组范围基因表达时面临两个主要限制：局部特征提取粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分。

Method: 提出MMAP框架：1) 使用多放大倍率补丁表示来增强局部特征粒度，捕捉细粒度组织学细节；2) 学习一组潜在原型嵌入作为切片级信息的紧凑表示，改善全局上下文理解。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，MMAP在多个评估指标（平均绝对误差MAE、均方误差MSE、皮尔逊相关系数PCC）上始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP框架通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局上下文覆盖的挑战，显著提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

TL;DR: DocReward是一个文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和风格质量，解决了现有代理工作流主要关注文本质量而忽视视觉结构和样式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理工作流自动化主要关注文本质量，忽略了视觉结构和样式对可读性和参与度的重要性，这主要是由于缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导工作流生成具有更强结构和样式质量的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对文档内容相同但结构和样式不同。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型，通过惩罚与人工标注排名相矛盾的预测来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外在评估中，DocReward获得了60.8%的胜率，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward在评估文档结构和样式质量方面表现出色，能够有效指导生成代理产生更受人类偏好的文档，解决了现有代理工作流在视觉结构和样式方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复现原始训练分布，数据增强效果有限。需要利用未标记域数据来扩展控制能力，特别是在存在大域偏移的场景中。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域标注数据的ControlNet。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的方法能够实现任意域偏移，无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域数据增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: 通过将冗余视觉表示转换为紧凑的跨域对齐文本表示是实现泛化的关键，RALI提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Conclusion: 多视角一致的材料推断结合更物理的环境建模是学习准确反射的关键，该方法在高斯泼溅中实现了逼真的反射渲染。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合高分辨率卫星图像和AIS数据的框架，用于内陆水道海事感知，通过YOLO v11模型检测船舶并识别多种属性，有效解决了AIS系统的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内陆水道海事感知中合作系统（AIS）的脆弱性问题，通过非合作卫星图像与AIS数据融合来识别黑船、验证合作交通并支持高级MDA。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型从卫星图像中检测船舶，结合AIS轨迹数据进行数据融合，开发了包含4,550个实例的标注数据集。

Result: 船舶分类F1分数95.8%，驳船覆盖检测91.6%，运行状态分类99.4%，方向性准确率93.8%，驳船计数MAE为2.4，空间可转移性准确率高达98%。

Conclusion: 融合非合作卫星传感与AIS的方法是可行的，能够实现近实时船队盘点、支持异常检测并为内陆水道监视生成高质量数据。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VGDCFusion方法，将退化建模与图像融合过程紧密耦合，利用视觉语言模型进行退化感知和引导抑制，显著提升退化场景下的红外与可见光图像融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法假设输入为高质量图像，在处理退化图像时需要手动切换预处理技术，导致退化处理与图像融合解耦，性能显著下降。

Method: 使用特定提示退化耦合提取器(SPDCE)实现模态特定的退化感知，联合建模退化抑制和模态内特征提取；并行使用联合提示退化耦合融合(JPDCF)促进跨模态退化感知，将残差退化过滤与互补跨模态特征融合耦合。

Result: 大量实验表明，VGDCFusion在各种退化图像场景下显著优于现有最先进的融合方法。

Conclusion: VGDCFusion通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效解决了退化图像融合问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强3D高斯泼溅几何表示的新方法，通过视图对齐技术改进表面重建质量，在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的表面重建和新视角合成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然在新视角合成方面表现出色，但其表面重建能力尚未充分探索。由于高斯点的离散和非结构化特性，仅基于图像渲染损失的监督往往导致不准确的几何形状和不一致的多视图对齐。

Method: 1) 将边缘感知图像线索融入渲染损失以改善表面边界描绘；2) 引入可见性感知的光度对齐损失来建模遮挡并促进高斯点间的准确空间关系；3) 加入基于法线的约束来细化高斯点的空间方向并改进局部表面估计；4) 利用深度图像特征嵌入来增强跨视图一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐技术增强3D高斯泼溅的几何表示，有效解决了现有方法在几何准确性和多视图一致性方面的局限性，为高质量的3D重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Conclusion: 该方法通过分量级优化显著提高了法向积分的计算效率，为大规模表面重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知变化理解任务，包含12.1万个问答对、3.6万个变化描述和1.7万个重排指令。该数据集利用1.1万个人类观察构建共享心智模型，并提出SCReasoner方法有效比较点云变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准倾向于孤立处理动态场景或动态情境，导致理解不完整。为了克服这些限制，需要构建能够支持情境感知变化理解的综合数据集。

Method: 利用1.1万个人类观察建立共享心智模型，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系。提出SCReasoner方法，这是一种高效的3D多模态大语言模型方法，能够以最小参数开销有效比较点云变化。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估突显了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据扩展和跨领域迁移实验表明，使用Situat3DChange作为训练数据集对MLLMs具有任务无关的有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange为动态场景理解提供了重要数据集，SCReasoner方法在点云比较方面表现出色，为人类-AI协作中的共享情境感知奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中将物理正确性与视觉外观分离，准确评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Conclusion: 尽管当前模型在复杂和混沌动力学方面存在困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现明显改善趋势。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解而难以实现安全导航。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，包含多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征；创建mmWalkVQA视觉问答基准测试；评估现有视觉语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下的表现；对模型进行微调并在真实世界数据集上验证。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，为盲人和低视力人群提供更安全的户外导航解决方案。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

Motivation: DiT内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出细节引导(DG)方法，通过破坏大规模激活构建退化模型，然后利用其引导原始网络进行更高质量的细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DG能持续提升各种预训练DiT的细粒度细节质量，包括SD3、SD3.5和Flux等模型。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在局部细节合成中起关键作用，提出的DG方法能有效增强DiT生成图像的细节保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像和视频理解上表现优异，但在理解全景图像提供的沉浸式环境方面能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含2000张全景图像和4000个问答对的ODI-Bench基准，并提出无需训练的Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理整合文本和视觉信息。

Result: 实验发现当前MLLMs难以捕捉全景图像的沉浸式上下文，而Omni-CoT方法显著提升了模型在全景环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了全景图像理解领域的空白，为未来相关研究提供了基准和方法支持。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Motivation: 胸部X光分类任务通常需要大量标注数据，但基础模型能减少这种依赖。然而，具体需要多少标注样本才能达到特定性能水平仍不明确，这阻碍了实际应用中标注成本的优化。

Method: 使用幂律拟合方法系统评估预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需的训练样本数量。测试了多种病理类型和基础模型，包括XrayCLIP、XraySigLIP和ResNet-50基线模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线模型能用显著更少的标注样本获得强性能。仅使用50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台期。

Conclusion: 研究结果使实践者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本量来最小化标注成本，为胸部X光分类任务的资源优化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Method: 在7个跨领域数据集上训练，采用域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码提案并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配，支持全景和开放词汇分割。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并在大规模场景上预训练变换器，ACE-G方法成功解决了传统场景坐标回归方法的泛化限制，实现了更好的重定位性能。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个专门评估多模态大语言模型在科学实验视频理解能力的基准，通过三级任务层次（细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理）系统测试模型性能，发现现有模型在细节区分、状态跟踪和科学推理方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学发现中的实际能力，需要建立更贴近真实实验场景的评估体系。

Method: 从同行评审视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三级任务层次结构，结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程，评估19个领先MLLMs。

Result: 模型在粗粒度识别方面表现良好，但在区分细节、跟踪状态变化和连接实验程序与科学结果方面表现不佳，专有模型与开源模型在高级推理上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的MLLMs绘制了路线图，揭示了当前模型在科学实验理解方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么注重性能但无法在边缘设备部署，要么注重计算效率但实际应用性能不足，需要平衡性能与效率的方法。

Method: 使用图像自适应的3D LUT利用下采样图像的全局色调特征，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，并通过局部拉普拉斯滤波器自适应细化高频细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像在单GPU上仅需13毫秒处理时间，在两个基准数据集上表现优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++成功平衡了照片增强的性能与效率，实现了高性能的实时图像增强处理。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: NV3D是一种新颖的3D物体检测模型，通过从体素邻居提取法向量特征来增强特征表示，并提出两种采样策略可减少55%数据量而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取方法对于复杂3D检测任务可能过于简化。需要一种更好的方法来丰富特征表示。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量特征，提出密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样策略，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，无采样时汽车检测mAP达86.60%，骑行者检测达80.18%，分别比基线提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样后仍保持85.54% mAP，同时过滤掉约55%体素。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效捕捉表面与目标实体关系，采样策略显著减少计算量，注意力融合机制提升特征表示能力，特别适用于具有空间形状的目标检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D

### [372] [Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690)
*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出用表示自编码器(RAE)替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE的架构过时、潜在空间维度低、表示能力弱等问题，通过理论分析和实验验证，在ImageNet上取得了优异的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散变换器使用的VAE编码器存在多个限制：架构过时影响简洁性、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、纯重建训练导致表示能力弱，最终影响生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练表示编码器（如DINO、SigLIP、MAE）配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器(RAE)，分析高维潜在空间中扩散变换器的困难来源，提出理论解决方案，并使用配备轻量级DDT头的DiT变体。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得优异结果：256x256无引导FID为1.51，256x256和512x512有引导FID均为1.13，收敛更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的贝叶斯拓扑CNN，结合拓扑感知学习和贝叶斯采样，在数据有限或损坏的情况下提供更好的不确定度量化和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN需要大量训练数据、产生过度自信预测以及缺乏不确定度量化能力的问题。

Method: 将拓扑信息与贝叶斯学习相结合，在网络参数上放置先验分布并学习适当后验，在学习成本中包含一致性条件来改进先验分布。

Result: 在基准图像分类数据集上优于传统CNN、贝叶斯神经网络和拓扑CNN，特别是在训练数据有限或损坏的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力，能更好地识别分布外数据并提供更好的不确定度量化。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360是一个基于DiT的框架，通过混合训练透视和全景数据来生成全景图像，重点解决几何保真度和照片真实感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型设计，但全景图像生成质量不佳的主要原因是缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据。

Method: 采用图像级和标记级的跨域转换与域内增强：图像级通过透视图像引导和全景细化引入跨域知识；标记级应用混合监督，包括循环填充、偏航损失和立方体损失。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外绘任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的几何保真度和照片真实感。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练视频扩散模型进行零样本点跟踪，通过在查询点放置彩色标记并重新生成视频来传播标记轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，使标记在帧间传播。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 通过多个图像条件视频扩散模型的实验，发现这种"涌现"跟踪优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型能够有效执行零样本点跟踪任务，展示了跟踪和视频生成之间的紧密联系。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS是首个仅从单目事件流中渲染非刚性变形物体新视角的方法，使用可变形3D高斯泼溅表示，无需RGB输入即可在显式观察空间中生成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理非刚性物体时需要额外的稀疏RGB输入，这在实际应用中存在限制。本文探索是否仅从事件流中就能学习类似模型，解决这一具有挑战性的开放问题。

Method: 通过两种方式回归可变形3D高斯泼溅表示：1) 将估计模型输出与2D事件观察空间相关的损失函数；2) 从事件生成的二值掩码训练的粗糙3D变形模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，Ev4DGS的有效性，并且相比多个可应用的朴素基线方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: Ev4DGS证明了仅从事件流中学习非刚性物体新视角渲染的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景重建中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CodePlot-CoT方法，通过代码驱动的思维链范式，让模型在数学推理中生成可执行的绘图代码作为"视觉思考"，解决需要视觉辅助的数学问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM和VLM在需要视觉辅助的数学问题上存在瓶颈，无法生成精确可控的图像来辅助推理，而多模态统一模型又缺乏必要的精度和可控性。

Method: 1) 构建Math-VR双语数据集和基准测试；2) 开发专门的图像到代码转换器；3) 训练CodePlot-CoT模型，让VLM生成文本推理和可执行的绘图代码，渲染成图像作为视觉思考。

Result: 在新建的基准测试上，模型相比基础模型提升了21%，验证了代码驱动推理范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 为多模态数学推理开辟了新方向，提供了首个大规模数据集、综合基准测试和有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的综述论文大量涌现，虽然降低了写作门槛，但带来了冗余、低质量甚至包含虚构内容的论文泛滥问题，威胁研究社区的学术诚信和信任体系。

Method: 通过定量趋势分析、质量审计和文化影响讨论，识别AI生成综述论文的问题，并提出解决方案。

Result: 发现AI生成综述论文存在严重质量问题，包括内容冗余、质量低下和虚构信息，已对研究社区造成实质性危害。

Conclusion: 必须立即采取措施阻止AI生成综述论文的泛滥，建立AI使用规范、专家监督机制和动态实时综述基础设施，以保护研究社区的完整性。

Abstract: Survey papers are foundational to the scholarly progress of research
communities, offering structured overviews that guide both novices and experts
across disciplines. However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys,
especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this
traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output.
While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical
threat: the phenomenon we term the "survey paper DDoS attack" to the research
community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially
comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey
manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and
erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we
must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey
paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for
AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and
transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as
Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories
that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend
analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that
safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to
the research community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种群体自适应对抗训练策略，通过将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三类，使用LLM生成多样化攻击，并应用Dirichlet自适应采样机制来增强假新闻检测模型的鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但对真实用户或大型语言模型生成的对抗性评论攻击仍然脆弱，这些攻击会微妙地改变模型决策，影响社交媒体平台的信任度。

Method: 1) 将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三类；2) 使用LLM生成多样化的类别特定攻击以增强对抗训练；3) 应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制，在训练过程中动态调整不同评论类别的学习重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强大检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效提升了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，为构建更可靠的社交媒体内容检测系统提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索完全基于自然语言定义模型的新方法，避免传统数值优化，提高模型的可解释性和透明度。

Method: 使用自然语言定义模型，通过解释性提示迭代优化分类标准，在3个合成和3个自然数据集上测试，与7个基线可解释机器学习模型比较。

Result: 在6个数据集中，5个数据集上Narrative Learning的准确率优于基线可解释模型，归因于语言模型的改进。同时分析了输出词汇统计趋势作为解释可理解性的代理指标。

Conclusion: Narrative Learning方法显示出潜力，在多数数据集上优于传统可解释模型，且随着语言模型改进，其性能有望进一步提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用机器学习从经典形容词列表构建自下而上的人格模型，与Big Five模型在Reddit评论中比较。结果发现Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）能更好地描述在线社区，而机器学习聚类缺乏区分度和心理测量一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证词汇假说，测试机器学习能否替代传统人格模型，检验Big Five模型在在线环境中的生态效度。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建人格模型，分析100万条Reddit评论，与Big Five模型进行对比评估。

Result: Big Five模型在描述在线社区方面更强大且可解释，特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质维度。机器学习聚类未能提供有意义的区分，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构具有情境依赖性。机器学习可用于检验心理学理论的生态效度，但可能无法替代传统模型。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全的智能代理系统提供了实用模板，通过解决数据、模型和评估三个关键差距，实现了在规划阶段的可靠安全防护。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Motivation: 自注意力能够自适应识别相关元素但依赖绝对位置嵌入，卷积具有相对编码优势但固定核大小限制了自适应选择能力。需要一种统一两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Translution操作，结合自注意力的自适应识别和卷积的相对编码。由于参数过多，进一步提出轻量级变体α-Translution。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上的实验表明，Translution（包括α-Translution）相比自注意力获得了更优的准确率。

Conclusion: Translution成功统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时解决了参数过多的问题。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统基于二元验证的RLVR方法容易忽略推理轨迹中的有价值探索，而构建黄金过程奖励模型成本高昂。现有方法使用熵和似然等辅助信号进行奖励塑造，但潜在空间的表达能力尚未充分探索。

Method: RLFR从离策略高质量数据或在线拒绝采样数据构建模型潜在空间的流场，量化策略潜在在流场中的速度偏差作为奖励信号。该方法能够压缩任何离策略专家数据作为奖励参考，利用隐藏状态中的高效上下文依赖。

Conclusion: RLFR展示了良好建立的流场可以作为奖励信号收集的可靠环境，为使用辅助信号进行奖励塑造提供了一个有前景的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA基准测试中，ECHO比普通语言代理基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中，还超越了Reflexion和AWM等复杂代理架构，通过更有效地利用过往经验实现更快的新环境适应。

Conclusion: ECHO通过后见之明优化显著提升了语言模型代理的样本效率和学习能力，特别是在交互成本高的环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

TL;DR: PerSyn提出了一种新的"路由后生成"数据合成策略，通过查询级路由器为每个学生模型分配最优教师，生成个性化数据以提高学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，更强的模型并不总是最优教师，存在教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题。

Method: 采用"路由后生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器根据学生可学习性和教师响应质量为每个提示分配最优教师，然后各教师仅为分配到的提示生成数据。

Result: 在不同模型家族和规模上的广泛实验表明，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中始终优于或与所有基线方法相当。

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并提供了推动未来研究的额外见解。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，通过动态调整熵正则化系数来解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃，导致策略过于确定性，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，难以适应不同任务和模型的需求。

Method: 提出AER框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵、动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER始终优于基线方法，显著提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了更稳定有效的方法。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: 提出了ELMO框架，使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型进行纯低精度训练，通过Kahan求和和随机舍入技术，在极端多标签分类任务中实现显著的内存节省和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端多标签分类(XMC)中线性分类头成为计算和内存需求的主要驱动因素，现有FP16-FP32混合精度训练存在不稳定、内存使用低效和计算开销大的问题。

Method: 使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，结合Kahan求和与随机舍入技术，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放；采用梯度融合和分块等内存优化策略。

Result: 在300万标签的XMC模型中仅使用6.6 GiB GPU内存，相比优化后的SOTA方法Renee的39.7 GiB显著减少，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: ELMO框架证明了XMC模型可以完全在Float8中有效训练，实现了显著的内存节省和计算效率提升。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种无需训练的生代方法，通过基于token熵分布的不确定性来动态分配计算预算，减少冗余计算并提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理语言模型在生成多个候选序列时对所有提示分配相同计算预算，但不同提示的复杂度不同，需要不同的计算需求。

Method: 利用token-wise熵分布检测不确定性，仅在出现高熵token时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，相比完整并行采样，生成token减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过基于不确定性的动态计算分配，有效提升了推理模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: 工具增强强化学习具有显著的跨领域泛化潜力，TGRL框架通过促进领域无关的学习和技能迁移，为LLM推理的跨领域应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: 推理、对齐和鲁棒性是单一信息几何目标的不同投影，ENIGMA训练出的模型无需奖励模型即可展示原则性推理。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook在视觉基础前端代码生成方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 代理感知、视觉奖励和训练-推理解耦的组合带来了显著优势，证明了该框架在前端开发中的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Result: 在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中，BGPO显著优于之前的RL算法

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的算法设计，能够采用更大的MC样本量，提供更准确的似然近似和RL目标估计，从而提升性能

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Motivation: 传统RL训练LLM需要大量GPU内存和长时间rollout，资源消耗大。QeRL旨在解决这些效率问题，同时利用量化噪声增强策略探索。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声(AQN)机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平。

Result: 实现rollout阶段1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在GSM8K(90.8%)和MATH 500(77.4%)等数学基准上达到全参数微调性能。

Conclusion: QeRL是LLM强化学习训练的高效有效框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Motivation: 当发布新的基础模型时，即使相同任务已在先前版本中解决，从业者通常需要重复完整微调。任务向量虽然能捕获模型如何适应特定任务，但由于参数空间不对齐，往往无法在不同预训练模型间成功传输。

Method: 基于梯度符号结构是成功传输的关键这一洞察，提出GradFix方法：近似理想梯度符号结构，利用少量标注样本计算目标模型的几个梯度，并相应掩码源任务向量，实现局部对齐目标损失景观的更新。

Conclusion: GradFix通过梯度符号结构实现了任务向量在不同预训练模型间的有效传输，无需额外微调，仅需少量样本即可获得优越性能。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的调控手段。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案有效解决了跨模态哈希中的语义交互问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCAL-R是一个基于神经崩溃几何的可靠主动学习框架，通过类均值对齐扰动和特征波动两个几何信号来对抗不可靠的监督，在噪声标签和分布偏移情况下优于传统主动学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时不可靠，会放大标注错误和冗余样本的选择问题。

Method: 提出两种互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的影响）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练过程中表征的时间不稳定性），结合这些信号选择样本。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下具有更高的准确率、更强的鲁棒性，并能更好地泛化到分布外数据。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入主动学习样本选择决策中，可以减少对标注错误和分布偏移的脆弱性，是实现可信赖部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

*Lianghuan Huang,Yingshan Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了在视觉Transformer中可解码性和因果性之间的系统性不匹配：中间层的对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，而最终层的对象token支持准确解码但功能上无影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是理清神经网络中经常被混淆的两个概念：可解码性（从隐藏状态恢复信息的能力）和因果性（这些状态对输出的功能影响程度），特别是在视觉Transformer中进行对象计数的场景。

Method: 方法包括使用激活修补技术测试空间和CLS token的因果作用，通过移植干净-损坏图像对之间的激活；同时训练线性探针来评估不同深度处计数信息的可解码性。

Result: 结果显示系统性不匹配：中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能上无影响；CLS token在中间层变得可解码但只在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 结论是可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——存在什么信息与使用什么信息——它们的差异可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

TL;DR: Decomposer Networks (DecompNet) 是一种语义自编码器，通过并行分支和残差输入分解输入为多个可解释组件，采用类Gauss-Seidel的块坐标下降方法实现组件间的显式竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自编码器将输入压缩为单一潜在表示，而DecompNet旨在将输入分解为多个语义明确的组件，实现更可解释的表示学习。

Method: 使用N个并行分支，每个分支处理原始信号减去其他分支重建结果的残差输入，通过展开Gauss-Seidel风格的块坐标下降构建可微分网络。

Result: 模型能够产生简洁且语义有意义的表示，组件间存在显式竞争关系。

Conclusion: DecompNet是首个实现"除一之外"残差更新规则的语义自编码器，在可解释表示学习方面具有创新性。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic
MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the
response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we
introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed
for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models
(featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22
Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9
implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems,
offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of
different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。移除这些假设会导致黑盒攻击性能显著下降。

Method: ImpMIA利用神经网络的最大间隔隐式偏置理论，通过KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，找到梯度最能重构训练模型参数的样本。

Result: ImpMIA在现实设置中（仅有权重和训练数据超集可用）相比黑盒和白盒攻击都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 基于隐式偏置的白盒攻击方法ImpMIA在更现实的假设下显著提升了成员推理攻击的效果，为数据隐私保护提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集找到最优网络深度，减少模型大小和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常采用过深的架构，导致计算资源浪费、内存占用过大，在资源受限设备上部署困难。需要平衡模型深度与任务复杂度。

Method: 使用渐进深度扩展训练策略，从较浅深度开始训练，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加深度，直到达到目标精度，移除冗余层。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度分别减少98.64%和96.44%的内存占用，同时保持99.31%和96.08%的准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能有效为不同数据集找到最优网络深度，显著降低计算和内存成本，便于在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比率，有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的光谱特性。

Result: 在特定自然假设下，证明Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵驱动到单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，实现最优表示效率（η=1）。

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了EasyCore框架，通过样本的对抗脆弱性与训练中平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)的关联来选择核心集，仅保留低AIGN的简单样本进行训练，显著提升对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要针对干净准确率设计，在保持对抗鲁棒性方面表现不足。需要从数据中心的视角理解哪些输入样本对学习鲁棒特征最为关键。

Method: 将样本的对抗脆弱性与其硬度相关联，使用平均输入梯度范数(AIGN)量化硬度。提出EasyCore算法，仅选择AIGN值低的简单样本组成核心集进行训练。

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现了7%和5%的对抗准确率提升。

Conclusion: AIGN作为模型无关的数据集属性，使EasyCore成为一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，能够显著改善对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

TL;DR: 提出MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在恶劣光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态方法计算昂贵或产生结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏(MLCM-KD)框架，包含双向注入知识蒸馏(DIKD)机制，建立RGB和热成像模态间的连接，通过闭环监督强制学生学习与教师语义对齐的模态不变特征。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架成功解决了RGB到热成像知识转移中的模态差异问题，实现了既准确又高效的热成像面部关键点检测。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用更少的维度表示更多特征），使得攻击者可以利用特征间的干扰来生成对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对抗样本产生原因存在争议：要么认为是决策边界不规则性的产物，要么归因于对非鲁棒特征的敏感性。本文旨在从信息编码角度提供新的解释。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，在精确控制叠加的合成环境中研究对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中验证发现。

Result: 证明叠加现象足以产生对抗性漏洞，对抗扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测。解释了模型间攻击可转移性和类特定漏洞模式。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin
nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of
nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared
to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration,
pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light
efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present
an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several
times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration
framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a
lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion
algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced
distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures.
Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image
restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for
deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
(CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
environments.

Abstract: The integration of LLMs into software engineering has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from traditional rule-based systems to sophisticated agentic systems
capable of autonomous problem-solving. Despite this transformation, the field
lacks a comprehensive understanding of how benchmarks and solutions
interconnect, hindering systematic progress and evaluation. This survey
presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering,
bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We
analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy
spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based,
fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code
generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the
field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems
incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory
mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that
illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final
deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying
complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys
that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting
50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling
researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps and propose actionable future
directions, including multi-agent collaboration frameworks, self-evolving code
generation systems, and integration of formal verification with LLM-based
methods. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and
practitioners seeking to understand, evaluate, and advance LLM-empowered
software engineering systems.

### [413] [Operationalizing AI: Empirical Evidence on MLOps Practices, User Satisfaction, and Organizational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09968)
*Stefan Pasch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 基于对G2.com上8000多条AI开发平台用户评论的分析，研究发现7/9的MLOps实践与用户满意度显著正相关，表明MLOps实施为AI开发带来实际价值。组织规模影响MLOps讨论频率但不调节其与满意度的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLOps作为整合软件工程原则与ML生命周期管理的实践集合已出现，但关于这些实践是否以及如何支持用户开发和运营AI应用的实证证据仍然有限。

Method: 使用零样本分类分析G2.com上8000多条AI开发平台用户评论，测量用户对9种MLOps实践（包括CI/CD、工作流编排、可复现性、版本控制、协作和监控等）的情感倾向。

Result: 9种MLOps实践中有7种与用户满意度呈显著正相关关系。小型企业的评论者较少讨论某些MLOps实践，表明组织背景影响MLOps的普及度和显著性，但企业规模不调节MLOps与满意度的关系。

Conclusion: 有效的MLOps实施为AI开发带来实际价值。一旦应用，MLOps实践在不同组织环境中都被认为是普遍有益的，尽管组织背景会影响其讨论频率和显著性。

Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence
(AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability,
maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that
integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing
the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices
support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains
limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI
development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure
review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous
integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility,
versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a
significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that
effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development.
However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms
discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational
context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does
not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link. This indicates that once applied,
MLOps practices are perceived as universally beneficial across organizational
settings.

*Guan-Yan Yang,Tzu-Yu Cheng,Ya-Wen Teng,Farn Wanga,Kuo-Hui Yeh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ArtPerception是一个利用ASCII艺术绕过LLM安全防护的黑盒越狱框架，通过两阶段方法实现高效攻击，在多个主流LLM上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐主要关注语义解释，但对非标准数据表示（如ASCII艺术）的防御不足，存在安全漏洞。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段进行一次性模型预测试确定ASCII艺术识别最优参数；第二阶段利用这些参数发起高效的一次性恶意越狱攻击。提出了改进的Levenshtein距离(MLD)指标来评估LLM识别能力。

Result: 在四个最先进的开源LLM上展示了优越的越狱性能，成功迁移到GPT-4o、Claude Sonnet 3.7和DeepSeek-V3等商业模型，并能有效绕过LLaMA Guard和Azure内容过滤器等防御机制。

Conclusion: 真正的LLM安全需要防御多模态解释空间，即使在纯文本输入中也是如此，基于侦察的战略攻击非常有效。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications
has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security
challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic
interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data
representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box
jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the
security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that
rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic,
two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to
empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2
leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious
jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a
more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through
comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate
superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world
relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial
models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting
a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA
Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM
security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations,
even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic,
reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially
harmful and offensive model outputs.

TL;DR: SecPE是一种新颖的差分隐私合成文本生成框架，通过秘密感知保护机制，在保护敏感信息的同时显著提升数据效用并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的高质量文本数据往往涉及隐私问题而无法自由使用。现有的差分隐私合成文本生成方法采用统一保护策略，导致对非敏感内容的过度保护，造成显著的效用损失和计算开销。

Method: 提出Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE)框架，将私有进化与秘密感知保护相结合，满足(p,r)-秘密保护，这是高斯差分隐私的松弛形式，能够实现更紧密的效用-隐私权衡。

Result: 在OpenReview、PubMed和Yelp基准测试中，SecPE始终比基于GDP的Aug-PE基线方法获得更低的Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)和更高的下游任务准确率，同时需要更少的噪声来达到相同的保护水平。

Conclusion: 秘密感知保护机制能够实现更实用和有效的隐私保护合成文本生成，为隐私保护数据利用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and
even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text
in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns.
Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been
proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting
sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes
uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in
substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose
Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private
evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE
satisfies $(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a
relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs,
while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline
methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE
consistently achieves lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher
downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less
noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that
secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective
privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.

TL;DR: 研究发现基于推理的安全防护机制存在严重漏洞，简单的提示词模板操作就能成功绕过防护，导致有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于推理的安全防护机制在防御越狱攻击方面表现出色，但作者发现这些防护机制对输入提示的细微操作极其脆弱，一旦被绕过会产生更严重的安全风险。

Method: 提出了一系列越狱方法，包括白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置，从简单的模板操作到完全自动化的优化方法，涵盖多种攻击场景。

Result: 这些攻击方法在多个基准测试中实现了超过90%的攻击成功率，在本地模型和在线API服务上都表现出色，证实了这些漏洞的系统性。

Conclusion: 开源大型推理模型迫切需要更强的对齐技术来防止恶意滥用，当前基于推理的防护机制存在系统性安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs),
such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak
attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the
models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses.
The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and
will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the
jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense,
such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series.
Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be
extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once
hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover
a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template
tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful
guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we
introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based
guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range
from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along
with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve
alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different
benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API
services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that
these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估LVLM网页代理安全性的综合基准工具，包含6个模拟网页环境、2970个高质量轨迹，定义了6种攻击向量，并通过三层评估协议分析代理失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估基准覆盖范围有限，通常仅限于用户级提示操作等狭窄场景，无法捕捉代理的广泛漏洞，因此需要设计更全面的安全评估方法。

Method: 构建包含6个模拟网页环境的统一评估套件，定义6种攻击向量（用户级和环境级操作），采用三层评估协议分析内部推理、行为轨迹和任务结果。

Result: 对9个代表性LVLM进行大规模实验，结果显示所有测试代理都对细微的对抗性操作持续脆弱，并揭示了模型专业化与安全性之间的关键权衡。

Conclusion: 该基准工具为推进可信网页代理部署奠定了基础，提供了全面的基准套件和关于现代LVLM网页代理安全挑战的实证见解。

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful
tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world
environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of
security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial
coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt
manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic
benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first
introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic
web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes
2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The
suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both
user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a
multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three
critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task
outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple
success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9
representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose,
agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents
are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal
critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1)
a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered
evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of
modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing
trustworthy web agent deployment.

Motivation: 针对资源受限的物联网设备，需要轻量高效的实时多语言翻译系统，传统方法在模型大小和推理速度上无法满足部署需求。

Method: 采用算法-硬件协同设计，研究子字节精度量化（FP8、INT8、INT4、FP4），在FPGA加速器上部署，支持印度语言与国际语言的双向翻译。

Abstract: This paper introduces Bhasha-Rupantarika, a light and efficient multilingual
translation system tailored through algorithm-hardware codesign for
resource-limited settings. The method investigates model deployment at
sub-octet precision levels (FP8, INT8, INT4, and FP4), with experimental
results indicating a 4.1x reduction in model size (FP4) and a 4.2x speedup in
inference speed, which correlates with an increased throughput of 66 tokens/s

quantization for real-time deployment in IoT devices using FPGA accelerators,
achieving performance on par with expectations. Our evaluation covers
bidirectional translation between Indian and international languages,
showcasing its adaptability in low-resource linguistic contexts. The FPGA
deployment demonstrated a 1.96x reduction in LUTs and a 1.65x decrease in FFs,
resulting in a 2.2x enhancement in throughput compared to OPU and a 4.6x
enhancement compared to HPTA. Overall, the evaluation provides a viable
solution based on quantisation-aware translation along with hardware efficiency
suitable for deployable multilingual AI systems. The entire codes

TL;DR: 论文分析了X平台Community Notes系统的延迟问题，提出CrowdNotes+框架，利用LLM增强健康错误信息治理，通过分层评估和AI生成改善事实准确性和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Community Notes系统在健康相关笔记中存在显著延迟（中位延迟17.6小时），需要提高在错误信息激增时的响应能力。

Method: 提出CrowdNotes+统一框架，整合两种模式：基于证据的笔记增强和效用导向的笔记自动化，采用分层三步评估（相关性、正确性、帮助性）。

Result: 在15个LLM上的实验揭示了当前帮助性评估的漏洞（风格流畅性被误认为事实准确性），分层评估和LLM增强生成共同提高了事实精确性和证据效用。

Conclusion: 结果指向一种混合人机治理模型，能够同时提高众包事实核查的严谨性和及时性。

Abstract: Community Notes, the crowd-sourced misinformation governance system on X
(formerly Twitter), enables users to flag misleading posts, attach contextual
notes, and vote on their helpfulness. However, our analysis of 30.8K
health-related notes reveals significant latency, with a median delay of 17.6
hours before the first note receives a helpfulness status. To improve
responsiveness during real-world misinformation surges, we propose CrowdNotes+,
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance.
CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note
augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical
three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and
helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of
1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness
judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current
helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual
accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented
generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These
results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the
rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

TL;DR: CLoD-GS是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的连续细节层次框架，通过可学习的距离相关衰减参数实现单模型内的平滑质量缩放，消除了传统离散LoD方法的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散LoD方法需要存储多个模型副本，导致存储开销大，且在切换时会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，影响用户体验。新兴的3D高斯泼溅技术为连续LoD提供了更理想的解决方案。

Method: 在3DGS表示中集成连续LoD机制，为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，配合渲染点计数正则化。

Result: CLoD-GS从单一模型实现了平滑、质量可扩展的渲染，在广泛性能目标下提供高保真结果，同时减少了基元数量和内存占用。

Conclusion: CLoD-GS框架成功实现了连续细节层次管理，消除了传统离散方法的局限性，为实时计算机图形学提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

TL;DR: 提出VLM引导的自适应负提示方法，无需训练即可在推理时促进创造性图像生成，同时保持生成对象的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真场景，但难以产生真正新颖的内容。现有增强创造性的方法要么依赖图像特征插值限制探索范围，要么需要耗时的嵌入优化或模型微调。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型分析生成过程的中间输出，自适应地引导模型远离传统视觉概念，鼓励新颖和令人惊讶的输出出现。

Result: 在CLIP嵌入空间中使用统计指标评估创造性的新颖性和有效性，实验显示在创造性新颖性方面获得一致提升，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法无缝集成到现有扩散管道中，提供了一种实用途径来产生超越文本描述限制的创造性输出。

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前触觉传感器形状尺寸各异，导致模型通常绑定特定传感器设计，难以开发通用触觉表示。

Method: 1. Touch2Touch：端到端方法，利用配对数据直接生成跨传感器触觉图像
2. T2D2：构建中间深度表示，无需配对数据，实现Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch转换

Result: 在手持姿态估计和行为克隆等下游任务中验证了有效性，成功将在一个传感器上训练的模型迁移到另一个传感器。

Conclusion: 这两种方法为传感器转换提供了灵活解决方案，可根据数据可用性和应用需求选择合适方法，促进跨传感器模型重用。

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Motivation: 解决现有智能体部署后无法获取新知识来提升任务性能的根本限制。

Method: 使用经验反馈网络(EFN)自动识别上下文成功的先前动作经验，并基于检索到的指导条件化动作预测。采用强化学习与语义相似度奖励来确保预测动作与当前观察下的过去成功行为一致。

Result: 在多样化具身任务实验中，EFN显著提升了适应性、鲁棒性和成功率，优于冻结基线。

Conclusion: Dejavu框架为实现部署后持续优化行为的具身智能体提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Conclusion: 软提示方法能有效利用跨具身异构数据，X-VLA模型展现了在多样化机器人任务中的强大泛化能力

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B
instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep
of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities,
from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments,
and tasks. Website: https://thu-air-dream.github.io/X-VLA/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpikeGrasp是一个受神经启发的6-DoF抓取检测框架，直接处理来自立体脉冲相机的原始异步事件，无需重建点云，在杂乱和无纹理场景中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人抓取系统依赖将传感器数据转换为显式3D点云，这与生物智能的处理方式不同。本文探索一种根本不同的神经启发范式，模仿生物视觉运动通路。

Method: 引入SpikeGrasp框架，处理来自立体脉冲相机的原始异步事件，使用循环脉冲神经网络融合立体脉冲流，迭代优化抓取假设而不重建点云。

Result: 实验表明SpikeGrasp超越了传统的基于点云的基线方法，特别是在杂乱和无纹理场景中，并展示了显著的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过验证这种端到端神经启发方法的可行性，SpikeGrasp为未来能够实现自然界中流畅高效操作的系统铺平了道路，特别是对于动态物体。

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Conclusion: 该方法是通过仿真和扩散策略获取机器人铲取技能的有前景的途径

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

TL;DR: GLVC是一个基于生成式潜在模型的视频压缩框架，通过预训练的连续标记器将视频帧映射到感知对齐的潜在空间，从而在保持时间一致性的同时实现高效的感知视频压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感知优化的神经视频编解码器存在帧间质量波动导致的闪烁伪影问题，需要平衡率失真感知权衡。

Method: 使用预训练连续标记器将视频帧投影到感知对齐的潜在空间，重新设计潜在域编解码架构，引入统一帧内/帧间编码和循环记忆机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLVC在DISTS和LPIPS指标上达到最先进性能，用户研究表明其能以接近一半的码率媲美最新神经视频编解码器，同时保持稳定的时间一致性。

Conclusion: GLVC标志着向实用感知视频压缩迈出了重要一步，有效解决了闪烁伪影问题并实现了优异的率失真感知性能。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural
compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains
challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression,
where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural
video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by
the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video
Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression.
GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a
perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints
from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture
explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior
neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified
intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results
across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance
in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC
rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while
maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical
perceptual video compression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于紧凑人体先验和规范到目标变换的高效3D虚拟人编码框架，在超低码率下实现高质量3D虚拟人视频压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决3D虚拟人视频在元宇宙应用中需要高带宽的问题，通过分解外观和运动来最小化冗余，实现高效压缩。

Method: 使用无网络方式训练规范高斯虚拟人作为外观基础，同时采用人体先验模板通过紧凑参数表示捕捉时序身体运动。通过线性混合蒙皮变换将规范虚拟人变形为目标虚拟人。

Result: 在主流多视角人体视频数据集上，该方法在率失真性能上显著优于传统2D/3D编解码器和现有可学习动态3D高斯泼溅压缩方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为元宇宙应用中的无缝沉浸式多媒体体验铺平了道路，实现了超低码率下的高质量3D虚拟人视频压缩。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages
compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable
high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The
framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated
splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar
appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to
capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations.
This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy,
enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the
sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters,
consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal
bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming
canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating
temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting
compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream
multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive
multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique
for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However,
existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks
standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source
FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters.
Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for
a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression
efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and
encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally
lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is
merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a
robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and
efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source
implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何在其表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正理解逻辑而不仅仅是表面形式，为LLM的可解释性和形式分析提供新视角。

Method: 使用几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流动轨迹，通过自然演绎命题分离逻辑结构和语义，利用学习到的表示代理设计受控实验来可视化和量化推理流。

Result: 理论建立：(1) LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流动；(2) 逻辑语句作为这些流动速度的局部控制器。通过实验验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要。需要研究用户记忆对LLM情感智能的影响。

Method: 在人类验证的情感智能测试中评估了15个大型语言模型，使用相同的场景搭配不同的用户档案，分析情感解读的差异。

Result: 发现相同场景搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性不同的情感解读，多个高性能LLM中出现系统性偏见，优势群体获得更准确的情感理解。LLMs在情感理解和支持性建议任务中表现出显著的人口统计学差异。

Conclusion: 具有记忆增强功能的AI系统面临关键挑战：为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，个性化机制可能将社会等级嵌入模型的情感推理中。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学自动形式化中难以识别和利用先验数学知识的问题，传统检索方法因非正式陈述复杂且上下文有限而效果不佳。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为更易处理的子组件，从Mathlib等数学库中进行针对性前提检索，并检索示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在ProofNet、ConNF和MiniF2F-test基准测试中一致提升前提检索性能，ProofNet上F1分数相比DPR基线几乎翻倍，在分布外ConNF基准上BEq+@10指标分别提升37.14%(GPT-4.1)和42.25%(DeepSeek-V3.1)。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖于模型特定的知识边界，需要与各模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 解决AI代理在规划问题中面临的知识不确定性，通过如何做问题来填补知识空白，支持当前和未来任务的解决。

Method: 在Minecraft制作环境中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习代理从抽象化且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大。

Conclusion: How2为基于LLM的代理提供了一种通过交互环境中提问来持续提升规划能力的方法。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

### [439] [CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10095)
*Peiyuan Gong,Feiran Zhu,Yaqi Yin,Chenglei Dai,Chao Zhang,Kai Zheng,Wentian Bao,Jiaxin Mao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CardRewriter是一个基于LLM的查询重写框架，通过整合领域特定知识来解决短视频平台中长尾查询的匹配问题，显著提升了查询重写质量和检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台中用户查询（特别是长尾查询）存在拼写错误、表述不完整和意图模糊等问题，导致用户期望与检索结果不匹配。LLM在电商领域表现良好，但在短视频平台中因专有内容超出其训练分布而表现不佳。

Method: 提出CardRewriter框架，为每个查询聚合多源相关知识并总结为信息丰富的知识卡片，指导LLM更好地捕捉用户意图。采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后接组相对策略优化，并设计平衡查询相关性和检索效果的奖励系统。

Result: 离线实验显示CardRewriter显著提升了专有内容查询的重写质量。在线A/B测试证实了长观看率(LVR)和点击率(CTR)的显著提升，以及主动查询重构率(IQRR)的显著降低。自2025年9月起已在快手平台部署，服务数亿用户。

Conclusion: CardRewriter通过整合领域知识有效解决了短视频平台中长尾查询重写问题，在实际部署中取得了显著效果，证明了领域知识增强在LLM应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information
retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos.
However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling
errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches
between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they
struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short
videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside
their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce
\textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific
knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method
aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into
an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM
to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We
optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored
reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline
experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for
queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms
significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along
with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since
September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's
largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

### [440] [QDER: Query-Specific Document and Entity Representations for Multi-Vector Document Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11589)
*Shubham Chatterjee,Jeff Dalton*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: QDER是一个神经重排序模型，通过将知识图谱语义整合到多向量模型中，统一了实体导向和多向量方法。它采用"延迟聚合"策略，在最终评分阶段才进行聚合，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经信息检索方法分为两条路径：基于知识图谱的实体导向方法和捕捉细粒度语义的多向量模型。研究者希望统一这两种方法，整合知识图谱语义到多向量模型中。

Method: QDER的关键创新在于建模查询-文档关系：保持单个token和实体表示，仅在最终评分阶段进行聚合（延迟聚合）。首先通过学习的注意力模式转换这些细粒度表示，然后应用精心选择的数学运算进行精确匹配。

Result: 在五个标准基准测试中，QDER实现了显著的性能提升：在TREC Robust 2004上nDCG@20比最强基线提升了36%，在其他数据集上也有类似改进。在困难查询上表现尤为突出，达到nDCG@20=0.70，而传统方法完全失败（nDCG@20=0.0）。

Conclusion: QDER为实体感知检索的未来工作奠定了基础，证明了整合知识图谱语义到多向量模型中的有效性，特别是在处理困难查询方面表现出色。

Abstract: Neural IR has advanced through two distinct paths: entity-oriented approaches
leveraging knowledge graphs and multi-vector models capturing fine-grained
semantics. We introduce QDER, a neural re-ranking model that unifies these
approaches by integrating knowledge graph semantics into a multi-vector model.
QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships:
rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain
individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process,
performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call
"late aggregation." We first transform these fine-grained representations
through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical
operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks
show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36%
in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar
improvements on other datasets. QDER particularly excels on difficult queries,
achieving an nDCG@20 of 0.70 where traditional approaches fail completely
(nDCG@20 = 0.0), setting a foundation for future work in entity-aware
retrieval.

### [441] [REGENT: Relevance-Guided Attention for Entity-Aware Multi-Vector Neural Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11592)
*Shubham Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: REGENT是一个神经重排序模型，通过使用实体作为"语义骨架"来引导注意力，模仿人类理解方式，在三个挑战性数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经重排序模型在处理复杂信息需求和长文档时存在困难，主要问题在于智能内容选择——识别长文本中关键内容。人类自然围绕关键实体和概念构建理解，而神经模型在固定token窗口内处理文本，缺乏语义信号。

Method: REGENT将相关性指导直接集成到注意力机制中，结合细粒度词汇匹配和高层次语义推理。通过实体作为语义骨架来引导注意力，使模型能够聚焦概念重要内容，同时保持对精确术语匹配的敏感性。

Result: REGENT在三个挑战性数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，相比BM25提升高达108%，并持续优于包括ColBERT和RankVicuna在内的强基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功将实体语义直接集成到神经注意力中的工作，为实体感知信息检索建立了新范式。

Abstract: Current neural re-rankers often struggle with complex information needs and
long, content-rich documents. The fundamental issue is not computational--it is
intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy,
multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around
key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token
windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical
semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics
human-like understanding by using entities as a "semantic skeleton" to guide
attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention
mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic
reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on
conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term
matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging
datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently
outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to successfully integrate entity semantics
directly into neural attention, establishing a new paradigm for entity-aware
information retrieval.

### [442] [FinVet: A Collaborative Framework of RAG and External Fact-Checking Agents for Financial Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11654)
*Daniel Berhane Araya,Duoduo Liao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinVet是一个多智能体框架，通过集成两个RAG管道和外部事实核查，采用置信度加权投票机制，为金融市场提供透明、可溯源的信息验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场面临错误信息的严重威胁，现有方法缺乏决策透明度且溯源能力有限，需要开发更可靠的验证系统。

Method: 采用自适应三层处理策略，根据检索置信度动态调整验证方式：从元数据提取到混合推理再到完整模型分析，结合置信度加权投票机制。

Result: 在FinFact数据集上，FinVet达到0.85的F1分数，比最佳单个管道提升10.4%，比独立RAG方法提升37%。

Conclusion: FinVet通过多智能体框架和自适应处理策略，显著提升了信息验证的准确性和透明度，为金融市场提供了可靠的错误信息检测方案。

Abstract: Financial markets face growing threats from misinformation that can trigger
billions in losses in minutes. Most existing approaches lack transparency in
their decision-making and provide limited attribution to credible sources. We
introduce FinVet, a novel multi-agent framework that integrates two
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with external fact-checking
through a confidence-weighted voting mechanism. FinVet employs adaptive
three-tier processing that dynamically adjusts verification strategies based on
retrieval confidence, from direct metadata extraction to hybrid reasoning to
full model-based analysis. Unlike existing methods, FinVet provides
evidence-backed verdicts, source attribution, confidence scores, and explicit
uncertainty flags when evidence is insufficient. Experimental evaluation on the
FinFact dataset shows that FinVet achieves an F1 score of 0.85, which is a
10.4% improvement over the best individual pipeline (fact-check pipeline) and
37% improvement over standalone RAG approaches.

### [443] [MTMD: A Multi-Task Multi-Domain Framework for Unified Ad Lightweight Ranking at Pinterest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09857)
*Xiao Yang,Peifeng Yin,Abe Engle,Jinfeng Zhuang,Ling Leng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种多任务多领域（MTMD）架构，用于轻量级广告排序层的联合优化，通过混合专家网络和领域适应模块实现跨领域知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决广告推荐系统中多任务、多领域联合优化的挑战，包括不同优化目标（CTR、CVR）、不同展示场景和广告产品的统一建模问题。

Method: 基于双塔架构的多任务多领域框架，采用混合专家网络学习领域专业知识和共享知识，引入领域适应模块促进知识迁移，约束不同预测任务的建模。

Result: 离线损失值降低12%-36%，对应在线点击成本降低2%，已部署到生产环境替代9个生产模型。

Conclusion: MTMD框架成功实现了多任务多领域的联合优化，显著提升了广告推荐系统的性能，证明了该方法的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before
the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad
recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization
tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads
and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces
where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with
diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging
problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight
ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's
value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple
goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization
goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different
surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn
domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains
to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture
under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1)
handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a
unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn
both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between
domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer
between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD
improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction
in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production
for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

### [444] [The Social Cost of Intelligence: Emergence, Propagation, and Amplification of Stereotypical Bias in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10943)
*Thi-Nhung Nguyen,Linhao Luo,Thuy-Trang Vu,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多智能体系统中大语言模型的偏见问题，发现在多智能体协作环境下偏见更容易出现和传播，但通过合作和辩论式通信可以减轻偏见放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的兴起，多个LLM协作和通信引入了偏见出现和传播的新动态，而先前研究主要关注单个模型，因此需要探索多智能体系统中的偏见问题。

Method: 通过模拟社交环境，让智能体代表不同社会群体，在各种交互和对抗场景下评估系统行为，并在三个偏见基准测试上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现多智能体系统通常比单智能体系统更不稳健，偏见往往通过群体内偏袒早期出现，但合作和辩论式通信可以减轻偏见放大，更稳健的基础LLM能提高系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了影响多智能体LLM系统公平性和韧性的关键因素，为构建更公平的多智能体系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,
manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While
prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of
multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,
introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and
propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical
bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and
inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and
amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different
social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and
adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are
generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early
through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based
communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying
LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors
shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: MASSE是首个用于结构工程的多智能体系统，通过集成基于大语言模型的智能体与真实工程工作流，实现了结构工程任务的自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构工程作为基础但传统停滞的领域，核心工作流几十年未变，尽管其经济影响巨大。大语言模型在复杂推理、长期规划和精确工具使用方面的进步与结构工程任务高度契合。

Method: 采用无需训练的基于LLM的多智能体系统，能够自动执行设计规范解读、荷载计算和结构承载力验证等任务。

Result: 在真实案例研究中，MASSE将专家工作量从约2小时减少到几分钟，同时在实用工程场景中提高了可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: MASSE证明了大多数真实世界结构工程工作流可以通过LLM多智能体系统完全自动化，并可在专业环境中立即部署。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural
Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents
with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental
yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely
unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market
size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to
perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization
-- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as
interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying
structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most
real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a
training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment
in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world
case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately
two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in
practical engineering scenarios.

TL;DR: VCB Bench是一个高质量的中文语音对话基准测试，完全基于真实人类语音，从指令遵循、知识理解和鲁棒性三个维度评估大型音频语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要局限于英语、依赖合成语音，且缺乏多维度综合评估，因此需要构建一个基于真实人类语音的中文基准测试。

Method: 构建VCB Bench基准，从三个互补维度评估LALMs：指令遵循（包括语音级控制）、知识理解（通用知识、推理和日常对话）和鲁棒性（内容、环境和说话人特征的扰动稳定性）。

Result: 对代表性LALMs的实验揭示了显著的性能差距，并指出了未来的改进方向。

Conclusion: VCB Bench提供了一个可复现的细粒度评估框架，为推进中文语音对话模型提供了标准化方法和实践见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced
multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited
-- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack
comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address
these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality
Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates
LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including
speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general
knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under
perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on
representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future
directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained
evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights
for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Diffusion-Link是一种基于扩散的模态桥接模块，通过生成式映射将音频嵌入转换为文本嵌入分布，有效减小音频-文本模态差距，在自动音频描述任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比音频-语言预训练虽然能产生强大的联合表示，但持续的音频-文本模态差距限制了多模态编码器与大型语言模型耦合的效益。

Method: 提出Diffusion-Link扩散模块，在冻结多模态编码器的输出嵌入上进行训练，实现为具有三个残差MLP块的轻量级网络，将音频嵌入生成式映射到文本嵌入分布。

Result: 在模态差距分析中，Diffusion-Link在相似性和几何标准上最大程度减小了模态差距；在自动音频描述任务中，在AudioCaps数据集上实现了零样本和全监督描述的最先进性能，相对增益分别达到52.5%和7.5%。

Conclusion: 缩小模态差距对于多模态编码器与LLMs的有效耦合至关重要，基于扩散的模态桥接为超越知识检索中心设计提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Contrastive audio-language pretraining yields powerful joint representations,
yet a persistent audio-text modality gap limits the benefits of coupling
multimodal encoders with large language models (LLMs). We present
Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively
maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is
trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and
implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess
the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on
Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first
application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results.
(1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link
reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows
a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2)
Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline
achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised
captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and
7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is
pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and
diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond
knowledge-retrieval-centric designs. Code will be released upon acceptance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声模拟方法计算成本高昂，基于卷积的替代方法仍然较慢，需要几分钟才能生成完整B模式图像，需要更高效的模拟方案。

Method: 使用概率射线追踪框架，将组织表示为散射概率和散射幅度的体积场，通过自由飞行delta追踪模拟射线相互作用，结合平面波成像和波束成形技术。

Result: 验证实验显示能够产生真实的散斑和包含物模式，在几秒内生成B模式图像，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: UltraScatter为基于波的超声模拟方法提供了一个可扩展的替代方案，在保持真实性的同时大幅提高了计算速度。

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically,
achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster
alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain
relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode
image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that
models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is
represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering
amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking.
Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information
incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave
imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces
B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic
speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable
alternative to wave-based methods.
