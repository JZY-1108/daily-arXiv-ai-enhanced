### [1] [Fair Play in the Newsroom: Actor-Based Filtering Gender Discrimination in Text Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13169)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展的actor-level pipeline，用于检测和缓解大规模文本语料库中的性别歧视问题，通过新的指标捕捉情感、句法代理和引用风格的不对称性，并在德国报纸语料库上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出往往反映训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要开发更有效的检测和缓解方法来构建更公平的语料库。

Method: 扩展的actor-level pipeline，引入新的actor-level指标（情感不对称、句法代理不对称、引用风格不对称），支持诊断性语料分析和基于排除的平衡方法。

Result: 在taz2024full德语报纸语料库（1980-2024）上应用，在多个语言维度上实现了显著的性别平衡改进，但更微妙的情感偏见和框架偏见仍然存在。

Conclusion: 虽然表面层面的不对称可以通过过滤和重新平衡来缓解，但更微妙的偏见形式仍然存在，需要进一步研究基于话语的公平性审计和公平语料库构建。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

### [2] [MM-BrowseComp: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13186)
*Shilong Li,Xingyuan Bu,Wenjie Wang,Jiaheng Liu,Jun Dong,Haoyang He,Hao Lu,Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Zhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Jiayi Tian,Chenchen Zhang,Tianhao Peng,Yancheng He,Jihao Gu,Yuanxing Zhang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Wangchunshu Zhou,Zhaoxiang Zhang,Ruizhe Ding,Shilei Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网页浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理在多模态检索和推理方面的能力。现有模型在此基准上表现不佳，最高准确率仅为29.02%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页浏览基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容（图像、视频等），因此需要一个新的基准来评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力。

Method: 研究人员创建了MM-BrowseComp基准，包含224个具有挑战性的手工制作问题，这些问题在提示中经常包含图像，并且网页上的关键信息可能嵌入在图像或视频中。为每个问题提供了验证清单，用于细粒度分析多模态依赖关系和推理路径。

Result: 对最先进模型的综合评估显示，即使是像OpenAI o3这样的顶级模型，在使用工具的情况下也只能达到29.02%的准确率，这表明当前模型的多模态能力不足，缺乏原生的多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp基准突显了当前AI代理在多模态网页浏览方面的局限性，强调了开发具有更强多模态理解和推理能力的模型的必要性。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

### [3] [Overcoming Latency Bottlenecks in On-Device Speech Translation: A Cascaded Approach with Alignment-Based Streaming MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13358)
*Zeeshan Ahmed,Frank Seide,Niko Moritz,Ju Lin,Ruiming Xie,Simone Merello,Zhe Liu,Christian Fuegen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种实时流式语音翻译方法，有效平衡翻译质量和延迟，通过ASR和MT的高效集成，利用语言线索和beam-search剪枝技术，在设备端双语对话翻译中实现低延迟高质量表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时设备端流式语音翻译中ASR和MT集成的挑战，特别是如何在保持实时性的同时缩小与非流式翻译系统的质量差距

Method: 采用同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索管理上下文，使用time-out和forced finalization等高效的beam-search剪枝技术来维持系统实时性

Result: 提出的技术在延迟和质量方面均优于基线方法，显著缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确高效的实时语音翻译铺平了道路，证明了在设备端实现高质量流式语音翻译的可行性

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

### [4] [Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13365)
*Dylan Phelps,Rodrigo Wilkens,Edward Gow-Smith,Thomas Pickard,Maggie Mi,Aline Villavicencio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理能力对大型语言模型在习语检测任务中的影响，发现推理对性能的提升效果比预期小且多变，大模型能更好理解习语含义，而小模型通过提供定义提示可改善表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型的发展，大型语言模型在需要逻辑步骤的任务上表现提升。习语检测作为需要先理解再消歧的语言任务，可能受益于推理能力的增强，因此研究推理能力对习语检测性能的影响。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上进行评估，分析思维链推理对模型性能的影响，并对小模型提供定义提示进行实验。

Result: 推理效果比预期小且多变：小模型通过思维链推理可从数学调优中间模型提升性能，但达不到基础模型水平；大模型（14B、32B、70B）显示适度改进。大模型能准确生成习语定义，小模型常失败。为小模型提供定义提示可在某些情况下改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型大小对习语理解能力有显著影响，大模型展现出更好的习语理解能力，而小模型通过外部知识辅助（如提供定义）可以部分弥补这一缺陷，推理能力对习语检测的提升效果有限且依赖模型规模。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

### [5] [Whispering Context: Distilling Syntax and Semantics for Long Speech Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13376)
*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过从LLaMA模型中提取上下文知识来增强Whisper ASR系统，在长音频转录中显著提升了词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点符号的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中经常难以保持句法和语义准确性，这影响了命名实体识别、大小写和标点等下游任务的表现。

Method: 使用两种策略：(1) 通过最优传输进行标记级蒸馏以对齐维度和序列长度；(2) 最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入之间的表示损失，融合句法和语义信息。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上的评估显示，词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点成功率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了将语言上下文整合到转录中的价值，为长语音中稳健、上下文感知的ASR系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

### [6] [Datarus-R1: An Adaptive Multi-Step Reasoning LLM for Automated Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13382)
*Ayoub Ben Chaliah,Hela Dellagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。该模型采用轨迹式训练方法，结合双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个定量领域基准测试中表现优异，准确率提升30%，同时减少18-49%的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗余循环和推理效率低下的问题，通过轨迹式训练和双奖励机制提升模型的分析能力和推理质量。

Method: 1) 轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架（轻量级结构信号+分层奖励模型）；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现；4) 余弦课程学习从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度；5) 双推理接口（代理模式和反思模式）。

Result: 在标准公共基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到甚至超过QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上准确率提升30%，每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出。

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双奖励优化机制，成功解决了RL对齐LLM的常见问题，实现了高效、准确的研究生级别问题求解能力，为复杂数据分析任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

### [7] [ALIGN: Word Association Learning for Cross-Cultural Generalization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13426)
*Chunhua Liu,Kabir Manandhar Shrestha,Sukai Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过参数高效微调方法，使用母语者的自由词汇联想规范来改善大语言模型的文化对齐问题，在英语和中文上均取得显著效果，小模型性能可媲美大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在跨文化交流中仍反映预训练语料库中的分布偏差，缺乏有效的文化对齐方法，需要探索基于人类认知的有效学习途径。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT使英语P@5提升16-20%，中文提升43-165%，中位具体性提高+0.20，达到人类水平的情感效价和唤醒度。在世界价值观调查中，微调模型答案分布向目标文化偏移，中文对齐响应翻倍，美国偏见下降三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究表明几百万个基于文化的联想足以实现价值对齐，无需昂贵的重新训练，7-8B模型性能可媲美70B基线模型，凸显了基于人类认知的文化对齐研究的重要性和前景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

### [8] [ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514)
*Hongxin Ding,Baixiang Huang,Yue Fang,Weibin Liao,Xinke Jiang,Zheng Li,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励机制，让医疗大语言模型从被动回答转向主动提问，显著提升医疗诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动询问的能力，这在需要交互式信息收集的真实临床场景中存在误诊风险。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1)SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量交互轨迹；2)SIG增强的策略优化结合新颖的奖励分配机制，针对性地优化信息量大的问题。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM从被动范式转变为主动范式，通过强化学习和Shapley信息增益奖励机制，显著提升了模型在交互式医疗咨询中的临床价值。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

### [9] [Saudi-Dialect-ALLaM: LoRA Fine-Tuning for Dialectal Arabic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13525)
*Hassan Barmandah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过LoRA微调技术提升阿拉伯语大模型对沙特方言（纳吉迪和希贾兹方言）的支持能力，使用方言标签训练的方法显著提高了方言生成准确率和文本保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前阿拉伯语大语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言的支持不足，这限制了模型捕捉真实方言变化的能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集（5,466对合成指令-响应），对ALLaM-7B-Instruct模型进行LoRA微调，比较了带方言标签训练和无标签训练两种变体

Result: 带方言标签训练的模型效果最佳，将沙特方言率从47.97%提升至84.21%，MSA泄露从32.63%降至6.21%，文本保真度指标也有显著提升

Conclusion: LoRA微调方法在沙特方言生成任务上优于多个通用指令模型，提供了有效的方言控制能力，同时避免了基线模型常见的元数据标签重复问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

*Chalamalasetti Kranti,Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATA是一个新的泰卢固语评估数据集，包含729个选择题和开放式问题，用于评估大语言模型在泰卢固语中的能力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在低资源语言（泰卢固语）中的真实能力，理解模型局限性，为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供信息。

Method: 创建包含729个问题的评估数据集，涵盖多种语言维度；评估11个开源和闭源大语言模型；分析模型在选择题中依赖表面启发式（如答案位置和干扰项模式）的行为；比较LLM作为评判者与人工评估在开放式问题中的表现。

Result: 对大语言模型在泰卢固语中的性能进行了细粒度分析；实证显示模型在选择题中依赖表面启发式策略；比较了LLM评判与人工评估在低资源语言中的可靠性差异。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供信息，同时为未来泰卢固语NLP研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

### [11] [Compressed Models are NOT Trust-equivalent to Their Large Counterparts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13533)
*Rohit Raj Rai,Chirag Kothari,Siddhesh Shelke,Amit Awekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 压缩模型在准确率接近原始大模型时，仍然存在可解释性对齐和校准相似性的显著差异，不能完全信任其预测结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能对等并不保证信任对等，需要评估压缩模型是否与原始大模型具有相同的可信度

Method: 提出二维信任对等评估框架：1）可解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）2）校准相似性（使用ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图）

Result: 实验发现压缩模型与原始BERT-base模型在可解释性对齐度低，校准相似性存在显著不匹配，即使准确率几乎相同

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能作为大模型的直接替代品，部署时需要超越性能对等的谨慎评估

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 医疗领域LLM解码策略研究：确定性方法（如beam search）优于随机采样，大模型质量更高但推理时间更长，医疗专用模型在部分任务表现更好但对解码策略更敏感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域准确性至关重要的背景下，探索不同解码策略对LLM输出质量的影响，目前这方面的研究还不够充分

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）中评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同尺寸模型

Result: 确定性策略普遍优于随机策略，beam search得分最高；大模型整体得分更高但推理时间更长；医疗LLM在2个任务中表现更好但对解码选择更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异

Conclusion: 医疗应用中需要谨慎选择解码方法，其影响力有时甚至超过模型选择本身

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨语音大语言模型（Speech-LLMs）是否存在类似文本LLMs的性别偏见，通过分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话人分配来检测系统性偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语音LLMs表现出与文本LLMs相似的涌现能力和上下文意识，但其在性别偏见方面的表现仍是一个未解问题。研究者希望了解语音模型是否也会编码和体现社会性别刻板印象

Method: 使用说话人分配作为偏见分析工具，构建两个数据集：包含性别刻板印象职业的"职业"数据集和具有性别含义的"性别色彩词汇"数据集，评估Bark TTS模型的默认说话人选择模式

Result: Bark模型没有表现出系统性偏见，但显示出性别意识并存在一定的性别倾向性

Conclusion: 语音LLMs虽然具有性别意识，但不像文本模型那样编码隐式性别关联，说话人选择提供了研究语音模型偏见的明确线索

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源语言和特定领域的文档VQA提供了可扩展的基础解决方案，每个组件都做出了有意义的贡献。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective
document segmentation, an intelligent data augmentation pipeline that
automatically generates high-quality reasoning question-answer pairs with
multi-level verification, and adaptive ensemble inference with dynamic
configuration generation and early stopping mechanisms. Experiments on Japanese
document VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements with 83.04\%
accuracy on Yes/No questions, 52.66\% on factual questions, and 44.12\% on
numerical questions in JDocQA, and 59\% accuracy on LAVA dataset. Ablation
studies confirm meaningful contributions from each component, and our framework
establishes new state-of-the-art results for Japanese document VQA while
providing a scalable foundation for other low-resource languages and
specialized domains. Our code available at:

*Tomer Ashuach,Dana Arad,Aaron Mueller,Martin Tutek,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器(SAE)的参数高效方法，用于实现持久性概念遗忘，通过自动识别并抑制多层SAE特征来移除有害知识，同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性地移除不需要的知识同时保持模型效用。现有SAE方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP自动识别多个层中的显著SAE特征并抑制其激活，实现参数高效的持久概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个LLM上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标概念与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级持久遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，为模型安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试中的表现，发现当前最先进模型仅达到57.74%的准确率，远低于人类平均水平66.54%和最佳表现99.60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在低资源语言（越南语）多模态教育内容上的表现，验证主要基于英语数据训练的模型是否能处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 构建包含2,548个多模态问题的ViExam基准测试，涵盖7个学术领域，测试多种VLMs的性能，并尝试跨语言提示和人类协作方法。

Result: SOTA VLMs平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%，仅o3思考模型(74.07%)超过人类平均水平。跨语言提示反而降低性能1个百分点，人类协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不佳，跨语言迁移能力有限，需要针对低资源语言开发更有效的多模态模型。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估28个大语言模型在20种可废止推理模式中的表现，发现前沿模型处理默认推理较好但性能差异大，思维链提示反而导致性能下降，多数模型难以区分可废止推理和演绎推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型处理泛型概括（如'鸟会飞'）的可废止推理能力，这对非单调逻辑、默认推理、认知和概念获取具有重要意义。

Method: 使用20种可废止推理模式测试28个LLM，比较零样本、少样本和思维链提示的效果，分析模型对泛型陈述的理解和推理能力。

Result: 前沿模型处理默认推理问题表现良好但差异显著，少样本提示略有改善，思维链提示导致平均准确率下降11.14%，多数模型混淆可废止推理与演绎推理或将泛型误解为全称陈述。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也存在明显局限，需要改进对泛型陈述的理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

*Hanna Herasimchyk,Alhassan Abdelhalim,Sören Laue,Michaela Regneri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了通过预测准确性来判断词嵌入中语义知识编码的假设，证明即使随机信息也能被成功预测，表明现有方法主要反映向量空间几何相似性而非真正的语义属性涌现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐含编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要，但现有方法假设预测语义特征的准确性意味着词嵌入包含相应知识，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 通过分析常见词嵌入解释方法，特别是将词嵌入映射到人类可解释语义特征（特征规范）的方法，并测试这些方法预测随机信息的能力。

Result: 研究发现预测准确性并不能可靠指示真正的基于特征的可解释性，这些方法甚至能成功预测随机信息，结果主要由算法上限决定而非词嵌入中有意义的语义表示。

Conclusion: 基于预测性能的数据集比较不可靠，此类映射主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，不能表明语义属性的真正涌现，需要更可靠的方法来评估词嵌入中的知识编码。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

TL;DR: EEG-MedRAG是一个基于超图的三层检索增强生成框架，用于统一EEG领域知识、患者病例和大规模存储库，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着脑电图(EEG)在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战。

Method: 提出三层超图框架，将EEG领域知识、个体患者病例和大规模存储库统一为可遍历的n元关系超图，支持联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。

Result: 实验表明EEG-MedRAG在答案准确性和检索性能上显著优于TimeRAG和HyperGraphRAG，显示出在真实临床决策支持中的强大潜力。

Conclusion: EEG-MedRAG框架为EEG数据的高效检索和语义解释提供了有效解决方案，并建立了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床QA基准，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

### [20] [Sycophancy under Pressure: Evaluating and Mitigating Sycophantic Bias via Adversarial Dialogues in Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13743)
*Kaiwei Zhang,Qi Jia,Zijian Chen,Wei Sun,Xiangyang Zhu,Chunyi Li,Dandan Zhu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在科学问答中的奉承行为（sycophancy），即模型倾向于迎合用户信念而忽略事实准确性。作者提出了评估框架和Pressure-Tune方法来增强模型的抗奉承能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要事实严谨性的领域中经常表现出奉承行为，这种倾向在高风险的科学问答环境中尤其危险，可能影响协作推理、决策制定和知识形成，但目前这一现象在事实问答环境中研究不足。

Method: 提出了统一的评估框架来量化奉承性语境对模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和针对性指标（如误导抵抗和奉承抵抗）。同时提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话上进行轻量级微调，配以思维链推理来拒绝用户错误信息。

Result: 系统评估显示开源和专有模型普遍存在奉承倾向，这种倾向更多由对齐策略而非模型大小驱动。Pressure-Tune方法在具有挑战性的科学问答基准测试中显著增强了奉承抵抗能力，且不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应性。

Conclusion: Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的方法来实现更真实和有原则的模型行为，通过后训练方法有效减轻了语言模型在科学问答中的奉承问题，为提升模型事实一致性提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一种基于频域分析的机器生成文本检测方法，通过低频域过滤和动态频谱对齐策略，在跨域泛化场景中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在相同领域训练测试时表现良好，但在面对领域偏移时泛化能力差，需要解决跨域检测问题

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现机器生成文本与人类写作文本在频谱上存在显著差异。设计低频域过滤模块过滤对领域偏移敏感的文档级特征，采用动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变的特征

Result: 在3种领域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism通过频域特征提取和领域不变特征学习，有效提升了跨域检测性能

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的文本在模仿儿童语言方面存在显著差异，包括文本更长但词汇丰富度更低、过度依赖高频词、名词使用不足等问题，即使使用few-shot提示也只能略微改善相似度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型是否能够生成类似儿童的语言，特别是在教育应用中，因为目前很少关注LLM生成文本与儿童语言的相似性

Method: 使用德国儿童图片故事描述语料库，通过零样本和少样本提示生成LLM文本，从心理语言学角度比较词汇频率、词汇丰富度、句子长度、词性标注和语义相似度等多个维度

Result: LLM生成的文本比儿童文本更长但词汇丰富度更低，更多使用高频词，名词代表性不足，语义向量空间分析显示相似度很低，few-shot提示只能略微提高相似度但仍无法复制词汇和语义模式

Conclusion: LLM在通过多模态提示（文本+图像）近似儿童语言方面存在局限，这对心理语言学研究和教育应用具有重要意义，同时引发了关于LLM生成语言在儿童教育工具中适用性的重要问题

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过追溯证据来源让用户评估摘要准确性。

Method: 1) 标注500篇医学摘要的7个关键方面；2) 提出包含4个指标的细粒度评估框架；3) 设计Track-Then-Sum摘要流水线作为基线方法。

Result: 实验表明TracSum可作为有效的基准，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，包含完整上下文能进一步提升完整性。

Conclusion: TracSum基准和评估框架为可追溯的基于方面的摘要任务提供了有效解决方案，追踪机制和完整上下文对提升医学摘要质量至关重要。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过贝叶斯方法评估了主流大语言模型在道德维度理解方面与人类的对比，发现AI模型表现优于75%的人类标注者，特别是在减少假阴性方面表现出更强的道德敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多使用确定性标注方法，无法捕捉人类标注者的分歧和不确定性。本研究旨在通过建模标注者分歧来更准确地评估语言模型在道德理解方面的表现。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，处理了100万+模型查询，使用25万+标注数据（来自约700名标注者对10万+文本的标注），评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级模型。

Result: AI模型通常排名前25%的人类标注者，平衡准确率远高于平均水平。AI产生的假阴性远少于人类，显示出更强的道德检测敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在道德维度理解方面表现出色，不仅达到人类优秀水平，在某些方面（如减少假阴性）甚至超越人类表现，为AI道德评估提供了新的方法论框架。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于提示词的one-shot策略，通过添加倒计时标记和明确计数规则，让现成LLM能够精确生成指定数量的token，无需微调或迭代采样


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制LLM生成文本长度具有挑战性，模型经常超出或达不到显式长度指令，因为它们无法可靠地保持内部token计数

Method: 在提示词中附加倒计时标记和明确计数规则，让模型在生成时同时进行计数，实现"边写边数"

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI上，GPT-4.1的严格长度符合率从低于30%提升到95%以上，超过了流行的草稿-修订基线方法，同时保持了答案质量

Conclusion: 仅通过提示工程就能实现精确的长度控制，为训练或解码方法提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

Motivation: 自然语言生成评估是AI实际应用的关键挑战，虽然人工评估是金标准但成本高且难以扩展，自动评估指标不断发展但缺乏统一标准，需要系统分析现有方法的有效性

Method: 对现有自动评估指标进行全面检查，包括方法学、文档化优势限制、验证方法以及与人工评估的相关性分析，特别关注最新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务评估

Result: 发现指标通常只捕捉文本质量的特定方面，有效性因任务和数据集而异，验证实践缺乏结构化，与人工评估的相关性不一致，这些挑战在最新指标中仍然存在

Conclusion: 挑战了寻找'完美指标'的追求，建议基于任务特定需求选择指标，采用互补评估方法，新指标应专注于改进验证方法学

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

*Jiacheng Ruan,Dan Jiang,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu,Yangyang Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型在科学领域的综合性评估基准，解决了现有基准在多语言推理、模态覆盖和细粒度知识标注方面的不足，包含1019个高质量问答对，覆盖4个学科和5种语言，实验表明该基准对现有模型具有较高挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域评估基准存在三个关键挑战：1）多语言场景下模型推理能力评估不足；2）对MLLMs综合模态覆盖评估不充分；3）缺乏科学知识点的细粒度标注。需要构建更全面的评估体系来准确衡量模型能力。

Method: 收集了1,019个高质量问答对，涉及3种评估模式，覆盖数学、物理、化学、生物四个学科，支持中文、英文、法文、西班牙文和日文五种语言。在16个开源模型和4个闭源模型上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性。在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学和生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。通过多语言和细粒度知识属性深入分析了模型性能。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，能够有效评估多模态大语言模型在科学领域的推理能力，特别是在多语言和细粒度知识理解方面，有助于识别模型在特定领域的弱点，推动模型性能的进一步提升。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Result: 在HotelRec数据集上，ReviewGraph性能与大语言模型相当，优于传统NLP基线方法（词袋、TF-IDF、Word2Vec），在Cohen's Kappa等一致性指标上表现优异，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 基于图的表示方法在评论分析中具有潜力，提供了更好的可解释性和可视化探索能力，为未来集成图神经网络和微调LLM提取方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Result: 显著提高了偏好数据对的多样性和质量，在长文本推理基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架有效解决了长文本建模中的数据质量问题，为提升LLM长文本能力提供了新思路

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，显著提升了Pass@k性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在提高Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，从而降低生成多样性并限制Pass@k性能的上限。

Method: 提出在线自对弈变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，同时保持参考答案不变，有效维持训练过程中的策略熵。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在3B到32B不同规模模型的12个推理基准上均表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SvS策略通过维持策略熵有效解决了RLVR训练中的多样性下降问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

TL;DR: 该论文发现LLM在代理任务微调后安全性下降，提出PING方法通过自然语言前缀注入来增强安全性，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在演变为代理系统时，微调过程经常忽视安全性问题，导致模型更容易执行有害任务并减少拒绝倾向。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，通过迭代生成和选择自然语言前缀，引导模型拒绝有害请求同时保持良性任务性能。

Result: 实验表明PING显著提升了微调LLM代理的安全性，在网页导航和代码生成任务中均优于现有提示方法。

Conclusion: 前缀标记对行为修改至关重要，PING为LLM代理安全提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Motivation: 数字健康分析面临专家知识稀缺、数据短缺和隐私限制等挑战，特别是在分析包含复杂情感和医疗背景的患者生成内容时，传统机器学习方法受限。

Method: 开发结构化编码本系统编码专家解读指南，通过针对性提示而非大量训练，让LLMs应用领域特定知识。使用6个GPT模型与DeepSeek、LLaMA 3.1进行比较，并与预训练语言模型和词典方法对比，基于400个专家标注的OHC帖子。

Conclusion: 通过上下文学习支持的跨不同LLM模型的一致性能，为数字健康分析提供了有前景的解决方案，解决了数字健康研究中专家知识短缺的关键挑战。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Motivation: 现有生理和车辆动力学方法具有侵入性且硬件依赖，视觉方法存在小目标检测困难和多尺度特征建模不足的问题，需要开发非侵入式、高效的实时疲劳检测方案

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含卷积注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息改善空间定位

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型，消融实验验证模块有效性

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据集成和嵌入式优化

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在OCR任务中存在幻觉问题，且相比专门训练的专家模型效果较差。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势，提高识别准确性

Method: 提出推理和工具交织的训练框架：模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并推理得出最终识别结果

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，通过结合专家模型的优势以较低成本提升了性能，为文档图像解析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升了CNN和Transformer的性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny在LIMUC上达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略在标签不确定性下能有效改善有序分类性能，具有重要应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据集缺乏和隐私保护下多样化样本收集困难的问题，需要一种能够生成高质量、可控且保护隐私的步态数据的方法。

Method: 使用视频扩散模型在步态轮廓数据上从头训练，生成时间一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件控制，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 将GaitCrafter生成的合成样本融入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份数据具有独特一致的步态模式，可用于模型训练同时保护真实主体隐私。

Conclusion: 该研究在利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且隐私感知的步态数据生成方面迈出了重要一步，为步态识别领域提供了有效的数据增强和隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在仅保留10%视觉token的情况下实现6.4倍加速和13.4%的计算量，性能仅下降3%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时产生大量视觉token，导致二次复杂度的自注意力机制带来巨大计算开销和延迟，阻碍实际部署

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）基于下游驾驶任务重要性学习每个摄像头视图最优剪枝比率的视图自适应剪枝控制器

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1上，Prune2Drive在保持或提升任务性能的同时实现了显著加速和内存节省。仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段加速6.4倍，计算量降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%

Conclusion: Prune2Drive提供了一种无需模型重训练或注意力图访问的高效视觉token剪枝解决方案，适用于现代高效注意力实现，为自动驾驶视觉语言模型的实际部署提供了可行路径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚如何有效利用Lp约束攻击的见解来提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架：每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用强基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部整形手术效果评估缺乏客观、量化的标准，需要开发可扩展的计算机视觉方法来提供数据驱动的评估基准。

Method: 利用自动地标检测、几何面部对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析，构建了包含7,160张照片的最大配对术前术后面部图像数据集。

Result: 96.2%的鼻整形患者至少在一个鼻部测量指标上改善，71.3%的患者在整体面部对称性或感知年龄上有显著提升，患者身份一致性达到99.5%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据驱动的手术规划、患者咨询和客观结果评估提供了可重复的量化基准，有助于减少不同医生间的变异性。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical

Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准中存在Easy-Options Bias问题，VLMs仅凭视觉和选项就能猜对答案，无需问题。提出了GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建了无偏数据集来更真实评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准存在选项偏差问题，模型可以通过视觉-选项相似性匹配轻松猜对答案，无法真实评估模型的实际问答能力。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，开发GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，应用到NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建无偏标注。

Result: 在无偏标注上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下准确率接近随机，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率显著下降，提供了更真实的模型能力评估。

Conclusion: Easy-Options Bias问题严重影响了VQA基准的有效性，GroundAttack工具和创建的无偏数据集为更准确评估VLMs的问答能力提供了解决方案。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 有效的知识蒸馏和结构化多智能体监督可以使轻量级视觉语言模型具备复杂推理能力，便于在边缘设备上高效部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功实现了对面部多个运动的独立控制和跨模态兼容，为可控说话头生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和复发预防至关重要，但传统CNN模型在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面存在局限，影响在多变成像条件下的性能

Method: 对Vision Transformers和基于CNN的模型进行对比分析，使用两个离体数据集（CCD相机和柔性输尿管镜图像），评估在不同成像条件下的表现

Result: ViT-base模型在所有成像条件下均优于ResNet50基线。在最复杂的子集（内窥镜图像切片）中，ViT达到95.2%准确率和95.1% F1分数，而ResNet50仅为64.5%和59.3%。在CCD相机图像的混合视图子集中，ViT达到87.1%准确率，CNN为78.4%

Conclusion: ViT架构提供了卓越的分类性能，为肾结石图像分析提供了可扩展的CNN替代方案

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

*Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Yuxin Cheng,Chen Zhang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多图像，减少参数60%的同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示(INR)在处理多图像时计算和存储效率低下的问题

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR可节省60%参数，处理100张图像时平均PSNR保持在34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效且鲁棒，能够高效处理多图像编码任务

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时量化权重和激活值，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs依赖全精度数值表示导致硬件开销大，现有量化方法主要关注权重量化，激活值量化不足，无法充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案，利用哈达玛变换将不同层权重和激活值的多样化分布标准化为统一钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器，实现权重和激活值的联合量化。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本减少延迟32.7%、能耗40.1%、资源使用率最高达98.3%，优于先前量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs量化问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了硬件效率，并提供了FPGA实现验证其实际优势。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出的鲁棒损失函数有效增强了INRs对权重扰动的抵抗力，为隐式神经表示在实际应用中的可靠部署提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Motivation: 微表情持续时间短、强度低，现有深度学习方法在提取细粒度时空特征方面存在困难，需要更有效的特征提取方法来提升识别性能。

Method: 提出FAMNet融合模型，包含2D CNN AMNet2D和3D CNN AMNet3D，采用Resnet18共享主干网络和注意力模块，通过多任务学习联合训练微表情识别和面部动作单元检测任务，采用参数硬共享进行信息关联。

Result: 在SAMM、CASME II和MMEW数据集上分别达到83.75%(UAR)和84.03%(UF1)；在更具挑战性的CAS(ME)^3数据集上达到51%(UAR)和43.42%(UF1)。

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和分层注意力机制有效提升了微表情识别性能，证明了融合2D和3D CNN以及多任务学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Conclusion: CORENet通过跨模态学习成功解决了4D雷达点云噪声问题，为恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Motivation: 多视图聚类中，虽然学习视图间一致性和互补性可提升性能，但面向聚类的表示学习常被忽视，需要探索更有效的表示来增强特征空间和簇空间的区分度

Method: 三模块框架：1)多视图实例学习模块通过重构自编码器和对比学习对齐一致信息并保留私有特征；2)特征和簇的双层解耦增强区分度；3)一致性学习模块将样本的不同视图及其邻居作为正对，学习聚类分配一致性并压缩簇内空间

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双层解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分度和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR成像技术忽视了快门速度与ISO之间的复杂交互关系，未考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应，需要更好的曝光参数优化方法

Method: 基于强化学习的AdaptiveAE方法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图，自适应选择最优ISO和快门速度序列

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够基于用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应选择最佳曝光参数组合，找到比传统解决方案更好的曝光调度方案

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于量化的标记化方法（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，往往忽略几何结构，因为其基于patch的设计存在固有局限性

Method: 提出视觉高斯量化（VGQ）框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，通过增加2D高斯密度来提升重建保真度

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ达到rFID 1.00的重建质量，通过增加高斯密度进一步提升至rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93，大幅超越现有方法

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布提供了一种在token效率和视觉丰富度之间灵活权衡的新范式，显著改善了结构化视觉信息的建模能力

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Motivation: 深度学习面临的一个主要挑战是观测训练样本与真实分布之间的差距，这种差距可能由采样偏差、噪声等多种原因造成。在基础模型时代，研究者发现现成的视觉基础模型提取的特征分布几何形状具有跨域可迁移性，这为解决数据异构性和样本不平衡问题提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了基础模型特征分布的几何形状具有显著的可迁移性，基于此开发的分布校准框架能够有效解决联邦学习和长尾识别中的关键挑战，为处理数据分布偏差问题提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as

particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,

Conclusion: EAvatar框架有效解决了3DGS在头像重建中的局限性，为AR/VR、游戏和多媒体内容创作提供了高质量的实时渲染解决方案

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题，在2D图像和3D重建任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间局部化；2) WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数，显式指导频率信息到网络

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INRs

Conclusion: FLAIR通过创新的频率感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: GazeProphet是一种纯软件方法，通过结合球形视觉变换器和LSTM时序编码器，无需专用眼动追踪硬件即可预测VR中的注视位置，实现了3.83度的中位角度误差，比传统方法提升24%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注视点渲染技术需要昂贵的硬件眼动追踪系统，存在成本高、校准复杂和硬件兼容性限制等问题，限制了其广泛应用

Method: 结合球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景和LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置

Result: 在综合VR数据集上的实验显示，GazeProphet实现了3.83度的中位角度误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，同时提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 轻量化生成式人脸视频编码框架，通过双模式优化（结构重设和操作精化）实现90.4%参数减少和88.9%计算节省，保持了重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码虽有优秀的码率夺真性能，但模型参数过大、计算成本过高，影响其在实际部署中的应用

Method: 双模式优化策略：1）结构重设-用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）两阶段适配性通道剪枝-训练期通过可学习阈值进行软剪枝，训练后使用导出的掩码进行硬剪枝

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法对比基准线能够实现90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，并在感知级质量指标上超过最先进的VVC视频编码标准

Conclusion: 该轻量化方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的生成式人脸视频编码部署

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物神经元工作原理的类神经元编码方法，通过加入人工光感受器层来增强脉冲数据的信息容量，提高SNN性能的同时保持神经形态计算原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN性能落后于CNN主要因为脉冲数据信息容量有限，而使用非脉冲输入训练SNN又违背了神经形态计算的初衷。

Method: 开发了类神经元编码方法，模拟生物神经元的内在操作原理生成脉冲数据，并加入人工光感受器层使脉冲数据携带颜色和亮度信息。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法有效增加了脉冲信号的信息含量，提高了SNN性能，同时遵循神经形态计算原则。

Conclusion: 这种生物启发方法具有很强的发展潜力，可能有助于克服神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督字典查找机制实现跨类别泛化，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要解决无需重新训练即可检测未见类别异常的问题。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1)字典构建-用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2)字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常；3)查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在七个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

TL;DR: Learnable SMPLify是一个神经框架，用单次回归模型替代SMPLify的迭代优化过程，实现200倍加速的同时保持精度，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify在3D人体姿态和形状估计中虽然稳健，但计算成本高限制了其实用性。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，希望实现运行时显著改进而不牺牲精度。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，包含时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对，采用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Result: 方法实现了近200倍的运行时加速，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上以模型无关方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基线，显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: 在四个公开RVOS基准测试中均取得最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过改进分割头设计和特征提取方法，显著提升了参考视频目标分割的准确性和边界质量

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 提出的混合扩散-GAN方法能够有效生成逼真的恶劣天气图像，显著改善自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下的感知性能，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。现有token缩减方法未充分考虑SSM特有的序列建模特性，需要专门针对SSM设计的高效token合并策略。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的token合并解决方案，能够在保持序列建模能力的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于广泛的SSM应用场景。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

TL;DR: FoundationSSC是一个用于3D语义场景补全的新框架，通过源级别和路径级别的双重解耦设计，分别处理语义和几何信息，解决了传统方法中语义和几何需求冲突的问题，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的基于相机的3D语义场景补全方法使用耦合编码器同时处理语义和几何先验，这迫使模型在冲突需求之间做出权衡，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出双重解耦框架：1）源级别解耦 - 基础编码器提供语义特征先验和立体成本体积；2）路径级别解耦 - 通过专门解耦路径精炼先验；3）混合视图变换生成互补3D特征；4）轴感知融合模块各向异性地融合特征。

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够产生解耦和精炼的输入，通过专门的路径处理语义和几何信息，结合创新的融合模块，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

TL;DR: TalkVid是一个新的大规模、高质量、多样化音频驱动说话头合成数据集，包含1244小时视频和7729名独特说话人，解决了现有模型在种族、语言和年龄群体多样性方面泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心策划TalkVid数据集，严格筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，并通过人工验证确保可靠性。同时构建TalkVid-Bench评估集，包含500个按关键人口统计和语言维度精心平衡的片段。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。分析显示传统聚合指标掩盖了不同子组之间的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估基准为音频驱动说话头合成研究提供了重要的数据和评估工具，揭示了性能差异问题，对未来的公平性和包容性研究至关重要。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: 提出仅使用RGB图像的类别级物体位姿估计新方法，通过transformer网络预测几何特征并使用RANSAC-PnP算法计算位姿，在缺乏深度信息的场景中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RGB-D方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中面临重大挑战，需要开发仅依赖RGB图像的准确位姿估计方法以适应真实世界场景

Method: 设计基于transformer的神经网络预测和融合目标物体几何特征，引入几何特征引导算法确保几何特征准确性，使用RANSAC-PnP算法处理物体尺度变化问题

Result: 在基准数据集上实验表明，该方法不仅高效而且比之前的RGB方法达到更高精度

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体位姿估计提供了新的视角，在真实场景中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型在识别图像旋转角度方面存在显著缺陷，特别是无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转，即使提供辅助信息或微调也效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型在图像旋转识别任务中的视觉推理能力，测试其对空间关系的理解程度。

Method: 构建包含350张图像的RotBench基准测试集，测试多个先进MLLM模型在不同旋转角度(0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)下的识别能力，并尝试使用辅助信息、思维链提示、多角度同时展示等策略。

Result: 大多数模型能识别0°正立图像，部分能识别180°倒立图像，但所有模型都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和微调对90°/270°区分没有实质性改善。

Conclusion: MLLM在空间推理能力方面与人类感知存在显著差距，特别是在旋转识别任务上表现出根本性局限。

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiffIER方法来解决扩散模型中分类器无关引导(CFG)存在的训练-推理差距问题，通过迭代误差最小化优化生成质量，在多个条件生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然通过分类器无关引导(CFG)在生成高质量样本方面表现出色，但生成质量对引导权重的选择高度敏感。研究发现存在关键的"训练-推理差距"，这个差距影响了条件生成性能并导致输出对引导权重敏感。

Method: 提出了DiffIER方法，这是一种基于优化的高质量生成方法。通过在推理阶段的每个步骤进行迭代误差最小化，有效减少累积误差。该方法是一个新颖的即插即用优化框架，可以在每个推理步骤优化误差。

Result: 实证结果表明，提出的方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法。在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个任务中都取得了持续成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法通过解决训练-推理差距问题，显著提升了扩散模型的生成质量，展现了其多功能性和在未来研究中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

TL;DR: OmniTry是一个统一的虚拟试穿框架，可处理任何可穿戴物品（珠宝、配饰等），采用无掩码设置，通过两阶段训练解决数据配对难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，缺乏对其他可穿戴物品的支持，且数据配对困难限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段利用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型；第二阶段用少量配对图像微调以保持物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniTry提供了一个通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，能够处理各种可穿戴物品，且对配对数据需求较少，具有很好的实用性。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: DeH4R是一个新颖的混合模型，结合了图生成方法的效率和图增长方法的动态性，用于从遥感图像中提取道路网络图，在保持快速推理速度的同时提高了拓扑保真度和空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的道路网络提取方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种既能保持高效推理又能动态插入顶点的方法。

Method: 将任务解耦为候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展四个步骤，通过这种架构创新实现动态顶点（边）插入，同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中达到最先进性能，比之前的SOTA图增长方法RNGDet++在CityScale上APLS提高4.62，IoU提高10.18，速度提升约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的关键挑战，实现了高效且动态的图构建，在拓扑保真度和计算效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的评测套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层次，包含6000+人工验证问题和视频推理测试，揭示了当前模型在人类中心视觉理解方面的显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，但现有基准测试经常忽视一些基本技能，需要更全面的人类中心评估方法。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评测套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）和Human-C（理解）包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R（推理）提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据和主动提取上下文。每个问题都包含人工标注的思维链推理过程。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面存在困难，过度依赖查询引导的检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也有限。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评测套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用，揭示了当前模型在人类相关视觉理解方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高昂，半监督学习可以缓解这个问题。Mamba等状态空间模型在处理长距离依赖方面表现出色，作者希望探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力

Method: 提出DCMamba框架：1）数据层面：基于Mamba扫描特性的补丁级弱-强混合增强；2）网络层面：多样化扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3）特征层面：不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Conclusion: DCMamba通过多角度多样性增强，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，证明了状态空间模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%

TL;DR: 提出IPGA攻击方法，通过利用Q-Former中间投影器的细粒度视觉特征，实现更精确的对抗攻击，在保持无关内容的同时有效攻击多类视觉语言模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在编码器层面使用全局相似度，忽略了投影器模块的关键作用，无法实现细粒度操控且攻击效果有限

Method: IPGA方法攻击投影器中间阶段（Q-Former），利用预训练的视觉-语言对齐模型，配合残差查询对齐技术保持无关内容

Result: 在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，成功迁移到Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT等商业模型

Conclusion: 通过攻击投影器中间阶段可以实现更精确和有效的对抗攻击，为VLM安全性评估提供了新方向

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序将所有图像掩码为随机噪声，只保留一张清晰图像；2）重复此过程获取所有目标图像的部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，可有效增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要针对机械臂操作的小型家居物体，无法满足移动机器人平台在工业环境中面临的远距离感知、大尺寸物体、复杂遮挡等特殊需求

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，特别关注远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要瓶颈

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了该领域的数据空白

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

### [91] [Shape-from-Template with Generalised Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13791)
*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多相机3D形状非刚性配准方法，使用广义相机模型处理任意视角的透视或正交相机，通过三种不同约束条件的算法实现2D关键点到3D形状的配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单图像Shape-from-Template方法存在局限性，多相机联合信息能够扩展3D形状配准在医学成像和手持相机等应用场景的范围，提高重建精度。

Method: 提出三种方法：1)已知3D空间点的方向向量约束；2)未知3D点但已知局部参考系方向；3)结合轮廓信息的迭代优化。前两种使用凸规划求解，第三种基于凸解进行迭代细化。

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据上验证了所提方法的准确性，证明了多视角相互约束能够显著提升变形形状估计的精度。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决广义相机下SfT问题的方法集，通过多视角信息利用和不同约束条件的设计，为3D非刚性配准提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

### [92] [VisionLaw: Inferring Interpretable Intrinsic Dynamics from Visual Observations via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13792)
*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略和视觉引导的本构评估机制，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，解决了现有方法在泛化性和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法推断物体内在动力学时面临两大挑战：基于手动定义本构先验的方法难以泛化到复杂场景，而基于神经网络的方法可解释性差且泛化能力有限。需要一种能够从视觉观察中推断可解释内在动力学表达式的方法。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，通过解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层通过视觉模拟评估生成的本构定律与底层内在动力学的一致性，指导上层演化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能够有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的可解释性和泛化性问题，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，为物理合理的交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-CTX是基于Transformer的多模态乳腺癌超声分割框架，整合临床放射学报告提升性能和可解释性，在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型性能并提供临床依据的解释

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床语言，通过跨模态注意力融合多模态特征

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上Dice得分99%、IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型，多模态对齐CLIP得分85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医疗架构设立了新标准，临床文本对分割准确性和解释质量至关重要

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

### [94] [Timestep-Compressed Attack on Spiking Neural Networks through Timestep-Level Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13812)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，显著降低脉冲神经网络(SNN)对抗攻击的延迟，相比现有方法减少56-57%的攻击延迟，同时保持相似的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的SNN对抗攻击方法存在严重延迟问题，因为它们直接扩展ANN范式，未能充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理产生大量攻击延迟，不适用于实际实时应用。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级反向传播(TLBP) - 基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，实现逐时间步评估和早期停止；2)对抗性膜电位重用(A-MPR) - 利用初始时间步低效积累膜电位的特点，预计算并重用预热阶段。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上，使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集的实验表明，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别比SOTA方法减少56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过利用SNN的独特特性，有效解决了现有对抗攻击方法的高延迟问题，为SNN在实际实时应用中的安全部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

*Diaa Addeen Abuhani,Marco Seccaroni,Martina Mazzarello,Imran Zualkernan,Fabio Duarte,Carlo Ratti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督聚类框架，通过结合街景图像视觉嵌入和空间种植模式来估算城市树木生物多样性，无需标注数据即可在多个城市实现高精度的属级多样性模式恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候韧性、生态稳定性和宜居性至关重要，但大多数城市缺乏详细的树冠数据。传统实地调查成本高耗时长，而有监督AI方法需要标注数据且跨区域泛化能力差。

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街景图像的视觉嵌入特征和空间种植模式，无需标注数据即可估算生物多样性。

Result: 在8个北美城市应用中，该方法能够高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，与真实数据的香农和辛普森指数的Wasserstein距离较低，并保持了空间自相关性。

Conclusion: 这种可扩展的细粒度方法为缺乏详细清单的城市提供了生物多样性制图能力，支持持续低成本监测，促进绿化公平获取和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SA3方法解决跨域智能交通检测问题，通过注意力对齐模块和实例-图像级对齐实现源域和目标域的自适应特征对齐，在跨域目标检测基准上取得最优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通检测中跨域场景存在诸多挑战，需要解决源域和目标域之间的域差异问题

Method: 使用基于注意力的对齐模块进行源域和目标域的局部-全局自适应对齐，通过通道重要性重加权特征，并引入目标域特定的实例-图像级对齐模块

Result: 在流行的跨域目标检测基准测试中，SA3方法相比之前的最先进方法取得了更优越的结果

Conclusion: SA3方法通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功解决了跨域智能交通检测中的域适应问题

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Paul Grimal,Michaël Soumm,Hervé Le Borgne,Olivier Ferret,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的文本到图像生成方法，通过建模去噪过程中的信号分量来确保生成图像与文本提示的精确对齐，避免关键元素缺失或概念混合问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型虽然能产生视觉上令人印象深刻的结果，但在与文本提示的精确对齐方面存在困难，经常出现关键元素缺失或不同概念意外混合的问题

Method: 学习基于目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，提供细粒度控制以避免过优化和分布外伪影。该方法无需训练，可与现有扩散和流匹配架构无缝集成，并支持边界框等额外条件模态

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在性能上超越了当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效解决文本到图像生成中的对齐问题，提供更精确和可控的图像生成效果，同时保持与现有架构的兼容性

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: RED.AI项目开发了一个多智能体AI系统，用于自动化识别石材劣化模式，相比传统专家观察方法显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家团队直接观察的石材劣化识别方法虽然准确，但耗时耗力成本高昂，需要一种更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用认知架构协调五个专业AI智能体（岩相学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师和诊断协调员）协作，从视觉证据中自动化诊断石材病理。

Result: 在28张包含多种劣化模式的困难图像测试中，系统在所有指标上都相比基础模型有巨大提升。

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统能够有效模拟专家协作，显著提高石材劣化模式识别的效率和准确性，为文化遗产保护提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个现实增量目标检测基准RICO（D-RICO和EC-RICO），发现现有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面表现不佳，重放少量旧数据即可超越所有方法，但单独训练仍最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多使用合成简化基准，无法反映真实世界性能。需要构建更现实的基准来评估增量学习方法在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 构建了两个现实增量目标检测基准：D-RICO（固定类别但存在域偏移）和EC-RICO（每步增加新域和新类别）。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件、相机传感器等。

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现不佳，重放少量先前数据已经超越所有方法，但单独训练数据仍然最优。

Conclusion: 增量学习方法存在明显性能差距，归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足。需要更有效的方法来解决现实增量学习挑战。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示（LCRs）来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习语义基础的表征，提高模型对分布偏移的鲁棒性，无需主训练集中的概念标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往在分布内表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力差，容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量、解耦的概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的LCRs，并通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念潜在子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中，LCRReg显著提高了对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升了合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可改善模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 该研究使用Sentinel-5P卫星数据和ConvLSTM神经网络对南亚雾霾事件进行5天间隔的气溶胶指数预测，取得了较好的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚雾霾事件严重影响印度-恒河平原地区，但区域尺度的实时颗粒物浓度预测系统尚未建立，需要开发有效的预测模型。

Method: 利用2019-2023年Sentinel-5P大气成分数据，采用卷积长短期记忆(ConvLSTM)神经网络，以340-380nm紫外气溶胶指数作为预测因子，捕捉时空相关性。

Result: 模型能够以5天间隔预测气溶胶指数，均方误差约0.0018，损失约0.3995，结构相似性指数约0.74，表现出良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能有效预测南亚雾霾事件，但可通过整合更多数据和优化架构来进一步提升预测精度。

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 提出的SCRNet框架通过巧妙结合卷积和注意力机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中长距离依赖和局部上下文信息的平衡问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Result: 方法在1分钟内从单图像生成高保真4D仿真，相比先前工作实现了显著加速，同时提供逼真的渲染结果

Conclusion: PhysGM有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了快速且高质量的物理仿真解决方案

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）导致图像质量下降，影响下游视觉任务。现有方法通常只针对单一光照退化类型，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力。

Conclusion: DIME-Net框架通过统一的方法有效处理多样化光照退化问题，在复杂光照条件下具有实际多媒体应用的潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

*Andrea Atzori,Fadi Boutros,Naser Damer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-FIQA是一种基于Vision Transformer的人脸图像质量评估方法，通过可学习的质量token来预测人脸图像在识别系统中的效用分数，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FIQA方法主要依赖CNN架构，而Vision Transformer在图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要开发基于ViT的高效FIQA解决方案。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像块token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双分支结构分别处理身份识别和质量预测任务。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型（包括CNN和ViT架构）上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能表现。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在建模人脸图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力成为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础架构。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Motivation: 解决城际高速公路自动驾驶的长距离感知需求（至少250米），克服传统BEV方法在长距离时内存和计算成本二次增长的问题，同时支持从轻型乘用车到重型卡车的自动驾驶扩展

Method: 基于稀疏表示构建高效的多模态时序特征3D编码，引入新颖的自监督预训练方案，能够从无标签的相机-LiDAR数据中进行大规模学习

Result: 感知距离扩展到250米，目标检测mAP提升26.6%，LiDAR预测的Chamfer距离降低30.5%，相比现有方法有显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了长距离感知的挑战，为高速公路自动驾驶提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在重型卡车等需要更长规划视野的应用场景中

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖关键帧导致场景重建不完整，且在线处理限制使用过多帧或训练迭代，需要从多样化视角提升场景覆盖度

Method: 在线分析重建质量，选择最优非关键帧进行额外训练，结合关键帧和选择帧从多视角细化不完整区域，并集成在线多视角立体方法确保3D信息一致性

Result: 在复杂户外场景中超越现有最先进方法，表现出卓越性能

Conclusion: 自适应视角选择策略有效解决了在线3DGS建模中的场景完整性问题，为RGB-only帧的3D重建提供了高质量解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: Noisy Alignment (NA)是一种针对自监督对比学习的数据投毒后门攻击方法，通过显式抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分，利用对比学习的随机裁剪机制实现最优布局优化，在保持干净数据准确性的同时达到最先进的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据投毒对比学习攻击(DPCLs)效果有限，主要依赖于脆弱的隐式共现关系，且对后门图像中判别性特征的抑制不足。需要开发更有效的方法来提升攻击效果。

Method: 提出Noisy Alignment方法，通过战略性地操纵对比学习的随机裁剪机制，将过程建模为图像布局优化问题，并使用理论推导的最优参数来显式抑制中毒图像中的噪声成分。

Result: 该方法简单而有效，相比现有DPCLs达到最先进的性能，同时保持干净数据的准确性，并且对常见的后门防御具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment通过显式噪声对齐机制成功解决了现有DPCLs的局限性，为对比学习中的数据投毒后门攻击提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Conclusion: InfiniteTalk方法成功解决了长序列视频配音的挑战，实现了高质量的音频驱动全身动画生成，为视频AIGC领域带来了突破

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense

ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文对数据库、数据仓库、网页和知识图谱日志使用进行了系统性综述，分析了300多篇文献，发现日志使用缺乏标准化管道，但存在共享的结构元素，为未来研究提供了方向。


<details>

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Abstract: Colon polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, a leading cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving
patient outcomes. This study investigates the application of deep
learning-based object detection for early polyp identification using
colonoscopy images. We utilize the Kvasir-SEG dataset, applying extensive data

0.86. These findings demonstrate that YOLOv5l provides superior detection
performance for colon polyp localization, offering a promising tool for
enhancing colorectal cancer screening accuracy.

Abstract: Radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics require decision-making
that integrates medical images, textual reports, and quantitative data under
high-stakes conditions. With the introduction of GPT-5, it is critical to
assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into
measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for
visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated,
multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated
Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice
questions spanning treatment planning, dosimetry, imaging, and quality
assurance. Across all datasets, GPT-5 achieved the highest accuracy, with
substantial gains over GPT-4o up to +20.00% in challenging anatomical regions

in brain-tissue interpretation. On the board-style physics questions, GPT-5
attained 90.7% accuracy (136/150), exceeding the estimated human passing
threshold, while GPT-4o trailed at 78.0%. These results demonstrate that GPT-5
delivers consistent and often pronounced performance improvements over GPT-4o
in both image-grounded reasoning and domain-specific numerical problem-solving,
highlighting its potential to augment expert workflows in medical imaging and
therapeutic physics.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和胸部X光病灶信息来解决医学AI知识不足的问题，在提高检测敏感性的同时降低了诊断不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI在肺癌诊断中存在诊断不确定性，医生对其信任度有限，阻碍了临床广泛应用。这主要是因为医学AI缺乏医生所具有的丰富背景知识和临床经验。

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生的背景知识和胸部X光病灶信息。使用2,517张无病灶图像和656张结节图像进行训练。

Result: 模型达到92%的性能（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感性比基线模型提高10%，不确定性指标熵值降低0.2。

Conclusion: 通过整合医生的背景知识，医学AI可以在提高诊断性能的同时有效降低诊断不确定性，为解决医学AI临床信任问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中枢神经系统脱髓鞘疾病（如多发性硬化症MS和急性播散性脑脊髓炎ADEM）的诊断和监测主要依赖MRI检测病变，但儿科病例和MS以外的脱髓鞘疾病公开数据集严重缺乏。

Method: 收集13名确诊脱髓鞘疾病的儿科患者的MRI扫描数据（包括3例ADEM），提供病变分割掩码和详细的患者元数据（诊断、治疗、个人医疗背景、实验室结果等）。

Result: 使用现有MS数据集训练的最先进病变分割模型进行评估，结果表明多样化数据集的重要性，验证了该儿科数据集的质量和相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了儿科脱髓鞘疾病公开数据集的空白，为开发更精准的诊断工具和促进相关研究提供了重要资源，强调了多样化训练数据对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫预防筛查在低中收入国家面临专业医疗人员缺乏和主观性问题，需要一种价格可批、简单易用的自动化解决方案

Method: 采用EfficientDet-Lite3作为关键区域检测器，结合MobileNet-V2分类模型，部署在Android设备上，无需互联网连接

Result: 分类模型在测试集上达到准确率92.31%、敏感度98.24%、特异性88.37%

Conclusion: 该系统为资源贫乏地区提供了一种有前景的自动化筛查方案，可以减少对高级医疗人员的依赖

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射技术主要关注外部表面建模，而内部场景重建对于理解物体内部结构至关重要，特别是在需要深度理解物体内部的应用中

Method: 直接通过内部3D高斯分布建模连续体积密度，从稀疏切片数据重建内部结构，无需相机位姿，采用即插即用方式

Result: 有效重建平滑且详细的内部分结构，与任何数据模态都天然兼容

Conclusion: InnerGS方法为内部场景重建提供了一种高效解决方案，填补了现有技术在内部结构建模方面的空白，具有重要的应用价值

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的单次采集扩散MRI失真校正方法，无需传统方法所需的blip-up/blip-down图像对，性能媲美topup


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散MRI失真校正方法需要blip-up和blip-down图像对，限制了在单相位编码方向采集的回顾性数据中的应用

Method: 深度学习模型，仅使用单次采集（blip-up或blip-down）数据进行磁化率失真校正

Result: 实验结果显示该方法性能与topup相当

Conclusion: 该方法可作为扩散MRI磁化率失真校正的高效实用替代方案

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI预后研究采用癌症特异性模型，每个癌症对应一个独立模型，无法利用其他癌症的预后知识，限制了在罕见肿瘤疾病中的扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含13种癌症的大型数据集UNI2-h-DSS，设计实验分析知识迁移影响因素，提出基于路由机制的MoE-PKT方法利用其他癌症的通用预后知识。

Result: 研究表明预后知识在不同癌症间具有可迁移性，特别是在罕见肿瘤疾病中，提出的MoE-PKT方法能够有效利用跨癌症的通用预后知识。

Conclusion: Path-PKT为WSI癌症预后知识迁移研究奠定了坚实基础，证明了跨癌症知识共享的可行性，为解决罕见肿瘤预后问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Method: 系统综述方法，分析了46个公开腹部CT数据集（共50,256项研究），对其中19个≥100病例的数据集进行偏差评估。

Result: 发现数据集存在显著冗余和地理偏见，高风险偏差类别中领域偏移占63%，选择偏差占57%，这些偏差可能影响模型在不同医疗环境中的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出针对性改进策略，包括多机构合作、采用标准化协议、有意纳入多样化患者群体和成像技术，以支持开发更公平和临床稳健的腹部成像AI模型。

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our
codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习方法开发了一种实时的脑血管自动分割系统，通过踏频超声进行脑底Willis环的准确分析，以减少对操作者经验的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑底Willis环与缪血性脑梗塞关系密切，但当前的踏频超声检查很容易受到操作者经验的影响，限制了其应用。需要一种能够提高检查可靠性的技术方案。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale
validation.

TL;DR: NeuSee是首个全可见光谱范围内的高保真传感器保护计算成像框架，通过联合学习衍射光学元件和Mamba-GAN网络，能够抑制高达传感器饱和阈值10^6倍的激光辐照度，在恢复图像质量方面提升10.1%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器视觉系统容易受到激光耀斑的影响，强烈的激光照射会通过过饱和或永久损坏传感器像素来致盲和扭曲其对环境的感知，需要开发有效的保护方法

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum
imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in

Conclusion: 相似性融合块和one-hot标签空间的有效性得到验证，能够处理标签类别不一致问题，提升模型在多数据集上的性能表现

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Motivation: 传统基于CT的骨骼建模方法存在辐射高、灵活性差、耗时长等局限，无法在术中应用，需要一种更快速、安全的替代方案。

Method: 采用半监督重建与知识蒸馏(SSR-KD)的AI框架，从双平面X光片快速重建骨骼三维模型。

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical
structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models
are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the
process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and
significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative
applications in orthopedics.

TL;DR: UNICON是一个统一的持续学习框架，使医学基础模型能够无缝适应不同领域、任务和模态，无需为每个新任务重新训练，避免了灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，为每个领域、模态或任务预训练基础模型具有挑战性。需要一种方法让模型能够持续学习新知识而无需大量数据。

Method: 提出UNICON框架，通过精心整合使基础模型能够动态扩展到不同成像模态、解剖区域和临床目标，避免任务干扰和灾难性遗忘。

Result: 将胸部CT基础模型从分类任务扩展到预后和分割任务，性能均有提升。持续整合PET扫描后，Dice分数比基线提高5%。

Conclusion: 基础模型不受初始训练范围限制，可以持续进化，为医学影像通用AI模型的发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Method: 采用标准点目标模型，使用泊松多伯努利混合滤波器计算后验密度，参数选择结合第一原理和数据驱动方法，使用MOT-17公开数据集进行参数识别。

Result: PMBM算法显示出有希望的结果，但发现了标准点目标模型与数据之间的不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法表明，通过修正导致模型与数据不匹配的问题组件，可以在未来开发出更好的基于模型的算法。

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

Motivation: 模拟IC设计依赖经验且仿真效率低，传统公式在先进节点失效，直接应用LLM存在盲目猜测风险，需要将工程原理与AI能力结合

Method: 协同推理框架，将LLM的战略推理能力与gm/Id方法的物理精度相结合，为LLM提供gm/Id查找表实现定量数据驱动设计

Result: 在两级运放设计中，Gemini模型在5次迭代内满足所有TT工艺角规格，并扩展到所有PVT工艺角；相比资深工程师设计，达到准专家质量且效率提升一个数量级

Conclusion: 通过将LLM推理与科学电路设计方法相结合，为真正的模拟设计自动化验证了一条可行路径，gm/Id数据是实现这种效率和精度的关键

Abstract: Analog IC design is a bottleneck due to its reliance on experience and
inefficient simulations, as traditional formulas fail in advanced nodes.
Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to this problem risks mere
"guessing" without engineering principles. We present a "synergistic reasoning"
framework that integrates an LLM's strategic reasoning with the physical
precision of the gm/Id methodology. By empowering the LLM with gm/Id lookup
tables, it becomes a quantitative, data-driven design partner.
  We validated this on a two-stage op-amp, where our framework enabled the
Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended
optimization to all PVT corners. A crucial ablation study proved gm/Id data is
key for this efficiency and precision; without it, the LLM is slower and
deviates. Compared to a senior engineer's design, our framework achieves
quasi-expert quality with an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. This
work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM
reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

Result: 在离线数据集上显著超越基线模型，在线人工评估中获得实质性收益提升

Conclusion: TaoSR1为相关性分类任务引入了CoT推理的新范式，成功解决了LLM直接部署的关键挑战

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

Motivation: 现有的线性自编码器依赖稀疏的词共现模式，无法充分捕捉丰富的文本语义信息，限制了推荐系统的语义表示能力

Method: 两阶段优化策略：1) 从LLM生成的物品表示构建语义物品相关性矩阵；2) 从协同信号学习物品权重矩阵，同时将语义相关性作为正则化项。每个阶段都通过闭式解优化

Result: 在三个基准数据集上持续优于最先进的LLM增强模型，Recall@20提升27.6%，NDCG@20提升39.3%

Conclusion: L3AE成功将LLM的语义理解能力与线性自编码器的高效性相结合，为推荐系统提供了更强大的语义表示框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

### [144] [ROVER: Robust Loop Closure Verification with Trajectory Prior in Repetitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13488)
*Jingwen Yu,Jiayi Yang,Anjun Hu,Jiankun Wang,Ping Tan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER是一种利用历史轨迹作为先验约束的闭环验证方法，专门针对重复环境中外观特征失效的问题，通过轨迹优化和评分机制来拒绝错误闭环检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重复性环境中，基于外观特征的闭环检测容易产生误判，而现有方法大多忽略机器人的时空运动轨迹这一重要先验知识。误闭环检测可能对SLAM系统造成致命影响，因此需要更可靠的验证机制。

Method: 提出ROVER方法：对于每个闭环候选，首先通过位姿图优化估计机器人轨迹，然后通过评分方案评估该轨迹与无闭环时的轨迹先验的一致性，从而决定是否接受该闭环候选。

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性。将ROVER集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 利用历史轨迹作为先验约束的闭环验证方法能够有效拒绝重复环境中的错误闭环检测，提高SLAM系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

Motivation: 人类能够通过观察一次就模仿工具操作行为并轻松将技能迁移到不同工具，而当前机器人难以实现这种级别的泛化能力，主要挑战在于建立功能级别的对应关系

Method: 提出MimicFunc框架，使用功能帧（function frame）建立功能对应关系，这是一种基于关键点抽象构建的以功能为中心的局部坐标系

Result: 实验证明MimicFunc有效使机器人能够从单个RGB-D人类视频中泛化技能，操作新工具完成功能等价任务，并可利用其一次性泛化能力生成训练数据

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人工具操作技能学习提供了直观且可扩展的替代方案，避免了劳动密集型的遥操作数据收集

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional
management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first
systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based
Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based
Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based
Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term
semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this
comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the
foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal
integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we
outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data
models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized
benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management
solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than
180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust,
high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation
of autonomous embodied systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在从RGB-D序列重建场景表面时存在效率低、噪声干扰严重的问题，需要一种能够快速且高质量重建的方法。

Method: 提出SG-MLP采样结构与PR-MLP结合的体素预渲染方法，采用渐进式语义建模技术，逐步提取精确的语义信息。

Result: 在7个合成场景的6个评估指标测试中，PreSem-Surf在C-L1、F-score和IoU指标上取得最佳性能，在NC、准确性和完整性方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf方法有效提升了场景重建的质量和效率，具有良好的实用性和应用价值。

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: Sketch3DVE是一种基于草图的3D感知视频编辑方法，能够处理大视角变化的视频，通过点云编辑和3D感知掩码传播实现精确的几何控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在风格迁移和外观修改方面表现良好，但在处理大视角变化（如大角度相机旋转或缩放）时的3D场景结构内容编辑仍然具有挑战性，需要解决新视角内容生成、未编辑区域保持和稀疏2D输入到3D视频输出的转换问题

Method: 使用图像编辑方法生成第一帧的编辑结果并传播到后续帧；利用密集立体方法估计点云和相机参数；提出基于深度图的点云编辑方法表示新编辑组件的3D几何；引入3D感知掩码传播策略并使用视频扩散模型生成逼真编辑视频

Result: 大量实验证明了Sketch3DVE在视频编辑方面的优越性

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大视角变化视频中的3D结构编辑挑战，实现了精确的几何控制和逼真的编辑效果

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Motivation: 传统NeRF使用直线体渲染，难以处理复杂光路场景和运动模糊图像，存在几何模糊问题

Method: 提出散射感知体渲染管线，统一六种常见光传播现象；引入自适应学习策略确定散射方向和采样间隔；联合优化NeRF参数、散射参数和相机运动

Result: 在复杂真实场景中表现出色，在生成高保真图像和准确几何细节方面优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模成功解决了运动模糊问题，为复杂光路场景的神经渲染提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Motivation: 当前LLM提示方法在结构化、数据集成、格式敏感性和工具支持方面存在不足，缺乏处理多样化数据类型和系统管理呈现变化的能力。

Method: 采用基于组件的标记语言设计，包含逻辑结构组件（角色、任务、示例）、专用数据集成标签、CSS样式系统分离内容与呈现，以及动态提示模板和完整开发工具包。

Conclusion: POML为复杂提示编排提供了全面的解决方案，显著改善了提示的结构化组织、数据集成能力和开发效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current
practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,
and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing
complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or
managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we
introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs
component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),
specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system
to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It
includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit
(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate
POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application
integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user
study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

Conclusion: CoA范式为智能体模型和智能体强化学习研究提供了坚实基础，所有研究成果均已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本限制，尽管上下文窗口已扩展到百万token，但被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态任务驱动特性

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），采用三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲区和任务驱动上下文优化

Result: 平均58.6%的记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Result: 在WikiSQL单表数据库查询任务数据集上显著提升了预测准确性，成功减少了对条件列数据和人工标注训练数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理复杂查询和真实数据库环境中不规则数据场景的研究提供了新的视角和方法基础。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Motivation: 现实世界金融文档中的表格信息往往被埋藏在混乱的多页碎片化表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，最大行数达426行跨44页，传统表格检测方法难以有效处理。

Method: 开发TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，推荐代理审查输出并推荐模式修订，实现持续学习。使用大规模手动标注数据集（22,584页，3,213个表格，7310亿美元持仓）进行训练。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解真实世界金融表格方面具有巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升提取效果至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to

*Katharina Stein,Nils Hodel,Daniel Fišer,Jörg Hoffmann,Michael Katz,Alexander Koller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的LLM生成广义规划方法，通过伪代码调试和程序变体选择，显著提高了PDDL领域中Python程序的规划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接生成单一策略并转换为Python程序，如果策略错误会导致整个广义规划失败。需要在前端增加调试机制来识别和修复错误。

Method: 1) 生成伪代码策略并进行自动调试 2) 在Python调试阶段增加反思步骤 3) 生成多个程序变体并选择最佳方案

Result: 在17个基准域上，新方法显著提升规划质量，12个域的程序能解决所有可生成的任务实例

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思提示和多程序选择，可以显著提高LLM生成的广义规划程序的可靠性和成功率

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

*Lei Chen,Xuanle Zhao,Zhixiong Zeng,Jing Huang,Liming Zheng,Yufeng Zhong,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，突破图表到代码生成任务中监督微调的性能瓶颈，通过多粒度奖励系统结合文本和视觉反馈显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中存在性能瓶颈，特别是在图表到代码生成这类复杂推理任务中表现不足

Method: 构建包含300万真实图表-代码对的最大训练语料库，提出MSRL方法使用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本级基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉级基于模型的奖励通过渲染代码成图像评估结构相似性，采用两阶段课程学习保证训练稳定性

Result: MSRL显著突破SFT性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准上分别提升6.2%和9.9%，达到与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习是解决复杂视觉语言任务中结构化输出生成的有效方法，能够突破监督微调的性能限制

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

### [159] [X-MoE: Enabling Scalable Training for Emerging Mixture-of-Experts Architectures on HPC Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13337)
*Yueming Yuan,Ahan Gupta,Jianping Li,Sajal Dash,Feiyi Wang,Minjia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-MoE是一个针对新兴专家混合架构的高效训练系统，通过跨平台内核、冗余绕过调度和混合并行等技术，在AMD GPU上实现了5450亿参数模型的规模化训练，比现有方法提升10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上训练效率低下，存在大量激活内存开销和昂贵的全对全通信问题，限制了模型的可扩展性和计算潜力。

Method: 采用无填充MoE训练与跨平台内核、冗余绕过调度机制，以及序列分片的MoE块混合并行技术。

Result: 在Frontier超级计算机（AMD MI250X GPU）上，X-MoE成功将DeepSeek风格MoE扩展到1024个GPU上的5450亿参数，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的最大模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量。

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上的训练瓶颈，为下一代MoE模型的大规模训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at
https://github.com/Supercomputing-System-AI-Lab/X-MoE.

### [160] [Input Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13654)
*Rapheal Huang,Weilong Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了输入时间缩放新范式，通过在训练和测试时使用不同策略优化输入，发现训练-测试协同设计现象，并挑战了"垃圾进垃圾出"的传统观念，证明低质量数据也能获得高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要依赖数据和训练规模扩展以及推理时扩展，本文旨在探索在输入查询阶段投入资源的第三种扩展方式，即输入时间缩放。

Method: 在训练和测试时结合LLM的元知识，使用不同策略精炼输入，进行训练-测试协同设计，并在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 在32B模型中达到AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)的SOTA性能，多数投票后可达AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(80%)，从DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B出发可获得AIME24(86.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)的最佳结果。

Conclusion: 输入时间缩放是有效的扩展范式，训练-测试协同设计至关重要，低质量数据可能带来更好性能，数据集规模扩展需谨慎，小样本即可激发高级推理能力。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

*Tai Vu,Robert Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BERT-VQA模型在图表问答任务中表现不如预期，VisualBERT的跨模态模块未能有效对齐图表组件与问题短语，为图表问答挑战提供了重要见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的挑战性子任务，需要模型同时处理视觉和语言信息。

Method: 开发了基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型架构，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，并可能加入联合融合机制，与基于LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型进行对比。

Result: 实验结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT中的跨模态模块在图表组件与问题短语对齐方面并不关键。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并为不同模型架构在此问题上的适用性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，无需人工标注即可提升视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务（如情感分类和上下文驱动的目标检测）中表现不佳，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链而产生不一致的推理。

Method: RISE框架包含两个阶段：1）Reason阶段（RISE-CoT）：使用强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2）Inspire和Strengthen阶段（RISE-R1）：利用高质量思维链子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型超越了标准监督微调和视觉强化微调方法，实现了更强的性能和更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一个无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，在复杂视觉任务中实现专业级的性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

TL;DR: HCAL：基于多任务学习的层次多标签分类器，通过原型对比学习和自适应任务加权机制解决结构一致性和损失平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层次多标签分类在保持结构一致性和多任务学习损失权重平衡方面面临关键挑战

Method: 提出HCAL分类器，整合原型对比学习、自适应任务加权机制和原型扰动机制，并制定层次违反率(HVR)评估指标

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，相比基线模型，该分类器具有更高的分类准确率和更低的层次违反率

Conclusion: HCAL通过语义一致性和自适应优化有效解决了传统多任务学习中的优化偏差问题，提升了层次多标签分类性能

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

TL;DR: 本研究通过专家调查重新评估生物特征模态，发现相比1998年的旧框架，现代生物识别技术评分发生显著变化，面部识别因技术进步评分提升，指纹识别因安全漏洞评分下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物特征评估框架（1998年制定）已无法反映最新技术发展和安全漏洞，需要建立更可靠的评估体系来指导生物识别技术在实际应用中的选择。

Method: 采用专家调查方法，邀请24位生物识别专家对各类生物特征模态进行评估，并将专家评估结果与55个生物特征数据集的不确定性进行对比分析。

Result: 研究发现生物特征模态评分发生重大变化：面部识别技术评分提升，指纹识别可靠性下降；专家评估与数据集分析结果高度一致；专家分歧揭示了需要解决的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 专家洞察与实证证据相结合对生物特征评估至关重要，研究结果为未来生物识别技术发展提供了重要指导方向，并识别出需要重点解决的研究挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.
