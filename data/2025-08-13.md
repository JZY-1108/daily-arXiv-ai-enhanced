### [1] [Argument Quality Annotation and Gender Bias Detection in Financial Communication through Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08262)
*Alaa Alhamzeh,Mays Al Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o、Llama 3.1和Gemma 2在金融论证质量标注中的表现，发现LLM标注一致性优于人类，但仍存在性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融论证质量评估研究不足，LLM在标注任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用FinArgQuality数据集，评估LLM标注的稳定性和与人类标注的一致性，并设计对抗攻击测试性别偏见。

Result: LLM标注一致性高于人类，但存在性别偏见；温度设置影响标注稳定性。

Conclusion: LLM可作为高效标注工具，但需解决偏见问题，未来研究应关注可靠性和公平性。

Abstract: Financial arguments play a critical role in shaping investment decisions and
public trust in financial institutions. Nevertheless, assessing their quality
remains poorly studied in the literature. In this paper, we examine the
capabilities of three state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 in
annotating argument quality within financial communications, using the
FinArgQuality dataset. Our contributions are twofold. First, we evaluate the
consistency of LLM-generated annotations across multiple runs and benchmark
them against human annotations. Second, we introduce an adversarial attack
designed to inject gender bias to analyse models responds and ensure model's
fairness and robustness. Both experiments are conducted across three
temperature settings to assess their influence on annotation stability and
alignment with human labels. Our findings reveal that LLM-based annotations
achieve higher inter-annotator agreement than human counterparts, though the
models still exhibit varying degrees of gender bias. We provide a multifaceted
analysis of these outcomes and offer practical recommendations to guide future
research toward more reliable, cost-effective, and bias-aware annotation
methodologies.

### [2] [TurQUaz at CheckThat! 2025: Debating Large Language Models for Scientific Web Discourse Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08265)
*Tarık Saraç,Selin Mergen,Mucahid Kutlu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的委员会辩论方法，利用多个大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟结构化学术讨论，以识别推文中的科学主张、科学研究的引用或科学实体的提及。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过模拟学术辩论的方式，提高对科学相关内容的检测准确性。

Method: 探索了三种辩论方法：单辩论、团队辩论和委员会辩论，最终选择委员会辩论作为主要模型。

Result: 在检测科学研究引用方面排名第一，但在识别科学主张和科学实体提及方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 委员会辩论方法在特定任务中表现优异，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our work developed for the scientific web discourse
detection task (Task 4a) of CheckThat! 2025. We propose a novel council debate
method that simulates structured academic discussions among multiple large
language models (LLMs) to identify whether a given tweet contains (i) a
scientific claim, (ii) a reference to a scientific study, or (iii) mentions of
scientific entities. We explore three debating methods: i) single debate, where
two LLMs argue for opposing positions while a third acts as a judge; ii) team
debate, in which multiple models collaborate within each side of the debate;
and iii) council debate, where multiple expert models deliberate together to
reach a consensus, moderated by a chairperson model. We choose council debate
as our primary model as it outperforms others in the development test set.
Although our proposed method did not rank highly for identifying scientific
claims (8th out of 10) or mentions of scientific entities (9th out of 10), it
ranked first in detecting references to scientific studies.

### [3] [Heartificial Intelligence: Exploring Empathy in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08271)
*Victoria Williams,Benjamin Rosman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在认知共情任务上表现优于人类，但在情感共情上显著低于人类，显示出其在虚拟陪伴和情感支持中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在认知共情和情感共情方面的表现，以评估其作为虚拟伴侣的潜力。

Method: 使用标准化心理测试比较小型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在认知和情感共情上的表现。

Result: LLMs在认知共情任务上优于人类，但在情感共情上表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言模型在认知共情方面表现出色，适合提供客观一致的情感支持，但情感共情能力仍需提升。

Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly common, used by millions of
people worldwide in both professional and personal contexts. As these models
continue to advance, they are frequently serving as virtual assistants and
companions. In human interactions, effective communication typically involves
two types of empathy: cognitive empathy (understanding others' thoughts and
emotions) and affective empathy (emotionally sharing others' feelings). In this
study, we investigated both cognitive and affective empathy across several
small (SLMs) and large (LLMs) language models using standardized psychological
tests. Our results revealed that LLMs consistently outperformed humans -
including psychology students - on cognitive empathy tasks. However, despite
their cognitive strengths, both small and large language models showed
significantly lower affective empathy compared to human participants. These
findings highlight rapid advancements in language models' ability to simulate
cognitive empathy, suggesting strong potential for providing effective virtual
companionship and personalized emotional support. Additionally, their high
cognitive yet lower affective empathy allows objective and consistent emotional
support without running the risk of emotional fatigue or bias.

### [4] [Real-time News Story Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08272)
*Tadej Škvorc,Nikola Ivačič,Sebastjan Hribar,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时新闻故事识别方法，结合文本表示、聚类和在线主题建模技术，用于新闻监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升新闻阅读体验，通过实时将新闻文章归类到特定故事中，解决基于事件、地点和人物的分组需求。

Method: 结合文本表示技术、聚类算法和在线主题建模方法（如BERTopic、DBStream、TextClust），提取事件和命名实体。

Result: 在斯洛文尼亚媒体1个月的新闻数据集上验证，人类评估显示方法有效。

Conclusion: 提出的实时方法能有效识别新闻故事，适用于新闻监控系统。

Abstract: To improve the reading experience, many news sites organize news into topical
collections, called stories. In this work, we present an approach for
implementing real-time story identification for a news monitoring system that
automatically collects news articles as they appear online and processes them
in various ways. Story identification aims to assign each news article to a
specific story that the article is covering. The process is similar to text
clustering and topic modeling, but requires that articles be grouped based on
particular events, places, and people, rather than general text similarity (as
in clustering) or general (predefined) topics (as in topic modeling). We
present an approach to story identification that is capable of functioning in
real time, assigning articles to stories as they are published online. In the
proposed approach, we combine text representation techniques, clustering
algorithms, and online topic modeling methods. We combine various text
representation methods to extract specific events and named entities necessary
for story identification, showing that a mixture of online topic-modeling
approaches such as BERTopic, DBStream, and TextClust can be adapted for story
discovery. We evaluate our approach on a news dataset from Slovene media
covering a period of 1 month. We show that our real-time approach produces
sensible results as judged by human evaluators.

### [5] [TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08273)
*Kristian Miok,Blaz Škrlj,Daniela Zaharie,Marko Robnik Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TT-XAI框架通过关键词蒸馏和LLM推理提升临床语言模型的分类性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床语言模型在处理长文本电子健康记录时预测和解释的可信度不足。

Method: 采用关键词蒸馏和LLM推理，结合LIME改进分类和解释。

Result: 关键词增强方法在所有评估中表现更优，提升机器和人类可解释性。

Conclusion: TT-XAI为临床决策支持提供了可扩展且可信的AI路径。

Abstract: Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions
and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health
records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective
framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability
through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language
models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into
concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier
performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of
LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using
keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically
relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based
fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human
study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the
keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine
and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward
trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support.

### [6] [Distilling Knowledge from Large Language Models: A Concept Bottleneck Model for Hate and Counter Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08274)
*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Adrian Jaques Böck,Andreas Babic,Liz Freimann,Christiane Atzmüller Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种透明的方法（SCBM），利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合大语言模型和轻量级分类器，用于仇恨和反仇恨言论识别，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上仇恨言论的快速增长对社会产生了前所未有的影响，需要自动化的检测方法，且现有黑盒模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM)，利用形容词作为可解释的瓶颈概念，结合大语言模型映射文本到形容词表示，再用轻量级分类器完成任务。

Result: 在五个多语言和多平台数据集上，SCBM平均macro-F1得分为0.69，优于现有方法，且融合形容词表示后性能提升1.8%。

Conclusion: 形容词表示可作为紧凑、可解释且有效的编码方式，适用于仇恨和反仇恨言论识别，并可推广到其他NLP任务。

Abstract: The rapid increase in hate speech on social media has exposed an
unprecedented impact on society, making automated methods for detecting such
content important. Unlike prior black-box models, we propose a novel
transparent method for automated hate and counter speech recognition, i.e.,
"Speech Concept Bottleneck Model" (SCBM), using adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to map input texts to an abstract adjective-based representation, which
is then sent to a light-weight classifier for downstream tasks. Across five
benchmark datasets spanning multiple languages and platforms (e.g., Twitter,
Reddit, YouTube), SCBM achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.69 which
outperforms the most recently reported results from the literature on four out
of five datasets. Aside from high recognition accuracy, SCBM provides a high
level of both local and global interpretability. Furthermore, fusing our
adjective-based concept representation with transformer embeddings, leads to a
1.8% performance increase on average across all datasets, showing that the
proposed representation captures complementary information. Our results
demonstrate that adjective-based concept representations can serve as compact,
interpretable, and effective encodings for hate and counter speech recognition.
With adapted adjectives, our method can also be applied to other NLP tasks.

### [7] [MLLM-CBench:A Comprehensive Benchmark for Continual Instruction Tuning of Multimodal LLMs with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08275)
*Haiyun Guo,ZhiYan Hou,Yu Chen,Jinghan He,Yandu Sun,Yuzhe Zhou,Shujing Guo,Kuan Zhu,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CTBench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型持续指令调优的综合性基准，包含多维评估、算法与训练范式的全面比较，以及精心设计的任务集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统性的评估基准阻碍了多模态大语言模型在持续指令调优中的进展，因此需要建立一个严谨的标准。

Method: 通过结合最终答案准确性和细粒度推理链质量评估，比较八种持续学习算法和两种训练范式，并使用16个数据集覆盖六个领域。

Result: 研究发现：模型通用能力越强，遗忘越少；推理链比最终答案退化更慢；算法效果受模型能力和任务顺序影响；KL散度约束在强化学习中减少遗忘。

Conclusion: MLLM-CTBench为持续指令调优提供了严谨标准，并为算法设计和评估提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely on continual instruction tuning
to adapt to the evolving demands of real-world applications. However, progress
in this area is hindered by the lack of rigorous and systematic benchmarks. To
address this gap, we present MLLM-CTBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark
with three key contributions: (1) Multidimensional Evaluation: We combine final
answer accuracy with fine-grained CoT reasoning quality assessment, enabled by
a specially trained CoT evaluator; (2) Comprehensive Evaluation of Algorithms
and Training Paradigms: We benchmark eight continual learning algorithms across
four major categories and systematically compare reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning paradigms; (3) Carefully Curated Tasks: We select and
organize 16 datasets from existing work, covering six challenging domains. Our
key findings include: (i) Models with stronger general capabilities exhibit
greater robustness to forgetting during continual learning; (ii) Reasoning
chains degrade more slowly than final answers, supporting the hierarchical
forgetting hypothesis; (iii) The effectiveness of continual learning algorithms
is highly dependent on both model capability and task order; (iv) In
reinforcement learning settings, incorporating KL-divergence constraints helps
maintain policy stability and plays a crucial role in mitigating forgetting.
MLLM-CTBench establishes a rigorous standard for continual instruction tuning
of MLLMs and offers practical guidance for algorithm design and evaluation.

### [8] [Evaluating Contrast Localizer for Identifying Causal Unitsin Social & Mathematical Tasks in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08276)
*Yassine Jamaa,Badr AlKhamissi,Satrajit Ghosh,Martin Schrimpf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过对比定位器在大型语言模型和视觉语言模型中定位因果相关单元，发现低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，质疑对比定位器的因果相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型和视觉语言模型中因果相关单元的定位方法，验证对比定位器的有效性。

Method: 使用对比刺激集定位高激活单元，并通过针对性消融评估其因果作用，比较不同单元对任务性能的影响。

Result: 低激活单元有时比高激活单元对性能影响更大，数学定位器单元对ToM任务的负面影响更强。

Conclusion: 对比定位器的因果相关性存疑，需更广泛的刺激集和更精确的任务单元定位方法。

Abstract: This work adapts a neuroscientific contrast localizer to pinpoint causally
relevant units for Theory of Mind (ToM) and mathematical reasoning tasks in
large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Across 11 LLMs
and 5 VLMs ranging in size from 3B to 90B parameters, we localize top-activated
units using contrastive stimulus sets and assess their causal role via targeted
ablations. We compare the effect of lesioning functionally selected units
against low-activation and randomly selected units on downstream accuracy
across established ToM and mathematical benchmarks. Contrary to expectations,
low-activation units sometimes produced larger performance drops than the
highly activated ones, and units derived from the mathematical localizer often
impaired ToM performance more than those from the ToM localizer. These findings
call into question the causal relevance of contrast-based localizers and
highlight the need for broader stimulus sets and more accurately capture
task-specific units.

### [9] [Objective Metrics for Evaluating Large Language Models Using External Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08277)
*Haoze Du,Richard Li,Edward Gehringer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用主观指标评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的框架，通过自动化、透明的评分减少人为干预，确保评估的一致性和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM性能时避免主观评估的挑战，尤其是在教育和科学等高风险领域。

Method: 利用不同学期的文本材料生成主观指标，结合基准测试、事实数据集和结构化评估流程，实现自动化评分。

Result: 提供了一种可扩展、偏差最小化的性能评估方法，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了主观评估方法的局限性，为LLM性能评估提供了高效、透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet
challenging task, particularly when aiming to avoid subjective assessments.
This paper proposes a framework for leveraging subjective metrics derived from
the class textual materials across different semesters to assess LLM outputs
across various tasks. By utilizing well-defined benchmarks, factual datasets,
and structured evaluation pipelines, the approach ensures consistent,
reproducible, and bias-minimized measurements. The framework emphasizes
automation and transparency in scoring, reducing reliance on human
interpretation while ensuring alignment with real-world applications. This
method addresses the limitations of subjective evaluation methods, providing a
scalable solution for performance assessment in educational, scientific, and
other high-stakes domains.

### [10] [MinionsLLM: a Task-adaptive Framework For The Training and Control of Multi-Agent Systems Through Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08283)
*Andres Garcia Rincon,Eliseo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinionsLLM框架结合LLM、行为树和形式文法，实现多智能体系统的自然语言控制，通过两种数据集生成方法提升模型性能，验证显示小模型受益显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中自然语言控制的通用性和性能问题，支持资源受限场景下的本地部署。

Method: 集成LLM与行为树和形式文法，提供标准化接口，提出两种数据集生成方法（Method A和B）微调LLM。

Result: Method B将语法有效性提升至92.6%，任务性能平均提高33%，小模型受益最大。

Conclusion: MinionsLLM为多智能体控制提供高效解决方案，开源框架支持未来研究。

Abstract: This paper presents MinionsLLM, a novel framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees (BTs) and Formal Grammars to enable
natural language control of multi-agent systems within arbitrary, user-defined
environments. MinionsLLM provides standardized interfaces for defining
environments, agents, and behavioral primitives, and introduces two synthetic
dataset generation methods (Method A and Method B) to fine-tune LLMs for
improved syntactic validity and semantic task relevance. We validate our
approach using Google's Gemma 3 model family at three parameter scales (1B, 4B,
and 12B) and demonstrate substantial gains: Method B increases syntactic
validity to 92.6% and achieves a mean task performance improvement of 33% over
baseline. Notably, our experiments show that smaller models benefit most from
fine-tuning, suggesting promising directions for deploying compact, locally
hosted LLMs in resource-constrained multi-agent control scenarios. The
framework and all resources are released open-source to support reproducibility
and future research.

*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Albert Sawczyn,Bogdan Gabrys,Ravid Schwartz-Ziv,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前基于ROUGE的幻觉检测方法评估存在误导性，提出需采用语义感知的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉问题严重，但现有评估方法（如ROUGE）与人类判断不一致，导致性能估计不准确。

Method: 通过全面的人类研究，比较ROUGE与人类对齐指标（如LLM-as-Judge）的表现，并分析简单启发式方法的有效性。

Result: ROUGE的召回率高但精确度极低，复杂检测方法在人类对齐指标下性能下降高达45.9%，简单启发式方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 需采用语义感知的评估框架，以准确评估幻觉检测方法，确保LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their tendency to hallucinate poses serious challenges for reliable
deployment. Despite numerous hallucination detection methods, their evaluations
often rely on ROUGE, a metric based on lexical overlap that misaligns with
human judgments. Through comprehensive human studies, we demonstrate that while
ROUGE exhibits high recall, its extremely low precision leads to misleading
performance estimates. In fact, several established detection methods show
performance drops of up to 45.9\% when assessed using human-aligned metrics
like LLM-as-Judge. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simple heuristics based
on response length can rival complex detection techniques, exposing a
fundamental flaw in current evaluation practices. We argue that adopting
semantically aware and robust evaluation frameworks is essential to accurately
gauge the true performance of hallucination detection methods, ultimately
ensuring the trustworthiness of LLM outputs.

### [12] [Sacred or Synthetic? Evaluating LLM Reliability and Abstention for Religious Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08287)
*Farah Atif,Nursultan Askarbekuly,Kareem Darwish,Monojit Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为FiqhQA的新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在伊斯兰教法裁决中的表现，特别关注四大逊尼派学派，并评估模型的准确性及避免回答的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域回答问题，但其在宗教领域的可靠性和准确性尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别关注伊斯兰教法裁决的细粒度评估。

Method: 通过零样本和避免回答实验，评估LLMs在不同语言（阿拉伯语和英语）及不同法学学派中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在准确性上表现最佳，而Gemini和Fanar在避免回答方面更优。所有模型在阿拉伯语中的表现均下降。

Conclusion: 研究强调在宗教应用中需任务特定评估和谨慎部署LLMs，并首次为伊斯兰法学细粒度裁决生成提供了基准。

Abstract: Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering
questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain
unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated
Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of
thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks
the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate
abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on
their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention
experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal
schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy,
Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for
minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a
performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning
for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school
of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic
jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific
evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.

*Aryan Gulati,Brando Miranda,Eric Chen,Emily Xia,Kai Fronsdal,Bruno Dumont,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Putnam-AXIOM和其变体作为新的数学推理基准，以解决现有基准因训练集污染而饱和的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理基准的准确率接近饱和，且受训练集污染影响，需要动态、抗污染的评估框架。

Method: 从Putnam数学竞赛中选取522道题目作为基准，并通过程序化扰动生成100道变体。提出Teacher-Forced Accuracy（TFA）作为补充指标。

Result: OpenAI的o1-preview模型在原始集上得分为41.9%，但在变体上下降19.6%，其他模型也表现类似趋势。

Conclusion: Putnam-AXIOM为评估LLM的数学推理能力提供了动态、抗污染的框架。

Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs)
are approaching saturation, with some achieving > 90% accuracy, and are
increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce
Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn
from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and
Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants
generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation
protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances --
yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's
o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy
drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The
remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with
non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and
highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy
with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores
reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM
therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for
assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are
publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.

*Shuzhou Yuan,William LaCroix,Hardik Ghoshal,Ercong Nie,Michael Färber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDAE框架通过Chain-of-Thought数据增强优化LLMs在教育场景中的表现，解决了过早揭示答案、低适应性等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在教育场景中表现不佳，如过早揭示答案、无法适应学生需求，需改进其教学适应性。

Method: 收集真实学生与ChatGPT的对话，通过CoT增强数据，设计针对性案例并微调开源LLMs。

Result: 微调后的模型提供更合适的教学指导，支持推理过程，有效避免过早揭示答案。

Conclusion: CoDAE显著提升LLMs在教育场景中的表现，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as AI tutors due to
their scalability and potential for personalized instruction. However,
off-the-shelf LLMs often underperform in educational settings: they frequently
reveal answers too readily, fail to adapt their responses to student
uncertainty, and remain vulnerable to emotionally manipulative prompts. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoDAE, a framework that adapts LLMs for
educational use through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data augmentation. We collect
real-world dialogues between students and a ChatGPT-based tutor and enrich them
using CoT prompting to promote step-by-step reasoning and pedagogically aligned
guidance. Furthermore, we design targeted dialogue cases to explicitly mitigate
three key limitations: over-compliance, low response adaptivity, and threat
vulnerability. We fine-tune four open-source LLMs on different variants of the
augmented datasets and evaluate them in simulated educational scenarios using
both automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Our results show that
models fine-tuned with CoDAE deliver more pedagogically appropriate guidance,
better support reasoning processes, and effectively resist premature answer
disclosure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mol-R1框架通过PRID和MoIA策略提升长链思维推理LLMs在分子生成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在知识密集型领域（如分子发现）中表现不佳，缺乏领域知识的精确理解。

Method: 采用PRID生成高质量推理数据集，结合MoIA策略（SFT与RPO迭代优化）提升模型推理能力。

Result: Mol-R1在文本分子生成任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Mol-R1通过改进推理和训练策略，显著提升了分子生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), especially Explicit Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QWQ, have demonstrated powerful reasoning
capabilities, achieving impressive performance in commonsense reasoning and
mathematical inference. Despite their effectiveness, Long-CoT reasoning models
are often criticized for their limited ability and low efficiency in
knowledge-intensive domains such as molecule discovery. Success in this field
requires a precise understanding of domain knowledge, including molecular
structures and chemical principles, which is challenging due to the inherent
complexity of molecular data and the scarcity of high-quality expert
annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mol-R1, a novel framework
designed to improve explainability and reasoning performance of R1-like
Explicit Long-CoT reasoning LLMs in text-based molecule generation. Our
approach begins with a high-quality reasoning dataset curated through Prior
Regulation via In-context Distillation (PRID), a dedicated distillation
strategy to effectively generate paired reasoning traces guided by prior
regulations. Building upon this, we introduce MoIA, Molecular Iterative
Adaptation, a sophisticated training strategy that iteratively combines

TL;DR: 研究探讨了形态对齐的标记化方法对语言模型性能的影响，发现形态对齐与性能有适度正相关，但标记化算法（如BPE与Unigram）对下游任务影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索形态对齐的标记化方法是否提升语言模型性能，尤其是在形态复杂的语言中。

Method: 选取泰卢固语、印地语和英语，评估标记化训练、微调及下游任务表现，关注形态对齐和标记化质量。

Result: 形态对齐与句法任务（如词性标注、命名实体识别）性能适度正相关，但标记化算法（Unigram优于BPE）影响更大。

Conclusion: 形态对齐对性能有贡献，但标记化算法的选择更为关键，Unigram表现最佳，混合方法在BPE中有效。

Abstract: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether
morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance,
particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we
select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi
(primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from
tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task
evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed
across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment
and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in
Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600
derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
  Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates
positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such
as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing.
However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs.
Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance
than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others
across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological
segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In
contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and R\'enyi entropy
showed no correlation with downstream performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种轻量级DPO变体（Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero），通过引入边际目标和选择性更新机制，提升小规模LLM在性能不足时的对齐能力。APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模LLM在性能不足时难以对齐人类偏好，需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 提出Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss和APO-hinge-zero两种方法，结合边际目标和选择性更新机制。

Result: APO-hinge-zero在AlpacaEval中胜率提升2.0点，长度控制胜率提升1.4点；在MT-Bench中STEM和人文任务表现突出。

Conclusion: 简单修改偏好目标可显著提升小规模LLM的对齐效果，为资源受限场景提供实用方案。

Abstract: Small large language models (LLMs) often face difficulties in aligning output
to human preferences, particularly when operating under severe performance
gaps. In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive
Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance
scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update
mechanisms.
  Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining
with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In
AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the
length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In
MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories,
particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks.
  These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based
objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource
constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型隐藏状态的变化规律，为模型的可解释性、异常检测和低风险控制提供理论基础。

Method: 结合隐藏状态变化率和模型对下一个token的确定性，提出类似能量的量，并推导出Jacobian steering控制方法。

Result: 发现能量在随机权重模型中更稳定，训练后模型变异性更大；Jacobian steering能提升语义质量。

Conclusion: 通过物理视角分析模型，为模型的可解释性和控制提供新方法，有助于模型更可预测和符合人类意图。

Abstract: We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states
of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20
open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity
combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token
certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant.
Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones,
while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater
variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method
called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way
needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy
in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic
quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this
mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly
detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more
predictable and aligned with human intent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如RLHF）仅能反映平均用户偏好，无法满足多样化需求。本文旨在解决这一问题，实现更公平和代表性的模型对齐。

Method: 采用少样本比较回归方法，结合上下文学习和细粒度属性，比较响应选项并做出对齐选择。

Result: 提出的方法在可引导多元化基准测试中表现优异，优于多种基线方法和先进技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为多元化对齐提供了新思路，推动了伦理AI的发展，使大语言模型的应用更加公平和代表性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use
scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic
alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of
attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end,
we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative
regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach
leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained
attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate
our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by
adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets,
demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned
decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative
regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes
and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods.
Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic
alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing
the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.

Motivation: 提出一种高效且通用的令牌压缩方法，以节省计算资源并保持任务性能。

Method: 使用预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型，通过去噪学习生成压缩表示，并优化编码器以最大化压缩质量。

Result: 在2倍压缩下性能接近未压缩模型，8倍压缩时性能下降较小，适用于问答、摘要和多向量检索任务。

Conclusion: DeCAL在预计算密集表示场景中具有显著优势，未来可进一步扩展其适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeCAL, a new method for tokenwise compression. DeCAL
uses an encoder-decoder language model pretrained with denoising to learn to
produce high-quality, general-purpose compressed representations by the
encoder. DeCAL applies small modifications to the encoder, with the emphasis on
maximizing compression quality, even at the expense of compute. We show that
DeCAL at 2x compression can match uncompressed on many downstream tasks, with
usually only minor dropoff in metrics up to 8x compression, among
question-answering, summarization, and multi-vector retrieval tasks. DeCAL
offers significant savings where pre-computed dense representations can be
utilized, and we believe the approach can be further developed to be more
broadly applicable.

TL;DR: DepressLLM利用大规模语言模型改进抑郁症预测，通过SToPS模块提升分类性能和置信度估计，验证了其在异质数据中的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症预测缺乏高质量数据集，阻碍了应用。

Method: 引入DepressLLM，基于3,699篇自传体叙事训练，采用SToPS模块提供可解释预测。

Result: AUC达0.789，高置信样本提升至0.904；验证了在EMA和临床数据中的稳健性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI有望助力早期抑郁症诊断，需进一步优化模型和数据。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of
applications. However, depression prediction is hindered by the lack of
large-scale, high-quality, and rigorously annotated datasets. This study
introduces DepressLLM, trained and evaluated on a novel corpus of 3,699
autobiographical narratives reflecting both happiness and distress. DepressLLM
provides interpretable depression predictions and, via its Score-guided Token
Probability Summation (SToPS) module, delivers both improved classification
performance and reliable confidence estimates, achieving an AUC of 0.789, which
rises to 0.904 on samples with confidence $\geq$ 0.95. To validate its
robustness to heterogeneous data, we evaluated DepressLLM on in-house datasets,
including an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) corpus of daily stress and
mood recordings, and on public clinical interview data. Finally, a psychiatric
review of high-confidence misclassifications highlighted key model and data
limitations that suggest directions for future refinements. These findings
demonstrate that interpretable AI can enable earlier diagnosis of depression
and underscore the promise of medical AI in psychiatry.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统在理解和生成粤语口语表达时面临的挑战，如数据稀缺和语言多样性。

Method: 评估LoRA在RAG框架中的集成，比较PEFT方法，分析领域适应策略，并研究微调技术以提高语义保真度。

Result: 动态和集成LoRA方法显著减少可训练参数，同时保持检索和生成质量，但在保留语言细节和实时反馈整合方面仍有局限。

Conclusion: PEFT增强的RAG系统在领域特定语言任务中具有潜力，未来需关注方言真实性、动态适应和可扩展微调。

Abstract: This review examines recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT), with a focus on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems like Qwen3, DeepSeek, and Kimi.
These systems face challenges in understanding and generating authentic
Cantonese colloquial expressions due to limited annotated data and linguistic
variability. The review evaluates the integration of LoRA within RAG
frameworks, benchmarks PEFT methods for retrieval and generation accuracy,
identify domain adaptation strategies under limited data, and compares
fine-tuning techniques aimed at improving semantic fidelity under data-scarce
conditions. A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA
variants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive
parameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational
efficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.
Findings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce
trainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation
quality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving
fine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like
Cantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data
remains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While
selective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better
trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains
an open challenge. This review highlights the promise of PEFT-enhanced RAG
systems for domain-specific language tasks and calls for future work targeting
dialectal authenticity, dynamic adaptation, and scalable fine-tuning pipelines.

Conclusion: 任务规模扩展（task scaling）是提升推理能力的关键，InternBootcamp为通用推理模型的开发提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by
enabling complex reasoning capabilities. While recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on domain-specific reasoning
tasks (e.g., mathematics or code generation), real-world reasoning scenarios
often require models to handle diverse and complex environments that
narrow-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture. To address this gap, we present
InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task
environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase
offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited
training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated
verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make
InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,
synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing
such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we
accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow
supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to
expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an
automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.
Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning
tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to
significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves
state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established
benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come
from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two
orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning
generalist.

Motivation: 现有移动代理方法仅关注显式意图流（如步骤序列），忽视隐式意图流（如个人偏好），难以构建个性化代理。

Method: 提出IFRAgent框架，结合显式意图流构建标准操作程序库，分析隐式意图流建立用户习惯库，并通过检索增强生成和查询重写生成个性化操作。

Result: IFRAgent在意图对齐率和步骤完成率上分别相对提升32.06%和26.34%。

Conclusion: IFRAgent通过显式和隐式意图流分析，显著提升移动代理与人类意图的对齐效果。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models advance rapidly, the automation of mobile
tasks has become increasingly feasible through the use of mobile-use agents
that mimic human interactions from graphical user interface. To further enhance
mobile-use agents, previous studies employ demonstration learning to improve
mobile-use agents from human demonstrations. However, these methods focus
solely on the explicit intention flows of humans (e.g., step sequences) while
neglecting implicit intention flows (e.g., personal preferences), which makes
it difficult to construct personalized mobile-use agents. In this work, to
evaluate the \textbf{I}ntention \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{R}ate between
mobile-use agents and humans, we first collect \textbf{MobileIAR}, a dataset
containing human-intent-aligned actions and ground-truth actions. This enables
a comprehensive assessment of the agents' understanding of human intent. Then
we propose \textbf{IFRAgent}, a framework built upon \textbf{I}ntention
\textbf{F}low \textbf{R}ecognition from human demonstrations. IFRAgent analyzes
explicit intention flows from human demonstrations to construct a query-level
vector library of standard operating procedures (SOP), and analyzes implicit
intention flows to build a user-level habit repository. IFRAgent then leverages
a SOP extractor combined with retrieval-augmented generation and a query
rewriter to generate personalized query and SOP from a raw ambiguous query,
enhancing the alignment between mobile-use agents and human intent.
Experimental results demonstrate that IFRAgent outperforms baselines by an
average of 6.79\% (32.06\% relative improvement) in human intention alignment
rate and improves step completion rates by an average of 5.30\% (26.34\%
relative improvement). The codes are available at

Conclusion: 微调显著提升LLMs在ABSA任务中的表现，但零样本和小样本能力仍需改进。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their

However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to

Abstract: Transforming unstructured text into structured data is a complex task,
requiring semantic understanding, reasoning, and structural comprehension.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with
handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure,
managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes
an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages
novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key
strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided
sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We
show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the
problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table.
Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with
iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the
trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods
achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table
generation datasets available in the public domain.

Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言翻译中表现不佳，主要受限于平行数据集的大小、质量和多样性。TopXGen旨在解决这一问题。

Result: TopXGen显著提升了LLM在低资源语言翻译中的性能。

Conclusion: TopXGen为低资源语言翻译提供了一种有效的数据生成方法，改善了翻译效果。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to perform well in machine translation (MT) with the use
of in-context learning (ICL), rivaling supervised models when translating into
high-resource languages (HRLs). However, they lag behind when translating into
low-resource language (LRLs). Example selection via similarity search and
supervised fine-tuning help. However the improvements they give are limited by
the size, quality and diversity of existing parallel datasets. A common
technique in low-resource MT is synthetic parallel data creation, the most
frequent of which is backtranslation, whereby existing target-side texts are
automatically translated into the source language. However, this assumes the
existence of good quality and relevant target-side texts, which are not readily
available for many LRLs. In this paper, we present \textsc{TopXGen}, an
LLM-based approach for the generation of high quality and topic-diverse data in
multiple LRLs, which can then be backtranslated to produce useful and diverse
parallel texts for ICL and fine-tuning. Our intuition is that while LLMs
struggle to translate into LRLs, their ability to translate well into HRLs and
their multilinguality enable them to generate good quality, natural-sounding
target-side texts, which can be translated well into a high-resource source
language. We show that \textsc{TopXGen} boosts LLM translation performance
during fine-tuning and in-context learning. Code and outputs are available at

Result: 通用多语言模型表现更优，截断架构可平衡准确性与速度，但存在高WER的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 近期ASR模型能较好地泛化到真实数据集，但需注意幻觉问题。

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts,
with chatbots being a prime example, but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates
state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who
interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We
benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch
spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results
show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which
suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to realistic
datasets. Furthermore, our results suggest that truncating existing
architectures is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off, though we
also identify some cases with high WER due to hallucinations.

Abstract: As text generation has become a core capability of modern Large Language
Models (LLMs), it underpins a wide range of downstream applications. However,
most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token
at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation
speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this
challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel
text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the
token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency.
Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on
what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they
improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic
survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches
into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of
the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess
their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and
examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative
acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent
advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for
future research in parallel text generation.

TL;DR: IROTE是一种新颖的上下文方法，通过生成和优化文本自我反思，稳定且可转移地激发LLM的人类特质表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能引导LLM模仿浅层和不稳定的风格模式，无法精确且一致地体现目标特质。

Method: 基于心理学理论，IROTE自动生成并优化包含自我感知经验的文本自我反思，通过信息论目标迭代优化，增强LLM行为与目标特质的关联。

Result: 实验表明，IROTE生成的单一自我反思能在多样任务中稳定诱导LLM模仿目标特质，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: IROTE解决了LLM特质激发的浅层问题，实现了稳定且可转移的特质表现。

Abstract: Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA方法在多源异构MLLG数据上表现不佳，无法满足语义保真和多样化生成需求。

Method: 提出Magical，采用共享矩阵A和多隔离矩阵B的非对称LoRA架构，引入语义不变约束和推荐引导切换机制。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，Magical优于现有方法，并减少31.66%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: Magical为异构数据下的MLLG任务提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Lay Language Generation (MLLG) plays a vital role in improving the
accessibility of complex scientific content for broader audiences. Recent
literature to MLLG commonly employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such
as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using
paired expert-lay language datasets. However, LoRA struggles with the
challenges posed by multi-source heterogeneous MLLG datasets. Specifically,
through a series of exploratory experiments, we reveal that standard LoRA fail
to meet the requirement for semantic fidelity and diverse lay-style generation
in MLLG task. To address these limitations, we propose Magical, an asymmetric
LoRA architecture tailored for MLLG under heterogeneous data scenarios. Magical
employs a shared matrix $A$ for abstractive summarization, along with multiple
isolated matrices $B$ for diverse lay-style generation. To preserve semantic
fidelity during the lay language generation process, Magical introduces a
Semantic Invariance Constraint to mitigate semantic subspace shifts on matrix
$A$. Furthermore, to better adapt to diverse lay-style generation, Magical
incorporates the Recommendation-guided Switch, an externally interface to
prompt the LLM to switch between different matrices $B$. Experimental results
on three real-world lay language generation datasets demonstrate that Magical
consistently outperforms prompt-based methods, vanilla LoRA, and its recent
variants, while also reducing trainable parameters by 31.66%.

Motivation: 科学文献问答对科学发现至关重要，但目前两阶段RAG-LLMs中重排序器的潜力和局限性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 开发了SciRerankBench基准，包含三种问题-上下文-答案对（NC、SSLI、CC），用于评估重排序器的噪声鲁棒性、相关性区分和事实一致性。

Result: 通过评估13种重排序器在五种LLMs上的表现，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: SciRerankBench是首个专门评估RAG-LLMs中重排序器的基准，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Scientific literature question answering is a pivotal step towards new
scientific discoveries. Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented
generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements
in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage
(reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle
differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final
factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant
progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In
this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark
(SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning
five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in
terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency,
we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy
Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI),
and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely
used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into
their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge,
SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate
rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance
for their future development.

Abstract: The manual translation of unstructured team dialogue into the structured
artifacts required for Information Technology (IT) project governance is a
critical bottleneck in modern information systems management. We introduce
DevNous, a Large Language Model-based (LLM) multi-agent expert system, to
automate this unstructured-to-structured translation process. DevNous
integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents
from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core
administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary
synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark
of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns. The dataset was manually
annotated with a multi-label ground truth and is publicly available. On this
benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a
multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The
primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural
pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction
of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this
challenging problem domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐私保护的RAG框架ARoG，通过关系中心抽象和结构导向抽象策略解决匿名实体检索问题，提升检索性能并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉和知识陈旧问题，RAG通过整合外部知识（如知识图谱）解决这些问题。然而，使用私有知识图谱（KGs）时，隐私风险显著，尤其是第三方LLM API缺乏透明度和控制。

Method: 提出ARoG框架，包含两种策略：1）关系中心抽象，将匿名实体动态抽象为高层概念；2）结构导向抽象，将自然语言问题转化为结构化抽象概念路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，ARoG在性能和隐私鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ARoG有效解决了匿名实体检索问题，同时保护隐私，为隐私保护的RAG系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge.
RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like
that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses
significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential
insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking
transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected
RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs,
thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of
semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant
knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of
anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two
key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted
into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous
entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric
abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1),
the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically
capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful
semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2),
the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into
structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned
with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance.
To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies
strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and
privacy-robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化环境构建流程和可验证奖励机制，显著提升大语言模型的工具使用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在工具使用方面缺乏高效性，主要因训练环境不稳定和奖励机制不可验证。

Method: 通过场景分解、文档生成、功能集成、复杂度调整和局部部署构建高质量训练环境，并设计可验证奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升模型工具使用能力，且不影响其通用能力。

Conclusion: 改进源于对模型底层MLP参数的更新，增强了上下文理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact
meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack
of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for
tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and
designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an
automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario
decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling,
and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training
environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on
external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that
evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task
execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed
environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms
to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying
scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models'
tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless
of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these
gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by
updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

TL;DR: 论文提出TiMoE方法，通过时间分段的预训练和因果路由，解决大语言模型知识过时和预测时间泄漏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通常基于固定的网络快照训练，导致知识过时且预测可能依赖未来信息。

Method: 预训练一组GPT风格的专家模型，每个模型针对2013-2024语料库的两年片段，并通过TiMoE（时间感知的混合专家）组合它们。推理时，TiMoE屏蔽训练窗口在查询时间之后的专家模型，确保因果有效性。

Result: 实验表明，TiMoE在8个标准NLP任务和TSQA基准上表现优异，匹配或超越最佳单时段专家模型，并减少未来知识错误达15%。

Conclusion: 模块化、时间分段的预训练结合因果路由是解决大语言模型时间问题的简单有效方法，同时保持通用性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on fixed snapshots of the
web, which means that their knowledge becomes stale and their predictions risk
temporal leakage: relying on information that lies in the future relative to a
query. We tackle this problem by pre-training from scratch a set of GPT-style
experts on disjoint two-year slices of a 2013-2024 corpus and combining them
through TiMoE, a Time-aware Mixture of Language Experts. At inference time,
TiMoE masks all experts whose training window ends after the query timestamp
and merges the remaining log-probabilities in a shared space, guaranteeing
strict causal validity while retaining the breadth of multi-period knowledge.
We also release TSQA, a 10k-question benchmark whose alternatives are
explicitly labelled as past, future or irrelevant, allowing fine-grained
measurement of temporal hallucinations. Experiments on eight standard NLP tasks
plus TSQA show that a co-adapted TiMoE variant matches or exceeds the best
single-period expert and cuts future-knowledge errors by up to 15%. Our results
demonstrate that modular, time-segmented pre-training paired with causal
routing is a simple yet effective path toward LLMs that stay chronologically
grounded without sacrificing general performance much. We open source our code
at TiMoE (Github): https://github.com/epfml/TiMoE

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目评估LLMs的数学推理鲁棒性，并创建了PutnamGAP数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法全面评估LLMs的数学推理能力，需通过非数学扰动测试其敏感性。

Method: 利用数学等价但语言和参数变化的题目构建PutnamGAP数据集，测试18种LLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: LLMs在变体题目上表现显著下降，如OpenAI O3在核心步骤变体上下降10.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 新评估方法有效揭示了LLMs的鲁棒性不足，为提升其数学推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a systematic framework beyond conventional method
to assess LLMs' mathematical-reasoning robustness by stress-testing them on
advanced math problems that are mathematically equivalent but with linguistic
and parametric variation. These transformations allow us to measure the
sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more
accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this
new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with
multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math
problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative
LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models
we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship
reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage
points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based
variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that
the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our
understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further
improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型广泛应用，但其编码和重现意识形态偏见的问题仍令人担忧，尤其是在政治和经济维度。

Method: 基于政治罗盘测试（PCT），使用对比对提取和比较模型（如Mistral和DeepSeek）的隐藏层激活，并引入全面的激活提取流程进行分层分析。

Result: 研究发现解码器型LLM在层次间系统性编码了代表性偏见，可通过基于转向向量的方法有效缓解。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM中政治偏见的编码方式，并提供了一种超越表层干预的去偏见方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their
widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain
about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly
along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework
for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis
of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test
(PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer
activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive
activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple
ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing.
Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias
across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based
mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded
in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level
output interventions.

Result: BiasGym能有效减少现实世界刻板印象（如“某国人鲁莽驾驶”），并支持虚构关联的探测（如“某国人有蓝色皮肤”）。

Conclusion: BiasGym为LLM的安全干预和可解释性研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding biases and stereotypes encoded in the weights of Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Biased
behaviour is often subtle and non-trivial to isolate, even when deliberately
elicited, making systematic analysis and debiasing particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce BiasGym, a simple, cost-effective, and generalizable
framework for reliably injecting, analyzing, and mitigating conceptual
associations within LLMs. BiasGym consists of two components: BiasInject, which
injects specific biases into the model via token-based fine-tuning while
keeping the model frozen, and BiasScope, which leverages these injected signals
to identify and steer the components responsible for biased behavior. Our
method enables consistent bias elicitation for mechanistic analysis, supports
targeted debiasing without degrading performance on downstream tasks, and
generalizes to biases unseen during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of BiasGym in reducing real-world stereotypes (e.g., people from a country
being `reckless drivers') and in probing fictional associations (e.g., people
from a country having `blue skin'), showing its utility for both safety
interventions and interpretability research.

Motivation: 传统QA评分依赖资深医生，成本高且可能存在偏差，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: Sqator通过分析修订文本片段的重要性来评分，合并所有片段分数得出最终QA分数。

Result: 在12,013份放射科报告上的实验表明，Sqator能取得竞争性评分，且修订片段的重要性与医生判断一致。

Conclusion: Sqator提供了一种高效、准确的自动化QA评分方法，减少了对资深医生的依赖。

Abstract: Quality Assurance (QA) for radiology reports refers to judging whether the
junior reports (written by junior doctors) are qualified. The QA scores of one
junior report are given by the senior doctor(s) after reviewing the image and
junior report. This process requires intensive labor costs for senior doctors.
Additionally, the QA scores may be inaccurate for reasons like diagnosis bias,
the ability of senior doctors, and so on. To address this issue, we propose a
Span-level Quality Assurance EvaluaTOR (Sqator) to mark QA scores
automatically. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we
try to analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text
spans. Unlike the common document-level semantic comparison method, we try to
analyze the semantic difference by exploring more fine-grained text spans.
Specifically, Sqator measures QA scores by measuring the importance of revised
spans between junior and senior reports, and outputs the final QA scores by
merging all revised span scores. We evaluate Sqator using a collection of
12,013 radiology reports. Experimental results show that Sqator can achieve
competitive QA scores. Moreover, the importance scores of revised spans can be
also consistent with the judgments of senior doctors.

Method: 提出Culturescope方法，采用修补技术提取文化知识，并引入文化扁平化分数衡量内在文化偏见。

Result: 实验表明LLMs内部存在西方主导偏见和文化扁平化，低资源文化因训练数据有限而偏见较少。

Conclusion: 为未来减少文化偏见和提升LLMs文化理解的研究奠定基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) across diverse
cultural contexts necessitates a better understanding of how the
overgeneralization of less documented cultures within LLMs' representations
impacts their cultural understanding. Prior work only performs extrinsic
evaluation of LLMs' cultural competence, without accounting for how LLMs'
internal mechanisms lead to cultural (mis)representation. To bridge this gap,
we propose Culturescope, the first mechanistic interpretability-based method
that probes the internal representations of LLMs to elicit the underlying
cultural knowledge space. CultureScope utilizes a patching method to extract
the cultural knowledge. We introduce a cultural flattening score as a measure
of the intrinsic cultural biases. Additionally, we study how LLMs internalize
Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening, which allows us to trace how
cultural biases emerge within LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs
encode Western-dominance bias and cultural flattening in their cultural
knowledge space. We find that low-resource cultures are less susceptible to
cultural biases, likely due to their limited training resources. Our work
provides a foundation for future research on mitigating cultural biases and
enhancing LLMs' cultural understanding. Our codes and data used for experiments
are publicly available.

Conclusion: ASPD为高效LLM并行推理设定了新基准，适用于延迟敏感场景如客服机器人和检索引擎。

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of large language models (LLMs) pose
significant inference latency challenges, primarily due to their autoregressive
decoding paradigm characterized by the sequential nature of next-token
prediction. By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed
that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic
parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel
decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In
this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which
addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data
and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a
non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable
structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient
adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which
enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while
maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive
evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical
Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both
effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up
to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within
1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant
acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a
groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way
for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered
customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合弱监督学习和监督微调的可扩展训练流程，用于开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）模型，并在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）的ASR系统开发面临标注数据有限和方言多样性带来的语言复杂性挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在15,000小时的弱标注语音数据（包括现代标准阿拉伯语和方言变体）上进行预训练，随后结合过滤后的弱标注数据和小规模高质量标注数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得最佳成绩，证明了弱监督与微调结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 弱监督与监督微调的结合能够有效克服数据稀缺问题，为低资源、方言丰富的语言提供高质量的ASR解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural
human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants,
industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However,
developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains
a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic
complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable
training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised
fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we
pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the
subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture
of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the
multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data
scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了语言模型在低资源语言（孟加拉语）上的多步推理能力，发现模型在非二元问题上受益于推理上下文，但在有效利用孟加拉语推理步骤方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的评估主要集中于高资源语言（如英语），缺乏对低资源语言（如孟加拉语）多步推理能力的系统研究。

Method: 通过手动翻译英语Reveal数据集创建孟加拉语多步推理数据集，并对比评估英语和孟加拉语多语言小模型的表现。

Result: 在非二元问题上，推理上下文对模型有帮助，但模型难以有效利用孟加拉语推理步骤。

Conclusion: 推理步骤对模型预测的影响因模型和语言而异，需进一步研究如何优化低资源语言的推理能力。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly
confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we
introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived
from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question
types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric
multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated
version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce
correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning
context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models
struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by
exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models' predictions, highlighting
different trends across models and languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定长度的训练预算，未能充分利用学习过程中从探索到压缩的自然进展。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，结合GRPO和奖励函数（任务正确性、长度效率和格式遵循），逐步收紧令牌预算。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法在相同预算下比固定预算基线表现更好，准确率和令牌效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 渐进约束是一种有效的归纳偏置，可训练高效的推理模型。

Abstract: Recent work on enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) has introduced explicit length control as a means of constraining
computational cost while preserving accuracy. However, existing approaches rely
on fixed-length training budgets, which do not take advantage of the natural
progression from exploration to compression during learning. In this work, we
propose a curriculum learning strategy for length-controlled reasoning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method starts with generous
token budgets and gradually tightens them over training, encouraging models to
first discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more
concise reasoning traces. We augment GRPO with a reward function that balances
three signals: task correctness (via verifier feedback), length efficiency, and
formatting adherence (via structural tags). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500,
SVAMP, College Math, and GSM+ demonstrate that curriculum-based training
consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines at the same final budget,
achieving higher accuracy and significantly improved token efficiency. We
further ablate the impact of reward weighting and decay schedule design,
showing that progressive constraint serves as a powerful inductive bias for
training efficient reasoning models. Our code and checkpoints are released at:

TL;DR: LoDIT是一种通过利用生成过程中的特定标记逻辑来联合生成和忠实归因答案的方法，显著提升了RAG中的信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）表现优异，但其幻觉问题严重影响了可信度。现有方法在直接对齐标记生成与归因生成方面存在局限性，且增加了延迟。

Method: LoDIT通过两步实现：(1)用特定标记标识文档，并利用这些标记的逻辑估计文档对答案的贡献；(2)将这些贡献聚合为文档归因。

Result: 在Trust-Align基准测试中，LoDIT在多项指标上显著优于现有最先进模型，并表现出低延迟和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LoDIT通过联合生成与归因，有效提升了RAG的可信度和效率。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performances, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
prone to hallucination, which critically undermines their trustworthiness.
While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution
correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on
leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making
process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce
additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token
generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a
method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by
leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps:
(1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging
the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the
answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document
attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed
text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth
analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its
robustness in different settings.

TL;DR: RetroAttention是一种新的KV缓存更新技术，通过修正过去注意力输出来提升长上下文任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文任务中KV缓存的内存占用和延迟问题限制了LLMs的性能，现有方法未能解决解码过程中累积的注意力错误。

Method: 提出RetroAttention技术，利用后续解码步骤的新KV条目修正过去的注意力输出，同时保持轻量级输出缓存。

Result: 实验表明，RetroAttention在长生成任务中优于现有KV压缩方法，有效KV暴露提升1.6倍，准确率提高21.9%。

Conclusion: RetroAttention突破了固定注意力输出范式，显著提升了长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.

Conclusion: 零样本代码生成是表格问答的有效方法，无需任务特定训练即可实现竞争力表现。

Abstract: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on
Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an
Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the
relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach
consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is
supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and
analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the
generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered,
incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance
robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach
for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of
task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统对齐方法依赖资源密集的微调（FT），可能导致知识退化且适应性受限，而TF方法提供了一种更灵活的对齐方案。

Conclusion: 本文为实践者提供了指导，并推动了更安全可靠LLM的发展，同时提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs
adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional
alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may
suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the
model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast,
training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning,
decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising
alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them
adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper
presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them
by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we
provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we
identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more
inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing
the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for
practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 直接应用LLMs于患者治疗场景存在伦理和安全问题，因此转向开发LLM作为监督者培训治疗师。治疗行为训练中缺乏绝对标准，但普遍错误可识别，适合作为反馈依据。

Method: 建立错误行为指南和修正策略；构建人机交互对话反馈数据集，模拟错误行为并提供针对性反馈；微调模型后用于真实治疗师培训。

Result: 实验表明，基于MATE数据集微调的模型能根据临床指南提供高质量反馈，在治疗师培训场景中展现出显著潜力。

Conclusion: 该范式为治疗师培训提供了有效工具，解决了标准与伦理问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
psychotherapy, their direct application in patient-facing scenarios raises
ethical and safety concerns. Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an
LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of
clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the
training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to
ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard"
for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common
therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective
triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by
this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for
mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as
standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then
constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes
during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies
mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset,
the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The
detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide
high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant
potential for the therapist training scenario.

Motivation: 现有评估基准无法满足用户多样化和复杂的需求，需开发更贴近现实的测试标准。

Method: 通过用户问卷确定五类任务，构建MVISU-Bench基准，并提出动态提示优化模块Aider。

Result: Aider在MVISU-Bench上提升成功率19.55%，在不道德和交互任务中分别提升53.52%和29.41%。

Abstract: Given the significant advances in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in
reasoning and visual understanding, mobile agents are rapidly emerging to meet
users' automation needs. However, existing evaluation benchmarks are
disconnected from the real world and fail to adequately address the diverse and
complex requirements of users. From our extensive collection of user
questionnaire, we identified five tasks: Multi-App, Vague, Interactive,
Single-App, and Unethical Instructions. Around these tasks, we present
\textbf{MVISU-Bench}, a bilingual benchmark that includes 404 tasks across 137
mobile applications. Furthermore, we propose Aider, a plug-and-play module that
acts as a dynamic prompt prompter to mitigate risks and clarify user intent for
mobile agents. Our Aider is easy to integrate into several frameworks and has
successfully improved overall success rates by 19.55\% compared to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVISU-Bench. Specifically, it achieves success rate
improvements of 53.52\% and 29.41\% for unethical and interactive instructions,
respectively. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we highlight the gap
between existing mobile agents and real-world user expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理过程因自回归特性难以加速，影响高效部署。现有方法多依赖额外训练草稿模型，而READER旨在无需额外训练即可提升效率。

Method: READER结合自重复文本和统计搜索扩展推测解码树，优化KV缓存大小，适用于大批量（≥8）场景。

Result: READER在无需额外训练的情况下，性能优于现有推测解码方法，速度提升超40%，在检索增强生成任务中实现10倍以上加速。

Conclusion: READER为大型语言模型推理提供了一种高效、无损的加速方法，特别适合工业应用中的大批量任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate tokens autoregressively, with each
token depending on the preceding context. This sequential nature makes the
inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant
challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been
proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often
involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce
READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel
lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by
leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative
decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work
focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for
industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during
speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for
large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding
methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse
pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method
demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as
retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.

TL;DR: 论文提出Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO)和CharacterArena评估框架，以解决强化学习微调在主观任务（如角色扮演对话）中的奖励模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法在主观任务中面临评价标准不明确和奖励信号不稳定的双重挑战。

Method: CPO将奖励评估从样本级评分转向组级比较评分，CharacterArena通过多轮角色扮演模拟和轨迹级比较评估实现主观评分的客观化。

Result: 实验结果表明，CPO有效减少奖励模糊性，显著提升对话质量。

Conclusion: CPO和CharacterArena为强化学习在主观任务中的应用提供了更稳健和公平的评估方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) has achieved notable success in
tasks with objectively verifiable answers (e.g., code generation, mathematical
reasoning), yet struggles with open-ended subjective tasks like role-playing
dialogue. Traditional reward modeling approaches, which rely on independent
sample-wise scoring, face dual challenges: subjective evaluation criteria and
unstable reward signals.Motivated by the insight that human evaluation
inherently combines explicit criteria with implicit comparative judgments, we
propose Comparative Policy Optimization (CPO). CPO redefines the reward
evaluation paradigm by shifting from sample-wise scoring to comparative
group-wise scoring.Building on the same principle, we introduce the
CharacterArena evaluation framework, which comprises two stages:(1)
Contextualized Multi-turn Role-playing Simulation, and (2) Trajectory-level
Comparative Evaluation. By operationalizing subjective scoring via objective
trajectory comparisons, CharacterArena minimizes contextual bias and enables
more robust and fair performance evaluation. Empirical results on
CharacterEval, CharacterBench, and CharacterArena confirm that CPO effectively
mitigates reward ambiguity and leads to substantial improvements in dialogue
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，现有方法仅使用最终编码层，限制了信息传递。

Method: 提出融合所有中间层的架构，采用全局Softmax权重和Transformer Softmax模型学习特定token权重，映射到LLM嵌入空间。

Result: 在XNLI、IndicXNLI等任务中显著超越基线，低资源语言如Sinhala准确率从71.66%提升至75.86%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言LLM提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in English, but their performance degrades
significantly on low-resource languages (LRLs) due to English-centric training.
While methods like LangBridge align LLMs with multilingual encoders such as the
Massively Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (mT5), they typically
use only the final encoder layer. We propose a novel architecture that fuses
all intermediate layers, enriching the linguistic information passed to the
LLM. Our approach features two strategies: (1) a Global Softmax weighting for
overall layer importance, and (2) a Transformer Softmax model that learns
token-specific weights. The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's
embedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is
trained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.
Evaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,
our Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge
baseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala
classification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements
across Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific
gains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to
71.50%. This approach offers a scalable, data-efficient path toward more
capable and equitable multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 流程工业中的知识管理（KM）因事件日志碎片化而效率低下，导致相关记录（如设备问题与解决方案）无法有效关联。

Method: 将记录链接（RL）任务建模为CDCR问题，并结合NLI和STS，通过因果推理（CI）增强模型性能。

Result: 提出的RL模型在性能上优于NLI和STS基线模型，分别提升28%和27%。

Conclusion: 通过领域适配和增强推理能力，CDCR模型可有效提升流程工业中数据质量和日志关联性。

Abstract: Knowledge management (KM) is vital in the process industry for optimizing
operations, ensuring safety, and enabling continuous improvement through
effective use of operational data and past insights. A key challenge in this
domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related
records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and
the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation
hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this
problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly
studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document
coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference
(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal
inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into
an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while
accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain
unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed
the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and
27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation
of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can
be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and
connectivity in shift logs.

Conclusion: AutoCodeBench系列为多语言代码生成提供了挑战性基准，希望推动社区关注更实际的多语言场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While
numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation
abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they
often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to
scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,
most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual
benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To
address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for
generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual
annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases
by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a
multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order
problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we
introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising
3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is
specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical
multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary
LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The
results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,
diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce
AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their
few-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will
serve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more
challenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios.

tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training
on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This
is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support.
When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks,
it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: OdysseyBench是一个针对LLM代理在长期工作流程中的评估基准，填补了现有基准在长期依赖和多交互协调方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注独立任务，无法反映现实场景中的长期依赖和多交互协调需求。

Method: 提出OdysseyBench，包含真实用例任务和新合成复杂任务，并开发HomerAgents框架自动化生成基准。

Result: OdysseyBench能有效挑战现有LLM代理，提供更准确的复杂场景评估。

Conclusion: OdysseyBench为LLM代理在现实生产力场景中的开发和评估提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
deployed in real-world applications requiring complex, long-horizon workflows.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are
self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual
dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic
scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse
office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our
benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks
derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly
synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential
information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step
reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,
we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation
of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,
task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates
that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing
more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts
compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will
serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of
LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release
OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑丰富的指令跟随任务中的表现，提出了LogicIFGen和LogicIFEval框架与基准测试，发现当前LLMs在此类任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂性增加，自然语言指令中的逻辑结构变得复杂，但LLMs在此类逻辑丰富指令上的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出LogicIFGen框架，从代码函数生成可验证的逻辑丰富指令，并构建LogicIFEval基准测试（426条指令）。

Result: 实验显示，当前最先进的LLMs在LogicIFEval上表现不佳，仅能正确跟随不到60%的指令。

Conclusion: LLMs在逻辑丰富的指令跟随任务中存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Instruction following has catalyzed the recent era of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and is the foundational skill underpinning more advanced capabilities
such as reasoning and agentic behaviors. As tasks grow more challenging, the
logic structures embedded in natural language instructions becomes increasingly
intricate. However, how well LLMs perform on such logic-rich instructions
remains under-explored. We propose LogicIFGen and LogicIFEval. LogicIFGen is a
scalable, automated framework for generating verifiable instructions from code
functions, which can naturally express rich logic such as conditionals,
nesting, recursion, and function calls. We further curate a collection of
complex code functions and use LogicIFGen to construct LogicIFEval, a benchmark
comprising 426 verifiable logic-rich instructions. Our experiments demonstrate
that current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the
instructions in LogicIFEval. Most LLMs can only follow fewer than 60% of the
instructions, revealing significant deficiencies in the instruction-following
ability. Code and Benchmark: https://github.com/mianzhang/LogicIF

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）中的时间振荡现象，并提出两种利用时间一致性的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码策略丢弃了中间预测信息，而研究发现正确结果往往出现在中间步骤，但被后续去噪步骤覆盖。

Method: 1) 时间自一致性投票：一种无需训练的测试时解码策略；2) 时间一致性强化：一种后训练方法，使用时间语义熵（TSE）作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，单独使用负TSE奖励在Countdown数据集上提升了24.7%；结合准确性奖励，在多个数据集上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究强调了dLLMs中时间动态的潜力，并提供了两种简单有效的工具来利用它们。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising, yet current decoding strategies discard rich intermediate
predictions in favor of the final output. Our work here reveals a critical
phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the
middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this
issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal
consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time
decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select
the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal
Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a
measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward
signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative
TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the
Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we
achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and
25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped
potential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective
tools to harness them.

Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多药同时使用可能导致不良反应，现有方法因局限于功能基序表示学习而性能受限。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI优于现有方法，且在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过结合分子图像和基序序列，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的准确性。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

Motivation: 随着IoT设备的快速增长（预计2030年超过1500亿台），资源受限的设备难以处理深度学习OD模型的计算负载，TinyML提供了一种解决方案。

Method: 论文详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并探讨了理论与实际实现的结合。

Conclusion: 论文为学术界和工业界提供了实用的优化方法，并建立了一个公共仓库以持续跟踪这一快速发展的领域。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但其应用受限于训练精度差距和硬件实现误差。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的流程，包括预训练精度估计和NTKD方法，用于训练和硬件实现后的微调。

Result: 实验表明，该流程在多个数据集和硬件配置下提升了ONN性能，支持实际部署。

Conclusion: 该流程有效解决了ONN的精度和实现问题，推动了其实际应用。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量低和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MAViS采用多智能体协作框架，分阶段处理脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模等任务，并遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最优，并能生成多模态设计输出（视频、叙事和背景音乐）。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个提供多模态设计输出的框架，显著提升了长序列视频生成的创意和实用性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装虚拟试穿框架，通过扩散模型联合处理上下服装和身份特征，显著提升了真实感和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法通常分开处理上下服装，预处理复杂且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），限制了真实感和实用性。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）捕捉服装语义，人物表示模块（PRM）编码身份和姿势，A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合特征。支持基于提示的定制。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估中均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试穿提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于时尚零售和个性化应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

TL;DR: CObL是一种基于扩散的架构，用于从图像中推断出遮挡有序的对象层堆叠，无需用户提示或预先知道对象数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为对象并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡和深度信息。

Method: 使用扩散模型（CObL）并行生成对象层堆叠，结合Stable Diffusion作为自然对象先验，并通过推理时引导确保层堆叠与输入图像一致。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能零样本泛化到真实世界多对象场景，且无需预先知道对象数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督对象表示学习中表现出色，适用于多种场景，超越了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

Conclusion: 为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，同时为多模态模型在离散视觉叙事中的深度序列理解能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需访问模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式，且在安全性和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM行为控制方法（如系统提示）易被检测且效果有限，而基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式访问模型内部，不适用于API服务和闭源部署。VISOR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用的转向图像，诱导目标激活模式，仅通过视觉输入实现行为控制。实验在LLaVA-1.5-7B上进行，验证了其在拒绝、奉承和生存本能等任务中的效果。

Result: VISOR在正负行为转向任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现接近转向向量的性能（1-2%差距），在负转向任务中甚至超过转向向量（25%变化）。同时，VISOR在无关任务上保持99.9%性能。

Conclusion: VISOR为多模态模型控制提供了新思路，同时揭示了视觉转向攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

TL;DR: 利用平行文本行图像（近代文本与现代字体对照）增强OCR训练数据，通过距离目标函数减少自注意力特征差异，降低字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日本文献转录耗时且标注数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 引入平行文本行图像，使用欧氏距离和最大均值差异（MMD）作为域适应度量，优化自注意力特征。

Result: 字符错误率分别降低2.23%（欧氏距离）和3.94%（MMD），自注意力表征质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升历史文献OCR性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种用于Vision Transformers的校准模块，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度，显著降低校准误差，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而现有方法（如温度缩放）依赖全局标量且需要验证集。

Method: CalAttn利用ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度，无需额外验证集。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于不同架构，提供更可靠的概率校准而不影响准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，解决医学图像分割中的标注不足和域偏移问题，通过多样教师模型生成可靠伪标签，提升半监督学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注不足和域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法针对单一任务且性能有限，需通用解决方案。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样教师模型，结合数据增强和标签传播技术。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了框架的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net为半监督医学图像分割提供了一种高效通用解决方案，适用于多种任务场景。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出FLIPNET网络，通过切换恢复和退化模式解决盲脸恢复中的扩散先验与真实场景的差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验在盲脸恢复中存在与真实场景的差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像的不匹配。

Method: FLIPNET网络通过恢复模式和退化模式分别处理图像恢复和真实退化模拟。

Result: 模型在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，并能更真实地模拟真实世界退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了盲脸恢复中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Motivation: 现有算法因训练数据少难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且VFMs（如SAM）擅长分割但无法识别关键解剖点，影响LV指标测量。

Method: 结合SAM的分割能力与关键点定位任务，提出FCBA和SGPA模块，优化特征表示和空间引导提示。

Result: 在超声心动图数据集上验证了AutoSAME在分割、关键点定位和指标测量上的优越性。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与关键点定位，显著提升了LV指标测量的准确性和临床一致性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Result: 在多种数据集上显著优于基线，定量指标和定性可视化均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法无需标注即可有效应对复杂虚假相关性，提升领域泛化性能。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: 框架实现了对视频元素的灵活组合，能够生成高质量且可控的视频。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Result: 实验表明，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，并生成更可解释的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强多模态大语言模型文档理解可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

TL;DR: QueryCraft是一个基于语义先验和特征学习的HOI检测框架，通过ACTOR和PDQD提升查询质量，实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR方法中随机初始化的查询缺乏明确语义，导致检测性能不佳。

Method: 提出ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器），结合视觉和文本信息生成语义化查询。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义化查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测效果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Result: 实验表明TransMiter能高效迁移适应知识，同时保持不同规模和架构模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TransMiter是一种高效、轻量的适配器，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能，且成本极低。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Result: HVPL模型在避免遗忘和适应新类别方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL通过分层提示学习有效解决了VIS中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME作为一种即插即用模块，显著提升了视觉-语言知识蒸馏的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Result: 实验表明，HiWL在水印提取准确率上比现有方法高7.6%，且处理速度极快（8秒处理10万张图像）。

Conclusion: HiWL是一种高效且通用的深度图像水印方法，显著提升了水印技术的性能。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态医学图像融合方法MMIF-AMIN，通过可逆密集网络和多尺度互补特征提取模块，结合自适应损失函数，显著提升了融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态医学图像融合（MMIF）旨在整合不同模态的图像以提供更全面的诊断信息，但如何同时捕捉独特和互补信息是关键挑战。

Method: 采用可逆密集网络（IDN）进行无损特征提取，设计多尺度互补特征提取模块（MCFEM）结合混合注意力机制、多尺度卷积和Transformer，并引入自适应损失函数。

Result: 实验表明MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性，且在其他图像融合任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN通过创新的架构和自适应损失函数，显著提升了多模态医学图像融合的性能，并展示了良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

TL;DR: PADReg提出了一种基于接触力的物理感知超声图像变形配准框架，显著提升了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像变形配准在疾病诊断中至关重要，但现有方法因图像低对比度和噪声等问题表现不佳。

Method: 利用机器人超声系统测量的接触力作为物理先验，结合像素级刚度图和胡克定律估计变形场。

Result: 实验显示PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提升21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过物理约束实现了更准确的配准，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，避免了LiDAR数据的高计算需求，实现了更高的推理速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测因边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有多模态方法因LiDAR数据处理耗时难以满足实时需求。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer (ViT)提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量高效解码器。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD证明了RGB-only方法在越野自由空间检测中的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频压缩中的条带伪影严重影响观看质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了包含160个AV1压缩视频的数据集，收集了7,200条主观评价，并开发了基于深度神经网络的无参考评估模型CBAND。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有方法，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去条带模型。

Conclusion: CBAND为视频质量评估提供了高效工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Conclusion: 该方法有效修复了视觉识别模型的系统性错误，且未引入新问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）指标，用于提升眼内透镜结构分割的精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。专家标注时对不同子区域赋予不同置信度，启发提出ACW损失。

Method: ACW通过置信度阈值将透镜结构子区域分为高低置信度组，应用区域加权损失；并设计自适应阈值优化算法动态调整阈值。同时提出BECE指标量化边界区域分割的校准误差。

Result: 在临床AS-OCT数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，如IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效提升了透镜结构分割的精度和校准性能，适用于多种深度分割网络。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络的专有压缩技术破坏了低级法医线索，导致检测器在真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过估计少量上传视频的压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，重现平台特定的压缩效果。

Result: 实验显示模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，检测器性能接近真实数据训练结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为压缩视频内容下的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统在简单场景中表现良好，但难以应对真实世界中复杂、模糊的描述需求。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域和自然语言查询，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 尽管粗粒度检索已基本解决，但只有少数模型能在所有测试案例中准确匹配。CLIP模型表现良好，但对细微差异敏感。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进真实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过生成式框架和语义先验的结合，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

Motivation: 传统均匀锐化忽略了纹理变化，导致质量下降且增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导比特分配，实现端到端的区域自适应锐化。

Result: 实验验证了模型在质量和比特率节省方面的有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp通过区域自适应方法，显著提升了视频锐化效果并优化了比特分配。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF通过创新的变形和姿态建模方法，有效解决了动态人体渲染中的挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式有效解决了轻量级语义分割中的特征对齐问题，显著提升性能且保持高效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M

*Yuqi Peng,Lingtao Zheng,Yufeng Yang,Yi Huang,Mingfu Yan,Jianzhuang Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)方法，解决多概念文本到图像生成中身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的方法在多概念生成中存在干扰和空间错位问题，导致效果不佳。

Method: 引入token mask限制模块专注于关联token，并通过训练目标对齐token注意力与概念区域。

Result: TARA实现了无需训练的多概念组合，有效保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA在多概念生成中表现高效且避免模块间干扰。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

TL;DR: 3DFroMLLM框架通过多模态大语言模型生成3D对象原型，无需额外训练数据或详细用户指令，显著提升了空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理方面表现有限，需要一种无需额外数据或复杂指令的方法生成3D对象原型。

Method: 采用代理式流水线（设计师、编码员、视觉检查员）在优化循环中生成3D原型，包括几何和部件标签。

Result: 生成的渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%，并显著提升细粒度视觉语言模型的性能（55%准确率提升）。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM展示了MLLMs在3D生成和空间推理中的潜力，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [104] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）框架，通过定义各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）作为质量指标，实现了高精度分类与量化图像退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法依赖参考图像，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发一种无需参考图像的高效质量评估工具。

Method: 定义ATR指标，利用两个可调阈值量化纹理抑制，通过优化参数针对特定伪影生成高质量评分。系统分为两阶段：先分类伪影类型，再通过回归模型量化退化程度。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR评分与人类感知的Spearman相关性高达-0.93（高斯模糊）和-0.95（白噪声）。完整系统的R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS点。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像退化分类与量化方面表现出色，为NR-IQA提供了高效的双用途工具。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加码率和存储成本，因此需要一种方法在保持质量的同时节省码率。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练网络，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上的评估表明，该框架能显著提升主观质量并节省码率。

Conclusion: 该框架有效实现了视频压缩中码率与质量的最优权衡。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate在场景更新和渲染性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Conclusion: MaskClu能帮助ViTs从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义有意义的表示。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Method: 使用Attention U-Net进行术前和术后肿瘤分割，DenseNet用于MR序列和肿瘤类型分类，整合到遵循RANO 2.0指南的报告中。

Conclusion: 该自动化管道显著提升了术后评估的标准化和效率，并已集成到开源软件Raidionics中。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂环境条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过几何化建模和流形学习，新方法显著提升了LiDAR地点识别的性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该系统提高了脊柱成像的一致性和可重复性，为手术导航提供了新可能。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型内置多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需微调的基础模型结合多样化提示设计，可有效提升MAD任务的零样本检测能力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)

### [117] [Text-conditioned State Space Model For Domain-generalized Change Detection Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08974)
*Elman Ghazaei,Erchan Aptoula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的文本条件状态空间模型（TCSSM），用于解决变化检测视觉问答（CDVQA）中的领域偏移问题，并引入了一个多模态多领域数据集BrightVQA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要专业知识，且现有CDVQA方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，而实际应用中领域偏移常见。

Method: 提出TCSSM框架，结合双时相图像和地理灾害相关文本信息，动态预测输入依赖参数，提取跨领域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明TCSSM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM有效解决了CDVQA中的领域偏移问题，BrightVQA数据集为领域泛化研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

*Zhentao Fan,Zongzuo Wang,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，有效提升视频扩散模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似度和范数比来保留高分辨率结构，支持激进跳过。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下显著提升了视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存加速方法，适用于DiT框架。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用预训练大语言模型（LLMs）进行颜色推荐，提出ColorGPT方法，在颜色调色板完成和生成任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色在矢量图形设计中至关重要，但传统方法因数据有限和设计复杂性难以满足需求，因此研究LLMs是否能成为更优的颜色推荐工具。

Method: 开发了ColorGPT，通过测试多种颜色表示和提示工程技术，专注于调色板完成和生成任务。

Result: 实验显示ColorGPT在颜色建议准确性和调色板分布上优于现有方法，且在颜色多样性和相似性上有提升。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs在颜色推荐任务中具有潜力，ColorGPT为设计领域提供了新工具。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

*Ming Nie,Chunwei Wang,Hang Xu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频标记并突出关键帧信息的方法，通过非均匀采样和动态压缩比提升视频LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频LLMs在压缩视频时采用均匀采样和固定压缩比，忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，导致重要信息丢失。

Method: KFFocus结合经典视频压缩原理，动态识别关键帧并分配不同压缩比，同时引入时空建模模块捕捉时空动态。

Result: 在长视频场景的基准测试中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，计算效率高且准确性提升。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频标记压缩和时空建模，为视频LLMs提供了更高效和精确的视频理解能力。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

TL;DR: MSQ是一种多尺度量化方法，通过空间和时间维度的离散标记压缩运动序列，解决了现有运动表示在多尺度建模和组合灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示无法从多尺度视角捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: MSQ采用多尺度编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部分，并在时间维度上插值特征后量化为离散标记，基于此建立生成掩码建模模型。

Result: MSQ无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ为运动编辑、控制和条件生成提供了高效且灵活的多尺度表示。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大核卷积网络参数和计算成本高，且会破坏ERF的AGD，因此需要更高效的方法扩展ERF。

Method: 通过组合小核（如7×7、9×9、11×11）扩展ERF并保持AGD，设计了Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建UniConvNet。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上表现优于现有CNN和ViT，UniConvNet-T达到84.2%准确率，UniConvNet-XL达88.4%。

Conclusion: 组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD是一种高效且有效的方法，UniConvNet在多种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are
publicly available at https://github.com/ai-paperwithcode/UniConvNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的Inter-correction Retinex模型（IRetinex），用于解决低光图像增强中组件间残差（ICR）的问题，通过减少ICR提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Retinex深度学习方法在分解光照和反射组件时存在残差（ICR），影响分解准确性和增强效果，最终降低图像质量。

Method: 提出IRetinex模型，在分解阶段减少光照和反射组件的特征相似性，在增强阶段利用特征相似性检测和减轻ICR的影响。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，通过减少ICR，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICR对低光图像增强有显著影响，IRetinex通过有效减少ICR提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习方法过度依赖学生模型和忽略认知偏差的问题，同时提高伪标签生成的质量。

Method: 提出UC-Seg框架，包含双子网、跨子网一致性保持策略（CCP）和不确定性感知伪标签生成（UPG）。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上验证，UC-Seg在分割准确性和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg通过双子网和不确定性感知策略，有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，亟需一种能有效利用大规模未标注数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，并通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用未标注数据，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Result: 在SimplerEnv中，任务完成率比SpatialVLA提高4%，比TraceVLA提高19%。

Conclusion: 该方法在少量训练数据下仍有效，适用于数据收集困难的现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性和准确性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合低秩适应（LoRA）高效适配VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期使用语义损失稳定收敛，后期引入3D IoU损失优化边界框预测）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失优化，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来大规模压缩模型的研究提供了启发，并鼓励进一步探索压缩与智能之间的联系。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的生物特征反欺骗方法，通过纹理分析和反射特性区分真实人脸与伪造攻击，显著提升了现有系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物特征认证系统在对抗深度伪造等高级欺骗攻击时存在不足，亟需更可靠的活体检测技术。

Method: 采用创新的深度学习模型，结合纹理分析和反射特性，开发了AttackNet V2.2模型。

Result: 在五个多样化数据集上测试，AttackNet V2.2平均准确率达99.9%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了生物特征认证的安全性，还为理解欺骗攻击的行为模式提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本解决方案Turbo-VAED，用于将视频VAE高效部署到移动设备，显著减少参数数量并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频VAE在移动设备上存在计算瓶颈（内存不足和推理速度慢），需要一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 1. 分析现有VAE架构冗余，引入3D深度可分离卷积减少参数；2. 提出解耦3D像素洗牌方案优化上采样；3. 仅对解码器进行蒸馏训练。

Result: Turbo-VAED在720p分辨率下加速原始VAE达84.5倍，参数减少至17.5%，保留96.9%重建质量，并在iPhone 16 Pro上实现2.9倍FPS提升。

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有高效、低成本的特点。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将为未来研究提供重要支持，推动重光照和渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的MCTS方法，通过双层结构和树折叠技术，解决了节点选择的时间复杂度问题，提升了经典规划任务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS在经典规划任务中节点选择的时间复杂度较高（O(log N)），而传统优先级队列的时间复杂度为O(1)。论文旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出双层MCTS方法，从每个选定的叶节点运行最佳优先搜索，并引入树折叠技术以减少动作选择步骤。

Result: 实现了节点选择的摊销O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 双层MCTS和树折叠技术有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的效率问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的AR代理框架，用于解决当前AR系统在复杂多步骤场景中无法利用用户长期经验和偏好的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在支持即时任务时表现良好，但在需要理解用户长期经验和偏好的复杂场景中存在不足，亟需一种能够存储和推理历史交互的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个包含感知模块、记忆模块、时空推理模块和执行模块的框架，并提供了实现路线图和评估策略。

Result: 框架通过存储和推理用户历史交互数据，能够提供个性化的任务辅助，并展示了跨领域的实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来开发更智能的AR系统提供了方向，旨在将用户交互历史与自适应任务辅助有效结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLMs）知识过时或错误的问题，避免昂贵的重新训练，通过知识编辑实现高效更新。

Method: 引入功能分类法，结合知识类型（事实、时间等）和编辑机制，系统分析现有方法。

Result: 总结了不同知识编辑方法的适用性和局限性，并提供了评估任务和数据集的综述。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，强调了知识编辑在LLMs中的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大规模预训练的方法缺乏任务间的统一协调，难以处理复杂临床工作流中的多步骤过程，而AI代理在内窥镜领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出EndoAgent，采用双记忆设计，结合短期行动跟踪和长期经验学习，集成专家设计的工具集，支持多样化临床任务。

Result: 在EndoAgentBench基准测试中，EndoAgent表现优于通用和医学多模态模型，展示了其灵活性和推理能力。

Conclusion: EndoAgent为内窥镜图像诊断提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs依赖链式推理（CoT），但在许多任务中，其他拓扑结构（如树或图）可能更有效。此外，模型输出通常过于冗长。

Method: 提出TopoAug合成数据管道，结合监督微调和强化学习，训练Qwen2VL模型，并引入Frugal Learning以减少输出长度。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，STELAR-Vision比基础模型准确率提升9.7%，并在多个OOD基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理和高效学习，显著提升了VLMs的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在情感识别任务中的能力，并与人类表现对比，以推动情感智能AI的发展。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力，并进行个体与集体表现的对比。

Result: MLLMs个体表现优于人类，但人类集体智慧更强。人机协作表现最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在个体层面表现优异，但人机协作是情感智能AI发展的最有前景方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital

community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理参考中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a

Conclusion: MiGrATe展示了在线测试时训练在无外部监督复杂搜索任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

TL;DR: MoSSDA是一种新型半监督域自适应框架，用于多变量时间序列分类，通过两阶段动量编码器和混合增强对比模块实现域不变和类判别表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中训练和测试数据分布不同（域偏移）导致的性能下降问题，特别是在时间序列数据中。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块显著提升了域自适应性能，适用于时间序列分类。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局工作空间模型（GWM）的新方法，通过融合多个学生模型的参数来增强在线类增量学习（OCIL）的稳定性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线类增量学习（OCIL）在非独立同分布数据流中面临模型稳定性与适应性的挑战，现有方法在严格内存限制下效果不佳。

Method: 采用全局工作空间模型（GWM）和多级协作蒸馏机制，通过参数融合和知识对齐来平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了多种OCIL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了OCIL中的稳定性和适应性矛盾，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM适配器服务的性能和资源效率，适用于单节点和多副本部署。

Abstract: Serving LLM adapters has gained significant attention as an effective
approach to adapt general-purpose language models to diverse, task-specific use
cases. However, serving a wide range of adapters introduces several and
substantial overheads, leading to performance degradation and challenges in
optimal placement. To address these challenges, we present an analytical,
AI-driven pipeline that accurately determines the optimal allocation of
adapters in single-node setups. This allocation maximizes performance,
effectively using GPU resources, while preventing request starvation.
Crucially, the proposed allocation is given based on current workload patterns.
These insights in single-node setups can be leveraged in multi-replica
deployments for overall placement, load balancing and server configuration,
ultimately enhancing overall performance and improving resource efficiency. Our
approach builds on an in-depth analysis of LLM adapter serving, accounting for
overheads and performance variability, and includes the development of the
first Digital Twin capable of replicating online LLM-adapter serving systems
with matching key performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
that the Digital Twin achieves a SMAPE difference of no more than 5.5% in
throughput compared to real results, and the proposed pipeline accurately
predicts the optimal placement with minimal latency.

Result: 通过分析大规模文献计量数据，揭示了DH中知识结构的详细特征和模式。

Conclusion: TMC方法为理解DH及其他领域中技术与主题的交互提供了新工具和视角。

Abstract: Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that integrates
computational methods with humanities scholarship to investigate innovative
topics. Each academic discipline follows a unique developmental path shaped by
the topics researchers investigate and the methods they employ. With the help
of bibliometric analysis, most of previous studies have examined DH across
multiple dimensions such as research hotspots, co-author networks, and
institutional rankings. However, these studies have often been limited in their
ability to provide deep insights into the current state of technological
advancements and topic development in DH. As a result, their conclusions tend
to remain superficial or lack interpretability in understanding how methods and
topics interrelate in the field. To address this gap, this study introduced a
new concept of Topic-Method Composition (TMC), which refers to a hybrid
knowledge structure generated by the co-occurrence of specific research topics
and the corresponding method. Especially by analyzing the interaction between
TMCs, we can see more clearly the intersection and integration of digital
technology and humanistic subjects in DH. Moreover, this study developed a
TMC-based workflow combining bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and network
analysis to analyze the development characteristics and patterns of research
disciplines. By applying this workflow to large-scale bibliometric data, it
enables a detailed view of the knowledge structures, providing a tool adaptable
to other fields.

objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

Result: 在TREC iKAT数据集上的实验表明，APCIR优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化策略能有效提升对话式信息检索的性能。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线成像对早期诊断至关重要，但降噪方法常导致细节丢失，影响诊断准确性。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，且计算高效。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了医学影像重建中的关键问题，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse,
noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging
applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our
approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation
to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to
reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the
computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a
variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image
segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified
Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the
reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network,
approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo
integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational
objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to
the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces
high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice
data is sparse and noisy.

Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of
hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral
variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by
factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major
challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate
model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that
corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and
compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm
provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively
on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present
a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive
experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's
impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing
algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed
preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,
including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with
error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale
correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by
existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight
its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.
The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: FreqSP为视频锐化提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了视频质量与带宽效率的平衡。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can
effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the
sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded
Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily
improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as
over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video
quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs
effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening
level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening
level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.
Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages
intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal
sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly
categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques.
Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same
task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However,
most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras
moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically
biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct
comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging.
In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built
dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches.
We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view
synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening.
Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform
classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually
underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in
synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms
frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames
between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of
advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in
recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains
an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to
process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric
for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality
metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for
interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based
on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably
with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient
(x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then
use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame
interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual
pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or
SSIM.

Abstract: Serving disaggregated large language models has been widely adopted in
industrial practice for enhanced performance. However, too many tokens
generated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,
essentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due
to limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the
latency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt
length. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long
occupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to
separate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud
helps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.
Specifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with
its own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.
Then, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for
smoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the
progress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the
resource usage in cloud is controlled. Moreover, during cloud prefill, the
prompt can be refined, using those intermediate data already generated, to
further speed up on-device inference. We implement such a scheme P/D-Device,
and confirm its superiority over other alternatives. We further propose an
algorithm to decide the best settings. Real-trace experiments show that TTFT
decreases at least 60%, maximum TPOT is about tens of milliseconds, and cloud
throughput increases by up to 15x.

### [160] [E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09023)

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite是一种基于LLM的SQL查询重写框架，通过上下文构造和强化学习生成高效、等效且可执行的查询，显著提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的SQL查询重写方法在处理复杂查询和新模式时效果有限，无法完全覆盖高效重写策略。

Method: 结合上下文模块（利用执行计划和演示构建提示）和强化学习框架（奖励函数关注可执行性、等效性和效率），采用分阶段课程学习。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中，查询执行时间减少25.6%，成功重写率提高24.4%。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite通过LLM和强化学习克服了传统方法的局限性，显著提升了SQL查询重写的效果和覆盖范围。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

TL;DR: 提出一种从视频中估计连续光场的方法，利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，并通过微调预训练扩散模型实现零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内光照估计因高度不适定性而具挑战性，尤其是光照条件在时空上变化时。

Method: 利用2D扩散先验优化MLP表示的光场，微调预训练扩散模型预测多位置光照。

Result: 在单图像或视频光照估计中表现优于基线，尤其在时空一致性光照估计上取得显著成果。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂光照条件下表现出色，尤其在时空一致性光照估计上填补了前人研究的空白。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面部表演重定向方法，通过使用相同的框架（如3DMM、FLAME等）简化语义识别和重定向问题，并利用体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准技术优化重定向效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表演重定向中语义识别和框架转换的困难，特别是在游戏或虚拟现实环境中。

Method: 使用相同的框架进行重定向，结合体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准，并通过微调技术优化动画控制。

Result: 校准后的框架能生成期望的表达式，但在跟踪表演时仍可能产生不理想的动画控制。微调方法显著提升了重定向效果。

Conclusion: 通过框架统一和微调技术，实现了高效的面部表演重定向，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

TL;DR: 提出HybridPF方法，结合短程和远程滤波轨迹去除点云噪声，通过并行模块和动态图卷积解码器实现高效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有滤波方法存在点聚类或噪声残留问题，需结合短程和远程信息提升去噪效果。

Method: 设计ShortModule和LongModule并行模块，分别处理短程评分和远程流，并采用动态图卷积解码器优化推理。

Result: HybridPF在点分布和收敛性上表现优异，实现更快推理速度和先进去噪效果。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和远程信息，显著提升点云去噪性能，为相关领域提供新思路。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

Result: 实验表明，调色板指导显著提升了模型生成符合预期色彩方案图像的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更精细和可控的图像色彩化过程。

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟相机在控制相机设置、模拟光学效果和校准参数方面存在不足，限制了模拟到现实的转换。

Method: DiffPhysCam通过多阶段流程提供精细相机控制，模拟光学效果（如散焦模糊），并支持真实数据校准。

Result: DiffPhysCam提升了机器人感知性能，并成功用于逆向渲染创建数字孪生场景和自主地面车辆导航。

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam解决了现有虚拟相机的局限性，为机器人视觉和AI应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

Motivation: 现有无需训练的方法在颜色编辑中难以实现精确控制和视觉一致性，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过解构结构和颜色，并针对性操作注意力图和值标记，实现精确编辑和词级属性强度控制。

Result: ColorCtrl在SD3和FLUX.1-dev上表现优于现有方法，并在编辑质量和一致性上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在多种模型和任务中表现出色，展示了其多功能性和优势。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Motivation: 视频配音中，由于不同语言的信息密度差异，目标语音时长常与源语音不匹配，导致音视频同步问题，影响观看体验。

Method: 提出Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO)方法，采用分段采样策略和细粒度损失函数，优化时长对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SSPO在时长对齐任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSPO方法有效解决了视频配音中的时长不匹配问题，提升了配音质量。

Abstract: Video dubbing aims to translate original speech in visual media programs from
the source language to the target language, relying on neural machine
translation and text-to-speech technologies. Due to varying information
densities across languages, target speech often mismatches the source speech
duration, causing audio-video synchronization issues that significantly impact
viewer experience. In this study, we approach duration alignment in LLM-based
video dubbing machine translation as a preference optimization problem. We
propose the Segment Supervised Preference Optimization (SSPO) method, which
employs a segment-wise sampling strategy and fine-grained loss to mitigate
duration mismatches between source and target lines. Experimental results
demonstrate that SSPO achieves superior performance in duration alignment
tasks.

Motivation: 预训练的ASR模型在不同录音通道输入时性能下降，传统归因于训练与测试数据不匹配，本研究认为通道差异会从根本上损害ASR性能。

Method: 提出一种归一化技术，对齐ASR模型的内部特征表示与干净参考通道的特征表示。

Result: 显著提高了ASR在未见通道和语言上的性能，展示了其在跨通道和跨语言差异上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该归一化技术有效缓解了通道差异对ASR性能的影响，具有跨通道和跨语言的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated
strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can
degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording
channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often
attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study
argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording
channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we
propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel
variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with
those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly
improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages,
highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences.
