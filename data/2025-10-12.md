### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了新颖的方法来识别和解释情感不一致性，构建了包含140,750张街景图像和984,024条社交媒体文本的数据集，通过整合物体检测和自然语言处理技术分析北京二环地区2016年和2022年的情感反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入在人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这对城市研究中现有的多维情感分析方法提出了挑战。

Method: 构建街景图像和社交媒体文本数据集，开发反应指数整合物体检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析基于土地利用分布来分类和分析情感反应。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更加均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图显示人类感知和意见情感之间存在显著差异，情感反应变化与密集建筑和行人存在等元素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 不一致性地图展示了疫情前后的感知和意见情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准，通过构建包含异构检索策略和智能体工作流程的真实噪声长上下文，评估LLM的长上下文鲁棒性。实验显示现有模型在智能体测试中仍存在级联失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准过于简化，忽略了现实世界中由有偏检索和智能体工作流程产生的噪声上下文。需要构建更真实的噪声长上下文来测试模型的长上下文鲁棒性。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题。评估异构检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合和图基）对干扰项组成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态的智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验涉及15个长上下文模型：1）更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，但图基重排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败，或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现LLMs在多数语言中无需微调即可达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚未有证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 跨语言方法，与LLMs直接上下文生成词形的方法对比。实验涵盖12种不同形态复杂度的语言。

Result: 研究发现，虽然编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中只需少量示例即可直接生成词形，达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，无需先验微调即可在多数语言中达到最优性能，为低资源语言和领域提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR输出，解决传统WER指标对语义影响小的语法差异过度惩罚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响句子语义的形态和句法差异惩罚过重，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro等先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示来学习评分；同时展示如何微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: Hindi LASER评分与人工标注达到94%的高相关性；Hindi示例对其他印度语言如Marathi、Kannada和Malayalam也有效；微调后LLM预测惩罚类型准确率达89%。

Conclusion: LASER提供了一种更公平的ASR评估方法，LLM的上下文学习和微调能力在不同语言间具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对基于人体骨骼姿势的手语表达评估方法进行了全面研究，涵盖了关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标，分析了不同场景下的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为手语翻译或生成系统开发提供实用且可复现的评估方法，解决手语表达评估的标准化问题。

Method: 通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人类相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿势翻译）来比较关键点距离、嵌入和回译三种评估指标。

Result: 揭示了不同评估指标在不同场景下的权衡关系，开发了开源姿势评估工具包。

Conclusion: 研究结果和开源工具包为手语翻译或生成系统的开发和评估提供了实用且可复现的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于评分标准和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，用于测量民粹主义的思想内容，该方法通过模仿人类编码员训练过程，使大语言模型在民粹主义分类任务上达到与专家人类编码员相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时且难以跨语言、跨情境和大规模语料库扩展，需要开发更高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 利用全球民粹主义数据库，通过评分标准和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，将人类编码员训练文档改编后用于指导大语言模型的推理过程，测试了多个专有和开源模型。

Result: 该领域特定的提示策略使大语言模型在民粹主义分类任务上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微差别和情境敏感性。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准和锚点引导的思维链提示方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种高效、可扩展的替代方案，大语言模型在此任务上表现出与人类专家相当的分类能力。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过将多智能体系统提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product置信传播算法来解决，实现了自动化的多智能体提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出四阶段MAPRO框架：1) 将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题；2) 使用语言引导的max-product置信传播算法求解；3) 采用拓扑感知的精炼机制，整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示；4) 迭代收敛到协调的智能体特定提示策略。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统性能，其基于最大后验的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放任务中实现高效推理，减少时间开销同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度标记选择，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含两个核心组件：轻量级时序回归模块预测下一标记查询状态；异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，达到理论最优时间每输出标记。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，同时在多个TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除了顺序依赖，为高并发和长思维链场景下的LLM推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究多智能体系统中团队结构、多样性和互动动态对性能的影响，发现扁平团队优于层级团队，多样性影响复杂，智能体存在过度自信但反思显示协作价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类团队科学启发，探索LLM驱动的多智能体系统的团队动态，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在常识推理（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA）和社会推理（Social IQa、Latent Implicit Hate）四个任务中的表现，分析结构、多样性和互动动态。

Result: 扁平团队性能优于层级团队；多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队性能过度自信；反思显示协作价值但存在整合挑战和对话协调问题。

Conclusion: 团队结构设计对多智能体系统性能至关重要，扁平结构更有效；需要解决智能体过度自信和协作整合问题以提升团队效能。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Thought Template框架，通过可重用的思维缓存来改进长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，在检索和无检索设置下都优于强基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但简单堆叠文档无法有效连接证据，需要结构化方法来指导多跳推理。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理过程重构为可重用的思维缓存，通过自然语言反馈迭代优化模板，并可将优化后的模板蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线都取得了持续提升，展示了广泛的适用性和透明推理复用能力。

Conclusion: Thought Template框架有效解决了长上下文模型中证据连接问题，为知识密集型多跳推理提供了结构化解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，通过整合所有可用数据集并在多个领域进行训练，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语作为双语种语言，在阿富汗和伊朗使用波斯-阿拉伯字母，在塔吉克斯坦使用塔吉克-西里尔字母。虽然各国方言相似，但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家之间的书面交流。现有音译模型大多局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了序列到序列的音译模型，整合了所有可用数据集，并新增了两个数据集进行跨领域训练。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向达到chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，Tajik到Farsi方向达到chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04，设定了全面的基准指标。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了跨领域音译的清晰理解，建立了可比较的领先基准，解决了波斯语不同文字系统间的音译问题。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了OWL模型，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文中的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，例如EAGLE3甚至使生成速度降低了0.81倍。

Method: 1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖最后一个token状态，使其能泛化到各种长度；2) 验证器中使用特殊token [SPEC]为drafter生成更丰富的表示；3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上实现了比EAGLE3约5倍更高的接受长度，同时发布了新的长上下文基准测试LongSpecBench。

Conclusion: OWL通过三项创新有效解决了推测解码在长上下文中的性能问题，并发布了所有代码和数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

Motivation: 解决小参数视觉语言模型（≤2B）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器性能较差的问题，使其能在资源受限环境中实际应用。

Method: 1. 多标准提示：将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；2. 领域自适应迁移学习：在图表数据集上使用合成判断微调2B参数LVLM，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性差距，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动平台部署NLP模型需要适应性强且高效的模型，但多任务预微调存在优化信号冲突问题

Method: 使用共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架

Result: 在21个下游任务上，NER平均提升0.8%，文本分类平均提升8.8%

Conclusion: 该方法在满足实际部署约束的同时，实现了与单独预微调相当的性能

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析发现，COVID-19健康谣言在语言特征上与真实信息存在显著差异：可读性更低、恐惧相关词汇使用频率是其他数据集的两倍以上、感叹号使用最少，采用复杂修辞风格结合情感暗示来增强可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康谣言与真实信息在语言特征上的差异，为数字健康谣言的检测提供语言学指标，并指导公共卫生信息传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库（COVID-19谣言7588条、一般COVID-19内容10700条、猴痘相关帖子5787条）进行对比分析，考察可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用的差异。

Result: COVID-19谣言的可读性得分显著较低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用最少，呈现出复杂修辞风格与情感暗示相结合的特征。

Conclusion: 健康谣言采用特定的语言策略来增强可信度，这些语言学特征可用于谣言检测。研究存在使用传统可读性指标、有限情感词典等局限性，未来研究应纳入纵向设计、更广泛情感词典和平台敏感方法。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发构造语言的系统，通过模块化方法创建语音学模型、生成语法标记、构建词典、设计正字法，并编写语法手册。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一是为构造人工语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度，以及应用于从高资源语言到低资源语言的翻译。

Method: 模块化系统：1) 代理方法创建目标语音学模型；2) 将英语句子翻译为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记；3) 从翻译语料构建词典；4) 设计正字法；5) 编写语法手册。

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范之间存在能力差距，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易。在低资源语言翻译方面结果多为负面，但改进系统可能带来实际收益。

Conclusion: LLMs在构造语言开发中可作为有用工具，展示了其对语言概念的理解，但在处理罕见语言模式和低资源语言翻译方面仍有局限性。

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究使用表征相似性分析探索了语言模型输入词汇表征的结构及其在训练过程中的演化，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关，且高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表征的结构特征及其在训练过程中的动态演化，理解词汇嵌入几何如何围绕语言结构组织。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型进行实验，将输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、语法和频率指标在训练过程中进行相关性分析。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和语法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量，后者仍保留随机初始化偏差的某些对齐。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能的不同作用，为进一步研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型训练中特定能力增益提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，且基于精确匹配的评估方法忽略了层次结构接近但错误的编码错误，这些错误在实际应用中影响重大。

Method: 采用轻量级干预策略，包括提示工程和小规模微调，避免计算密集型搜索方法。引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并发布了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 验证步骤被证明是提高基于LLM的医学编码的有效且可靠的方法，能够显著减少层次结构接近的错误编码。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进LLM医学编码性能的关键步骤，轻量级干预策略在保持计算效率的同时提高了准确性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，评估了三种方法在访问控制策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大型语言模型经常通过产生不受限制的响应来模糊角色边界。需要研究LLM在授权时回答、未授权时拒绝的能力。

Method: 创建了带有PostgreSQL角色策略的新数据集，比较了三种方法：零/少样本提示、两步生成-验证管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，而微调在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。更复杂策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证和微调都能改善LLM的访问控制能力，但复杂策略仍然是挑战。发布了RBAC增强数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统银行助手仅限于咨询或支持角色，无法执行核心金融交易。Ryt AI旨在通过自然语言界面实现监管批准的、可靠的核心金融操作。

Method: 使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ）协调单一对话，每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，结合确定性护栏、人工确认和无状态审计架构。

Result: 成功实现了监管批准的自然语言界面，能够在严格治理下可靠支持核心金融操作，展示了"正确银行业务"的可行性。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面可以可靠地作为主要银行接口执行核心金融交易，代表了银行业AI应用的重要突破。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于注意力权重的启发式方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存淘汰方法使用基于注意力权重的启发式策略，没有考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响，导致内存效率不高。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于OBD理论推导闭式解来量化token重要性，考虑键、值和联合键值对的影响。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有方法的启发式分数能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一种原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的token重要性评估显著优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于token概率的偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被批评与现实语言模型使用场景和危害脱节，因此需要探索更现实的替代评估指标。

Method: 测试自然语言推理作为更现实的偏见评估指标，比较NLI指标与TP指标之间的相关性和行为差异。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI指标更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感脆弱。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和复杂场景覆盖不足的挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范缺陷。

Method: 使用综合分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在无法同时满足的合法原则之间做出选择。通过价值分类分数评估12个前沿LLM的行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，实证表明这种高分歧强烈预测模型规范中的潜在问题。发现当前模型规范存在直接矛盾和解释模糊等问题。

Conclusion: 模型行为的高度分歧反映了模型规范中的根本问题，需要改进规范设计以减少原则冲突和解释模糊性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言特征，难以有效泛化到不同风格变化。隐性仇恨言论通过讽刺、刻板印象等方式表达，更难检测。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能产生虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为因果图，涉及环境、动机、目标和风格等关键因素。提出CADET框架，解构仇恨言论为可解释的潜在因素，控制混杂变量，并通过在潜在空间中对风格进行干预实现反事实推理。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架能够有效提高仇恨言论检测的泛化能力，通过解构和干预潜在因素来识别不同形式的仇恨言论。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本反馈，这为深度个性化提供了机会。现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态变化的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户整个文本历史编织成分层记忆，包含两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆（捕获具体用户行为）和认知记忆（表示长期偏好），两者都整合了时间和语义信息但在不同抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过分层记忆结构成功捕获了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为大型语言模型提供了统一的用户表示，使其能够在具体行为和抽象特征上进行推理。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

*Jiaoyang Li,Junhao Ruan,Shengwei Tang,Saihan Chen,Kaiyan Chang,Yuan Ge,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubQRAG是一个子问题驱动的图检索增强生成框架，通过将复杂问题分解为可验证的子问题链，动态扩展知识图谱，构建结构化可追溯的证据路径，显著提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Graph RAG虽然能构建知识图谱连接文档中的事实，但在复杂多跳问答中缺乏深度结构化推理，导致证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序子问题链，为每个子问题检索相关三元组，在现有图谱不足时实时从源文档动态扩展，聚合所有推理三元组形成"图记忆"。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG取得了一致且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数上表现突出。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的动态图谱扩展和结构化证据路径，有效解决了复杂多跳问答中的推理深度不足问题。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的多语言知识图谱补全框架，通过知识级分组混合专家和迭代实体重排序来利用跨语言共享知识，在5种语言的数据集上相比现有最佳方法有明显提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKGC研究未能充分利用LLMs的多语言能力，忽略了跨语言知识的可共享性，需要开发能有效建模和利用多语言共享知识的框架。

Method: 提出KL-GMoE（知识级分组混合专家）来高效建模共享知识，以及IER（迭代实体重排序）来显著增强共享知识的利用效率。

Result: 在包含5种语言的mKG数据集上，相比现有SOTA MKGC方法，在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别提升了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了多语言知识图谱补全性能，并揭示了在未见语言和不平衡语言设置下知识共享的特性，相关数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

*Fu Chen,Peng Wang,Xiyin Li,Wen Li,Shichi Lei,Dongdong Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolExpander框架通过动态多轮硬采样和自示例思维两个创新，解决了GRPO训练中模型响应不准确和训练崩溃的问题，显著提升了小规模LLM的工具使用能力和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练LLM时面临模型响应不准确、性能提升有限、训练中期崩溃等问题，特别是在小规模架构中表现更差，这限制了GRPO的潜力发挥。

Method: 提出ToolExpander框架：1) 动态多轮硬采样 - 用高质量少样本演示动态替换困难样本，配合指数学习率衰减；2) 自示例思维 - 改进的GRPO框架，去除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，让模型自主生成和分析少样本示例。

Result: 实验结果表明ToolExpander显著提升了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander通过创新的采样和思维机制，有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了稳定高效的工具导向强化学习方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

*Tianci Liu,Ran Xu,Tony Yu,Ilgee Hong,Carl Yang,Tuo Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了OpenRubrics，一个大规模(prompt, rubric)对数据集，用于训练rubric生成和基于rubric的奖励模型。通过对比性rubric生成和拒绝采样方法，提升了奖励模型的性能，在多个基准测试中超越了基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型主要依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性。虽然已有研究探索使用结构化自然语言标准（rubrics）作为奖励，但生成可靠且可扩展的rubrics仍然是一个关键挑战。

Method: 1. 构建OpenRubrics数据集；2. 引入对比性rubric生成(CRG)，通过对比偏好和被拒绝的响应来推导硬规则和原则；3. 通过拒绝采样强制偏好标签一致性来移除噪声rubrics。

Result: 基于rubric的奖励模型Rubric-RM在多个奖励建模基准测试中超越了强基线模型6.8%。这些收益在指令遵循和生物医学基准测试的政策模型中也得到了转移。

Conclusion: Rubrics提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估和自动奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了一种新的原则驱动范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展方法，通过引入两种随机采样策略和潜在奖励模型来解决连续空间中的采样和轨迹聚合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的并行测试时扩展方法主要针对显式链式思维，而潜在推理模型在连续向量空间中进行推理，缺乏采样机制和概率信号，无法有效利用并行扩展的优势。

Method: 提出两种不确定性启发的随机采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和高斯加性噪声；设计潜在奖励模型，通过步级对比目标训练来评分和指导潜在推理。

Result: 实验表明两种采样策略都能有效扩展计算能力并展现不同的探索动态，潜在奖励模型能够有效选择推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，实现了潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLMs在多项选择题中的推理策略，发现即使只有选项输入，LLMs也能通过推理获得成功，这挑战了部分输入成功总是缺陷的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在MCQA任务中的真实推理策略，特别是验证部分输入成功是否总是问题，以及推理轨迹是否能揭示这些策略的深度。

Method: 让推理LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性，测试推理对准确率的影响。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅选项情况下提升准确率；仅选项成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示使用较少问题的策略如推断缺失问题。

Conclusion: 部分输入成功并非总是缺陷，推理轨迹可用于区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Conclusion: 提出的系统方法成功将大量问题特定工具转化为少量功能强大的聚合工具，解决了工具库扩展时的检索瓶颈，为工具增强推理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 论文发现基于结果的奖励训练数学推理大语言模型容易导致奖励欺骗，产生虚假正例。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型，通过评估整个推理轨迹来提升模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学推理模型通常使用基于结果的奖励训练，只关注最终答案，这容易导致奖励欺骗问题，模型可能通过不合理的推理过程得到正确答案，从而高估模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，基于问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的强化学习训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督学习。在AIME2024上，Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，Miracle Steps的发生率降低了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要，过程导向的奖励能够有效缓解奖励欺骗问题，提升模型的真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM幻觉的检测和缓解，但忽视了增强真实性可能对安全对齐产生的负面影响，即提高事实准确性往往以削弱拒绝行为为代价。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分离拒绝相关特征与幻觉特征，通过子空间正交化在微调过程中保持拒绝行为，防止幻觉增加的同时维持安全对齐。

Result: 在常识推理任务和有害基准测试（AdvBench和StrongReject）上的评估表明，该方法能有效保持拒绝行为和任务效用，缓解真实性与安全性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了LLM中真实性与安全性的权衡问题，通过特征分离和正交化技术同时保持了模型的真实性和安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Conclusion: 该方法通过端到端的联合学习和标签知识传播，有效提升了少样本多标签意图检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多轮对话中的上下文漂移问题，提出了一个动态框架来理解和控制这种漂移现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现优异，但在实际多轮交互中会出现上下文漂移问题，即模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为，现有静态评估指标难以捕捉这种时间演化问题。

Method: 将漂移形式化为测试模型与目标一致参考模型之间逐轮的KL散度，提出一个递归模型将漂移演化解释为具有恢复力和可控干预的有界随机过程。

Result: 实验显示上下文漂移呈现稳定的噪声限制平衡态而非失控退化，简单的提醒干预能可靠地减少分歧，符合理论预测。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的平衡现象而非不可避免的衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝过程中使用少量校准数据会导致输出不匹配，直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合并破坏预训练权重，需要一种更好的误差补偿方法。

Method: 使用旋转约束更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性，同时设计方差感知重要性评分来优先保留对主方向影响大的维度。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B模型上应用该方法，在WikiText-2和多个语言理解基准测试中，困惑度和任务准确率均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 旋转约束补偿方法能有效解决剪枝误差问题，在保持几何特性的同时提高模型性能，为LLM剪枝提供了有效的后处理方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to
transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning,

remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation

agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,

TL;DR: HiPRAG是一种通过分层过程奖励来优化agentic RAG搜索行为的训练方法，解决了过度搜索和搜索不足的问题，在提高准确率的同时显著提升了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RL的训练方法缺乏细粒度控制，导致agentic RAG存在过度搜索（检索已知信息）和搜索不足（必要时不搜索）的问题，造成不必要开销和不可靠输出。

Method: 引入分层过程奖励，将智能体的推理轨迹分解为离散可解析步骤，实时评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在传统结果和格式奖励基础上增加基于最优搜索和非搜索步骤比例的额外奖励。

Result: 在7个多样化QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型达到65.4%（3B）和67.2%（7B）的平均准确率，同时将过度搜索率降至2.3%，并降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: 优化推理过程本身而不仅仅是最终结果对于提高搜索智能体的效率和最优性具有重要意义，HiPRAG展示了通过RL进行细粒度控制的潜力和重要性。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为GTD的生成框架，用于优化LLM驱动的多智能体系统的通信拓扑结构，通过迭代构建过程生成任务自适应的拓扑，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统的效率很大程度上取决于通信拓扑结构，但设计最优拓扑具有挑战性，需要在任务性能、通信成本和鲁棒性之间平衡。现有静态或手工设计的拓扑无法适应不同任务需求。

Method: GTD框架基于条件离散图扩散模型，将拓扑合成建模为迭代构建过程，每个步骤由轻量级代理模型引导，预测多目标奖励（如准确性、效用、成本），实现实时、无梯度的优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，GTD能够生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM智能体协作方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导合成过程，能够更好地处理复杂的设计权衡，为多智能体系统生成优化的通信拓扑结构。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出MGR-CSC框架解决多语言生成式检索中的跨语言标识符错位和膨胀问题，通过语义压缩统一多语言关键词，提升检索准确性和解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀两大挑战，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架：1）将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义；2）压缩标识符空间；3）在检索时采用动态多步约束解码策略。

Result: 在mMarco100k数据集上检索准确率提升6.83%，在mNQ320k上提升4.77%；文档标识符长度分别减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成式检索的核心问题，在提升检索准确率的同时显著降低了标识符长度，实现了高效的多语言检索。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过动态结合在线和离线策略生成，在令牌级别选择性整合教师指导，解决了小型语言模型性能提升的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在延迟和计算约束应用中至关重要，但现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：离线策略蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，而在线策略方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，在令牌级别动态结合在线和离线策略生成，让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两种教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小型语言模型提供了实用有效的方法。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小型语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了可行的解决方案，且额外开销可接受。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Method: 开发了统一的评估框架和数据集，使用多种指标对24种双向语言对进行多领域基准测试，并提出结合规则启发式、语义相似性过滤和LLM验证的混合偏见检测流程。

Result: 创建了基于1,439个翻译-参考对人工评估的高质量偏见标注数据集，代码和数据集已在GitHub开源。

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为评估LLM翻译质量和公平性提供了系统框架，有助于识别和缓解翻译中的偏见问题。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 本文提出了TRACE分析框架，系统研究LLMs中的"过度思考"问题，发现过度验证和过度探索是主要原因，并提出基于效用的过度思考定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使简单查询也进行过度推理，造成计算资源浪费且无精度提升。现有研究缺乏对过度思考根本原因的系统分析。

Method: 开发TRACE分析框架：首先将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维，通过推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图，识别相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 基准测试证实长思维模型在简单任务上慢5-20倍且无实质增益。分析发现开放权重思维模型主要有两种模式：探索者模式和晚期着陆模式，表明过度验证和过度探索是过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 基于思维结构提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了基于长度的度量标准，为理解LLMs思维进展和原则性过度思考管理提供了更深入的见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的发展推动了语音交互系统的进步，但现有模型在语言对齐方面存在不足，特别是在代码切换场景下性能显著下降。

Method: 提出Chain of Recognition (CoR)来增强理解能力，使用Keyword Highlighting (KH)来指导生成，通过数据构建和训练方法改进语言对齐能力。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统弱到强泛化方法受限于弱模型输出的噪声和偏差，影响其鲁棒性和泛化能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用隐式奖励（通过对数似然比近似显式奖励）与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在预对齐和对齐后弱模型间进行对比解码。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果证实了一致的改进，显示了ConG的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化，为通向AGI提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了从标准德语到德语方言的跨方言迁移在文本模型、语音模型和级联系统中的表现，发现语音模型在方言数据上效果最佳，而文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写会在文本处理中造成问题，因此需要研究在语音和文本不同设置下的跨方言迁移效果。

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较了文本模型、语音模型以及语音转录后再处理的级联系统三种设置。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上效果最好。级联系统在德语上落后于文本模型，但在方言数据上如果转录系统能生成标准化的输出，则表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 语音模型是处理方言数据的有效方法，而级联系统在方言处理中也有一定潜力，特别是当转录系统能产生标准化输出时。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench为LLMs的详细指令理解能力提供了客观的评估框架，填补了现有基准测试的空白。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现显著衰减，特别是在涉及推理链中隐含中间主题时。这源于对链式知识在神经元层面如何动态表示和利用的忽视。

Method: 通过因果分析发现多跳推理中隐含主题作为查询神经元，在Transformer层间顺序激活对应值神经元来积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键的查询-值通路。

Result: 在GPT-J上比现有最优方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析进一步揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，表明值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的积累过程协调的。

Conclusion: 这些发现基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Conclusion: 该框架已成功在大型电商企业的真实培训和认证考试中部署应用。

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成内容时经常产生不完整或选择性忽略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动化评估方法：基于NLI的方法（将文本分解为原子陈述并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接）、基于Q&A的方法（提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应）、端到端方法（直接使用LLM识别缺失内容）。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有出人意料的良好效果，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本完整性方面表现有效，但需要在效果与鲁棒性、可解释性之间权衡。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用大语言模型处理17-18世纪爱沙尼亚语词典的潜力，包括丰富历史词典内容、识别哥特体文字以及创建统一数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对爱沙尼亚语等小语种历史文献数字化和研究的资源限制，探索LLMs在节省时间和成本方面的应用价值。

Method: 采用三种方法：使用Claude 3.7 Sonnet为历史词典提供现代词形和意义；使用视觉LLMs识别哥特体文字；采用重叠分块扫描和双LLM协作进行文本识别和结构化输出合并。

Result: 在Gutslaff 1648词典实验中，81%的词条获得了准确的意义和现代对应词；在Helle 1732词典的文本识别中，41%的词条被无错误地识别并结构化；Hupel 1780语法词典采用分块扫描和双LLM处理。

Conclusion: 即使对于小语种，LLMs在节省时间和财务资源方面具有显著潜力，能够有效支持历史文献的数字化和研究工作。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过自动检测模糊问题、收集替代答案，并使用强化学习优化模型，在开放域问答中处理多答案问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模型在处理允许多个有效答案的模糊问题时表现不佳，标准问答基准通常假设单一正确答案，无法提供合适的训练信号。现有处理模糊性的方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 使用自动管道检测模糊问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励通过强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在八个开放域问答基准测试中，A²Search实现了新的最先进性能。A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中的平均AnsF1@1得分为48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决模糊性问题并在不同基准测试中泛化，表明接受模糊性对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个创新框架，通过让小语言模型(SLM)揭示大语言模型(LLM)的高价值推理时刻，实现资源高效的知识蒸馏，显著提升推理性能同时大幅降低训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源消耗大，需要大量标注数据和统一优化所有token，但实际上只有少量token具有学习价值。本文探索反直觉思路：能否让小模型通过行为差异揭示大模型独特的推理优势？

Method: LightReasoner采用两阶段框架：1)采样阶段通过专家-业余模型对比识别关键推理时刻并构建监督样本；2)微调阶段基于这些蒸馏样本对齐专家模型，放大其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%时间消耗、80%采样问题和99%调优token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱SLM转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为推进LLM推理提供了可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型在社会推理任务中存在困难，提出了一种自适应世界模型增强推理机制来解决这一问题，显著提升了社会推理准确性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社会推理任务中却表现不佳，经常出现认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及混淆客观世界状态与主观信念状态的问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社会基准测试中显示出显著改进，准确率提升（如在Hi-ToM中+10%），同时计算成本降低（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交情境中部署大语言模型提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，通过模仿人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式，解决了模型的社会推理困难。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要同时具备准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法难以兼顾这两方面。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段通过上下文过滤、DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化及标题候选选择；第二阶段使用少量样本提示和作者档案图进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本和通用优化方法，ROUGE-1召回率提升+8.3%，精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；风格精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在测试时是静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏知识积累和持续改进能力，限制了在真实世界长时程任务中的应用。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，采用分层记忆模块组织多级经验，通过任务执行后的自主反思将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验，实现持续学习和自我进化。

Result: 在TAC生产力基准测试中，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就取得了显著领先的SOTA性能，展示了强大的持续学习和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MUSE为能够实现真实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理建立了新范式，证明了经验驱动的自我进化系统的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中的潜力，比较不同提示策略的效果，并与商业翻译引擎进行性能对比。

Method: 使用简单和增强提示策略，进行文档级和句子级翻译对比，采用自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估方法。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在自动评估中表现更好，但ChatGPT-4在流畅性方面更优；ChatGPT与知名翻译系统竞争力相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中具有竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，不同版本在准确性和流畅性方面存在权衡。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能编码非平凡的气候结构但存在空间一致误差，特别是在高海拔和高纬度地区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性和错误信息风险评估至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分表征。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，要求模型回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证。

Result: LLMs能捕获纬度和地形模式，RMSE为3-6°C，偏差±1°C，但在1500米以上海拔性能急剧下降（RMSE 5-13°C vs 2-4°C）。包含地理上下文可减少27%误差。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕获当前气候分布，但无法再现温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出高级推理能力，但传统的对齐方法主要依赖仅判断最终结果的结果奖励模型(ORMs)。过程奖励模型(PRMs)通过评估和指导推理过程中的步骤或轨迹来弥补这一差距。

Method: 通过完整的循环系统概述PRMs：如何生成过程数据、构建PRMs、以及使用PRMs进行测试时扩展和强化学习。总结了在数学、代码、文本、多模态推理、机器人技术和智能体等领域的应用，并回顾了新兴基准。

Conclusion: PRMs通过细粒度的过程评估，为实现更精细、鲁棒的推理对齐提供了重要方向，需要进一步研究来解决现有挑战。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future

Motivation: 传统集中式或全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间存在平衡难题，联邦学习虽然提供了分布式解决方案，但现有方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，且多轮训练后容易遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE策略，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度评分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合机制，有效解决了联邦学习中过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，为平衡隐私保护与个性化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Method: 采用自我博弈设置，在三种不同对话游戏中测试商业和开源LLM，分析推理对性能、成本和语言一致性的影响。

Result: 推理显著改善谈判结果（GPT-5性能提升31.4%），但计算成本增加近400%。开源模型在德语和意大利语谈判中会切换至英语进行内部推理，而商业模型能保持语言一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能有效提升LLM谈判能力但成本高昂，多语言推理中存在语言不一致问题，这对通过推理痕迹实现可解释性构成挑战。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过最大公共词汇表将给定自回归语言模型高效转换为任意小词汇量的模型。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架为不同语言模型的协作提供了理论基础和实用方法，解决了词汇表差异带来的协作障碍。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理常见错误的分类法，推进了影响者营销内容的透明检测，并展示了如何支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核过程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 提出CLoVE和GloVE方法从LLM-as-a-Judge中提取概念化全局策略，用于理解LLM评估文本时的潜在偏见和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评估工具被大规模使用来替代人工标注，需要理解其潜在偏见和风险。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个内容危害检测基准数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM-as-a-Judge决策具有高忠实度，且对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度良好，该方法有助于提高LLM评估的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

TL;DR: Genii是一个无监督多智能体协作优化框架，通过模拟客户端-服务器轮询机制来减轻LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，无需人工标注即可超越有监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏向自身生成的回答，这影响了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制进行无监督优化。

Result: Genii在实验中表现优于基于标注判断数据训练的有监督模型，即使使用较弱模型作为服务器代理也能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Genii有效减轻了LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性，且所有代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes
are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/Genii.

Method: 从历史客服对话中提取问答对自动构建知识库，使用轻量级LLaMA-3.1-8B模型在内部数据上进行微调。

Result: 在20家公司评估中，系统在回答信息查询问题时达到90%以上准确率，性能优于更大的闭源LLM。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型LLM推理成本高，小型LLM缺乏跨领域零样本指令跟随能力，传统微调方法导致灾难性遗忘，限制了模型对动态用户需求的适应性。

Method: DACIP-RC通过阅读理解方式生成多样化任务指令和响应，基于对话记录进行持续预训练，替代传统的下一词预测方法。

Result: 实证评估显示DACIP-RC显著提升了在会议摘要、行动项生成、通话目的识别等商业对话任务中的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业如何利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两个基准测试(XSB和MS-XSB)来评估LLM的过度安全拒绝问题，并开发了三种无需重新训练的方法来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常对包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求产生错误的拒绝，这种过度安全拒绝问题影响了模型的实用性。

Method: 1) 创建单轮对话的XSB基准和多轮对话的MS-XSB基准；2) 使用后验解释方法识别拒绝触发词；3) 部署三种轻量级方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验表明这些策略在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了对安全提示的遵从性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可复现的诊断和缓解过度安全拒绝的框架，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在简单任务上"过度思考"、生成不必要冗长推理的问题，现有方法通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: 使用强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，集成视觉理解和可执行代码到推理中，支持多模态应用。

Result: 在保持与传统GRPO训练推理模型相当性能的同时，平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2通过自适应推理框架有效平衡了性能与效率，验证了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，而韵律诗歌这种具有严格音节和音素模式约束的高级文学形式，为深入探究LLM的推理能力和语言理解提供了机会。

Method: 开发了MetricalARGS分类法，将诗歌相关NLP任务分为分析、检索、生成和支持四个维度，并以泰卢固语为例展示该分类法的实际应用。

Result: 创建了首个专门针对韵律诗歌的NLP任务分类体系，为评估LLM在遵循严格规则和前提条件方面的能力提供了系统框架。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS分类法通过韵律诗歌的视角，为理解当前LLM的能力和局限性开辟了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Motivation: 解决LLM在专业领域性能下降的问题，传统方法依赖昂贵的参数更新且容易过拟合，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 使用训练免费的组相对策略优化，基于组内相对语义优势而非数值优势，在多轮学习中迭代提炼高质量经验知识作为token先验。

Result: 在数学推理和网络搜索任务上，仅用几十个训练样本就能显著提升DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus的跨域性能，优于经过微调的小型LLM。

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的方法，能够有效解决数据稀缺和过拟合问题，为LLM代理在专业领域的应用提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚，需要理论解释。

Method: 使用二分图分析验证函数令牌激活大部分特征，通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测。

Result: 实验证明少量函数令牌激活了大部分特征，预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导，迫使函数令牌选择最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，函数令牌在记忆检索和巩固中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索涌现性错位现象是否能够超越安全行为，扩展到高风险场景下的不诚实和欺骗行为领域，如压力下撒谎和欺骗行为。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行错位补全的微调，包括下游混合微调设置和模拟良性/偏见用户的人机交互环境。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs在诚实性方面表现出广泛的错位行为，仅引入1%的错位数据就能使诚实行为减少20%以上，在10%偏见用户群体下助手LLM会被无意错位加剧不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 涌现性错位风险不仅通过直接微调产生，也会在下游混合任务和实际人机交互中出现，需要关注LLMs在高风险场景下的不诚实和欺骗行为风险。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽视反因果关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取数据集只关注支持因果关系的声明，完全忽略了反驳因果关系的反因果声明，甚至错误地将反因果声明标注为支持因果关系的声明。

Method: 基于广泛的文献综述，开发了严谨的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上增加了反因果声明，获得了较高的标注者间一致性（Cohen's κ=0.74）。

Result: 研究表明，在没有反因果关系的训练数据下，模型倾向于将反因果声明错误分类为支持因果关系的声明。基于新数据集，可以缓解这一错误，使transformer模型能够有效区分支持和反驳因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于准确的因果提取至关重要，新数据集能够显著提高模型区分支持和反驳因果关系的能力。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练，在保持模型有用性的同时提升安全性，减少不安全回复和过度拒绝问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐方法存在两个问题：容易受到对抗攻击产生不安全内容，以及对良性但敏感提示过度拒绝。现有安全防护模型完全拒绝包含不安全部分的内容，这会加剧过度拒绝问题且无法提供细致指导。

Method: 提出WaltzRL框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，后者提供改进建议。核心是动态改进奖励(DIR)，基于对话智能体整合反馈的程度随时间演化。推理时改进而非丢弃不安全或过度拒绝的回复。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全回复（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，WaltzRL在保持通用能力的同时增强了LLM安全性，推进了有用性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 使用对比解码方法生成合成数据，并将其与原始数据混合训练，可以提高语言建模性能和下游任务表现，特别是对需要推理能力的任务有益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练所需的大量文本数据可能即将达到极限，使用LLM生成的合成数据是一个潜在解决方案。

Method: 在受控环境中，使用对比解码方法从好模型和坏模型的相对差异中采样合成语料库，然后将合成数据与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据混合训练下，语言建模目标和一系列下游任务的性能都有所提升。对比解码生成的合成数据特别有助于需要推理技能的任务。

Conclusion: 使用对比解码生成合成数据并与真实数据混合训练是提升模型性能的有效方法，尤其能改善模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过强化学习激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，引入高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口，在多个搜索代理基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在长序列交互的多轮智能体中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理问题。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制消除对外部摘要模型的依赖。

Result: DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源代理提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中表现一致改进，支持近100轮持续交互。

Conclusion: DeepMiner有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，显著提升了智能体的深度推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层中，占比不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对通用自然语言理解影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解变得重要。然而，LLMs表现出文化偏见和对代表性不足文化的有限认知，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 识别出的神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，占比不到1%。抑制这些神经元会使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，而通用NLU基准测试性能基本不受影响。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练NLU基准测试可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为LLMs的内部机制提供了洞见，并为模型训练和工程提供了实践指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的对抗指令生成和反思循环来提升攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的LLM安全评估方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。引入验证器评估提示危害性而无需查询目标模型。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard两个红队数据集，在八个SOTA LLM上评估，相比基线方法获得更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 种子方法的局限性凸显了自由形式红队在LLM安全评估中的潜力，将开源数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，平衡效率与鲁棒性：第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段对模糊输入采用LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀率上升需要主动预防策略，社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测隐含自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺等间接表达）仍具挑战性。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT分类器处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段对模糊输入，采用多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取的心理特征ML集成。

Result: 在两个互补数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐含案例99.7%，跨领域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率与鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中演示表示和学习能力之间的关系，发现两者是正交的：演示表示决定基线准确率，而学习能力则在此基础上独立提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示的重要性，但对学习能力的研究结果不一。本文旨在探究演示表示和学习能力这两个方面的相互作用关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后在每个标签集上使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的影响。演示表示的质量优势在学习过程中保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中的演示表示和学习能力具有独立效应，这一发现揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大语言模型对条件陈述可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但与人类相比不够一致，且模型规模增大并不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，不清楚它们如何判断条件陈述的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: LLMs对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致；模型规模增大不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义信息，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是改善与人类一致性的关键因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Result: 在10M token上实现数量级更高的训练效率，在SuperGLUE任务中零样本和微调性能均优于GPT-2和GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考主流深度学习范式和相关的扩展定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 现有多模态大推理模型在简单问题上产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案，需要平衡推理效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：自适应冷启动阶段根据问题难度生成相应长度的推理轨迹；第二阶段使用自适应熵策略优化，利用高窗口熵标记作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制来决定探索程度。

Result: ARES在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效平衡了简单和困难问题的处理，提高了多模态大模型的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Motivation: AI模型应该能够识别人类判断中的变异和分歧，LEWIDI系列任务旨在通过提供合适的数据集和开发评估方法来促进这种训练和评估方法。

Method: 扩展LEWIDI基准到四个数据集（释义识别、反讽检测、讽刺检测、自然语言推理），采用两种评估范式：软标签方法和视角主义方法，并测试新的评估指标。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性，为分歧感知技术提供了新的资源、基准和发现。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的地位，支持了分歧感知技术的发展。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但会导致超过80%的推理轨迹产生相同最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 使用经过焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型来预测答案等价性，结合在线贪心聚类算法动态剪枝冗余路径，同时保持答案多样性。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 人类在有新概念需求时会创造新词，作者希望探索类似方法用于与LLMs的交流，以更好地理解和控制模型行为。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练模型理解新概念，使用自我言语化让模型描述新词含义，并通过插件评估验证言语化的有效性。

Result: 新词学习可以控制概念如奉承、错误答案、文本长度等，发现机器专用同义词，并能同时学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 新词学习是一种有效的模型理解和控制方法，能够扩展模型的概念表达能力，并为模型行为分析提供新视角。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a

Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient

propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，RLKV在20-50%缓存减少的情况下性能接近无损，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLKV通过强化学习识别推理关键头，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，在保持推理质量的同时显著减少内存开销。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个新型多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的互动讨论生成内在奖励，实现无外部监督的自主进化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖外部奖励或LLM内部奖励，与人类通过讨论协作实现自我进化的机制不符。

Method: 基于多智能体互动讨论生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制制定奖励，通过RL优化各智能体策略。

Result: CoMAS在大多数评估设置中表现优于未训练智能体并达到最先进水平，展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自我进化提供了一种新颖有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来应对训练数据泄露问题，保持基准测试的有效性和可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试面临训练数据泄露问题，模型可能通过记忆而非真正泛化能力来获得高分，这扭曲了模型比较和进展评估。需要一种方法来持续更新基准测试以保持其有效性。

Method: ArenaBencher框架通过推断测试案例核心能力、生成保持原始目标的候选问答对、使用LLM作为评判者验证正确性和意图、聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例，通过上下文演示迭代生成更具挑战性的诊断案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用ArenaBencher，产生了经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，发现了新的失败模式，在保持测试目标对齐的同时增加了难度，并改善了模型可区分性。

Conclusion: 该框架为持续演进基准测试提供了可扩展的路径，能够跟上基础模型的快速发展步伐。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB数据标签有限的挑战，需要开发能够在真实数据上严格评估的实时检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成/真实训练样本的智能权重策略，同时使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，保持实时性能，验证了各模块贡献度，并测试了极端光照和海况下的系统表现。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，有效提升了海上小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

TL;DR: DynamicEval是一个新的文本到视频评估基准，专注于动态相机运动评估，包含45k人工标注和新的背景/前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级评估上都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：缺乏对动态相机运动的关注，以及过度依赖模型级聚合而忽视视频级评估。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，收集45k人工标注，提出新的背景一致性指标（修正遮挡问题）和前景一致性指标（跟踪对象实例内的点）。

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，提升超过2个百分点。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

TL;DR: RISP是一种改进的RED算法，通过重启惯性机制加速收敛，同时保持基于分数的图像先验以获得高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速通常依赖启发式方法。需要一种既能快速收敛又能保证高质量重建的算法。

Method: RISP在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，结合基于分数的图像先验，并建立了相应的连续时间动力学系统分析。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，实验表明在多种成像逆问题中都能实现快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制成功解决了成像逆问题中收敛速度与重建质量的平衡问题，为相关算法提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图像纯化策略的超低剂量CT去噪框架，通过生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，并配合频域流匹配模型，有效解决了真实临床uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT(uLDCT)虽然显著降低了辐射暴露，但引入了严重的噪声和伪影，并且导致uLDCT与正常剂量CT(NDCT)图像对之间存在显著的空间不对齐问题，这使得现有基于合成噪声或对齐数据训练的去噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 首先构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，然后提出图像纯化(IP)策略生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，为网络训练提供高质量数据基础。在此基础上提出频域流匹配(FFM)模型，与IP策略协同工作以保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上的实验表明，IP策略显著提升了多个主流去噪模型在uLDCT任务上的性能。特别地，提出的FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到了最先进的(SOTA)结果。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型广泛使用增加了水印需求，但现有语义水印方案在潜在或频率表征中嵌入信号仍存在脆弱性，即使在资源受限对抗环境下

Method: D2RA通过将水印图像投影到互补表征的自然先验上，抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度，无需训练且仅需单张图像

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示当前设计的基本弱点

Conclusion: D2RA攻击揭示了现有水印方案的根本脆弱性，为更鲁棒的水印设计提供了重要洞见

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个基于扩散模型的视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器和利用成对静态图像数据进行训练，实现内容保持和风格转换的视频风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移中缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战，需要在保持输入视频内容的同时根据文本提示渲染目标风格。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器到自注意力层，利用成对静态图像数据构建合成训练片段，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导(CS-CFG)来分离风格和内容控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了时间连贯、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

TL;DR: 本文提出TRAVL方法改进视频语言模型对物理合理性的判断能力，并创建ImplausiBench基准来评估模型的物理推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。现有视频语言模型在识别物理违规方面表现不佳，暴露了其时序和因果推理的局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型的运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉时序理解。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为多模态模型提供了一个统一的框架，用于探索和改进物理合理性，揭示了视觉时序理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决视频生成模型中的物理合理性评估提供了有效方法，通过改进的视频语言模型和专门的评估基准，推动了多模态模型在物理推理方面的发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类中训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，以及传统单模态模型仅依赖光谱空间数据的局限性。

Method: 使用LLM为每个类别生成文本描述，通过BERT/RoBERTa等文本编码器将描述嵌入向量空间，实现特征-标签对齐的语义光谱空间融合网络。

Result: 在Hyperspectral Wood、HyperspectralBlueberries和DeepHS-Fruit三个基准数据集上取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同作用为语义增强的高光谱图像分类模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

TL;DR: 本文提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露隐私敏感信息，现有的遗忘方法主要针对纯文本模型，而VLM增加了视觉上下文带来的复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的贡献，通过外部模块在低重要性视觉token中编码遗忘信息，而不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明CAGUL方法优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为VLM提供了一种实用有效的遗忘解决方案，无需改变预训练参数或承担重新训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

TL;DR: MaizeStandCounting (MaSC) 是一个基于RGB图像的自动化玉米幼苗计数算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，能够区分玉米与杂草，并通过行列分割提供精确的行级计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工计数玉米株数劳动强度大、速度慢且容易出错，特别是在大面积或变化较大的田地中。需要一种自动化、低成本且准确的解决方案来支持作物管理和研究。

Method: MaSC提供两种处理模式：1）将拼接图像分割成小块处理；2）使用单应性矩阵对齐原始视频帧。两种模式都使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测玉米幼苗，然后基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地人工计数相比，MaSC表现出与地面真实数据的强一致性（拼接图像R²=0.616，原始帧R²=0.906）。处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒，包括推理和后处理，显示出实时操作潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC被证明是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet 在重叠数字检测和仿射变换鲁棒性方面优于传统CNN，但训练和推理速度慢，限制了其在实时应用中的使用。

Conclusion: QCN为开发快速实时CapsNet应用提供了可行起点，在速度和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.

dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种针对整流流模型的改进引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中引起的离流形漂移问题，通过自适应预测器-校正器引导确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器无关引导在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种几何感知的引导方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出自适应预测器-校正器引导，每个推理步骤先执行条件整流流更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间进行插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上的实验表明，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic和T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上始终优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合，确保速度场的边际一致性，并且轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在广泛的引导强度范围内保持稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。研究者希望利用这些模型进行无参考点云质量评估，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本、图像和点云数据来预测质量分数。利用不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图）提供的互补信息。

Result: 在流行基准测试中，该方法以更少的训练迭代次数显著优于现有最先进方法。框架还支持失真定位和识别，为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM模型在无参考点云质量评估方面表现出色，不仅提升了性能，还增强了模型的可解释性和交互能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单流时空建模，但双流方法能学习动作特征来提升分割性能。研究探索第二流动作特征如何通过捕捉动作和动作转换线索来指导分割。

Method: 使用双流架构（帧级流和动作级流），通过时序上下文块（TC块）融合互补信息，采用交叉注意力和量子动作引导调制（Q-ActGM）。提出双流对齐损失，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Conclusion: DSA Net通过双流特征对齐和混合量子-经典框架，显著提升了动作分割性能，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，基于首帧服装替换的视频虚拟试穿策略，通过图像模型替换首帧服装，再利用内容控制生成剩余帧，实现参数和计算效率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的双分支架构难以适配基于Diffusion Transformer的扩散模型，引入服装参考分支特征需要修改主干网络导致参数过多，且服装特征缺乏时间特性需要额外学习。

Method: 使用图像服装转移模型替换首帧服装，在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型的时间先验，顺序合成剩余帧。

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下仍保持领先性能。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧服装替换策略有效解决了现有方法的参数复杂性和时间特征学习问题，实现了高效且性能优越的视频虚拟试穿。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于IP-Adapter的个性化扩散模型改进方法，通过自动生成的掩码在第二次推理中限制图像标记仅作用于主体区域，让文本提示能够更好地控制背景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单复制主体而无法有效响应文本描述。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码，在第二次推理过程中将图像标记限制在主体区域内，使文本提示能够专注于背景和其他图像区域的生成。

Result: 该方法在描述地点和场景的文本提示下，能够生成既准确描绘主体又完全匹配提示的图像，相比其他测试时个性化方法表现出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过掩码限制图像标记作用范围的方法有效解决了个性化扩散模型中主体过度主导的问题，实现了更好的文本-图像对齐效果。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，并通过双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定优化迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上实现优于现有方法的配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中性能优越，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像变形需求下的优化迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 1. 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、学习抑制无关特征、估计最终变形场；2. 提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在配准精度方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数规模。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI的有效集成，成功解决了医学图像配准中的解剖错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Conclusion: 该方法能够为指定元素提供高可控性，同时为未指定元素保持多样性，解决了混合粒度控制的视频合成需求。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在捕捉全局数据分布方面表现优异，但往往忽略了重要的局部相似性信息。为了弥补这一缺陷，需要结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 采用双分支结构：强中心分支和弱配对分支，通过迭代式相互学习实现知识迁移，并引入混合哈希专家模块促进跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，MLH方法持续优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架成功地将局部相似性信息整合到全局哈希学习中，实现了更好的检索性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Conclusion: ComGS框架成功解决了3D物体-场景组合的挑战，实现了高效、高质量的实时渲染效果。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune

TL;DR: 提出UltraLED框架，仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像进行超高动态范围重建，通过曝光校正和亮度感知RAW去噪解决暗区细节恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHDR场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大、传统方法易产生重影和对齐问题，探索仅用单帧短曝光RAW图像实现完整动态范围重建的可能性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过比率图进行曝光校正平衡动态范围，第二阶段使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建9档包围曝光数据集进行训练。

Result: UltraLED在单帧方法中表现显著优于现有方法，能够有效避免重影和运动模糊，在动态场景中具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 证明了仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现UHDR重建的可行性，为动态场景下的高动态范围成像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低帧率RGB视频和高帧率事件流来重建动态3D高斯溅射的新框架，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，解决大帧间运动带来的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯溅射具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊鲁棒，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架提取事件流中的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 采用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3D高斯溅射。

Conclusion: 通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，成功解决了低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯溅射时大帧间运动带来的挑战，实现了两种模态的有效融合。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Method: 使用BraTS2020公开数据集，评估UNet、ResUNet和AttUNet三种深度学习模型，采用Adam优化器训练，使用Grad-CAM和注意力可视化技术分析模型决策过程。

Result: 在最终测试阶段，ResUNet在Dice和Jaccard相似度分数以及准确率、召回率和F1分数方面均优于其他模型，Grad-CAM提供了肿瘤子区域的可视化洞察。

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench)，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别是在大规模摄像头网络中追踪移动目标的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注自我中心视角的图像/视频推理或地理视角的图形推理，缺乏结合图像/视频和图形上下文的地理时空智能评估，这对交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野视频进行联合推理，并对视频未观察到的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估了10多个流行VLM，发现即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro（34.9%）也远低于人类表现（78.61%）。分析揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理中的三个主要缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了宝贵见解和新的机会，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的局限性，特别是在多模态上下文利用、时间预测和地图-视频对齐方面的不足。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Conclusion: 可学习的双相位框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力，能够更全面地捕捉微表情的完整动态过程。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限和过拟合问题，导致准确率低于其他适配方法。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，包含仿射变换（保留原始图像信息）、颜色变换（强调任务相关特征）和加法变换，并使用TrivialAugment数据增强。

Result: 在12个数据集上达到视觉提示方法的SOTA准确率，超越线性探测，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，推理时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过互补变换操作和数据增强有效解决了视觉提示的表达力和过拟合问题，为参数高效微调提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在大型城市场景中面临严重的走样问题和优化不稳定性，特别是在高分辨率渲染时会出现闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，能够显著改善3D高斯的渲染行为，有效缓解走样问题，提升大规模城市场景的渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder是一个基于统一圆柱体提升方法的feedforward模型，通过相机建模和特征提升来解决驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feedforward重建方法在驾驶场景重建中存在两个主要问题：固定视角变换在相机配置改变时失效，限制了跨不同相机配置驾驶场景的泛化能力；稀疏360度全景视图之间的小重叠区域和驾驶场景的复杂性增加了学习难度，降低了重建精度。

Method: 提出统一圆柱体相机建模(UCCM)策略避免学习视角依赖的空间对应关系，用可调参数统一不同相机配置；基于新设计的圆柱平面特征组(CPFG)提出混合表示和专用模块，将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Result: 实验结果表明XYZCylinder在不同评估设置下实现了最先进的性能，并且能够以零样本方式泛化到其他驾驶场景。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度限制问题，在跨相机配置场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

*Peiran Wu,Zhuorui Yu,Yunze Liu,Chi-Hao Wu,Enmin Zhou,Junxiao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARC提出了一种基于记忆增强强化学习的令牌压缩方法，通过检索关键帧和强化学习蒸馏，在视频理解任务中实现95%视觉令牌压缩，同时保持接近基准的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从图像扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有训练无关的令牌压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 采用检索-压缩策略：使用视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段，通过压缩组相对策略优化框架从教师模型向学生模型蒸馏推理能力。

Result: 在六个视频基准测试中，仅使用一帧令牌就达到接近基准准确率，视觉令牌减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。

Conclusion: MARC展示了在资源受限环境下实现高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在制造业质量控制中很重要，但受限于异常样本稀少和标注成本高。异常合成是很有前景的解决方案，但现有研究缺乏对异常合成算法的系统性评估，忽略了关键因素如与检测的分离、合成数据的定量分析和跨场景适应性。

Method: 提出了ASBench基准框架，包含四个评估维度：1）跨数据集和管道的泛化性能；2）合成与真实数据的比例；3）合成图像内在指标与异常检测性能指标的相关性；4）混合异常合成方法的策略。

Result: 通过大量实验，ASBench不仅揭示了当前异常合成方法的局限性，还为异常合成的未来研究方向提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: ASBench填补了异常合成领域系统性评估的空白，为未来异常合成方法的研究和发展提供了重要的基准和指导。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的视频生成框架，通过测试时优化和记忆机制，在推理阶段将视频基础模型的输出与时空布局对齐，以改善文本-图像对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 提出TTOM框架：1）集成和优化新参数，采用通用布局注意力目标；2）在流式设置中制定视频生成；3）使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除操作。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM被证明是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可迁移性和泛化能力，为组合视频生成提供了有效的跨模态对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还要产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息，现有模型难以同时满足这些需求。

Method: 首先微调VAE进行辅助4D重建任务增强3D结构和时间动态编码能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量，同时联合训练高斯泼溅解码器重建动态场景。

Result: 实验显示模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景提供几何信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高质量多视角视频生成与4D场景重建的结合，为全面场景理解提供了有价值的几何信息。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，文本通常具有规则字体、单调颜色和有序布局。而动漫场景中的文本风格多样、排列不规则，且容易与复杂视觉元素混淆，现有数据集无法有效处理这些特点。

Method: 构建了包含73.5万张图像和420万个文本块的大规模数据集，采用分层标注方法，并为动漫场景专门设计了困难负样本。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对灾害管理、农业、交通和能源优化等社会需求至关重要。现有非自回归方法存在局限性，需要改进预测精度。

Method: 提出SimCast训练流程，采用短到长期知识蒸馏技术和加权MSE损失来优先关注强降雨区域；进一步集成到CasCast扩散框架中，结合概率模型优势克服确定性输出的模糊性和分布偏移问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证有效性：SEVIR数据集平均CSI得分0.452，HKO-7数据集0.474，MeteoNet数据集0.361，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCast和CasCast框架能够在不增加推理开销的情况下获得改进的临近预报预测，通过结合确定性预测和概率建模的优势，有效提升了降水临近预报的准确性。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过改进VAE的潜在空间正则化和高频感知重建，在计算效率和细节保留之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢失退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含保真度导向的高频对齐损失编码器LoRA和感知导向的解码器LoRA，采用交替优化和选择性梯度传播。

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE用于UHD修复，实现了计算效率与高频细节保留的良好平衡，提供可调节的保真度-感知权衡。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的适用性，发现在标签预算有限时抽象标签更有效，而在标签数量充足时对象标签同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕获更高层次的信息，有助于需要上下文理解的任务。本文旨在探索哪种标签类型更适合图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的表现，分析不同标签数量下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；当每个图像可获得更多标签时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer模型SwinIR与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能与效率权衡。虽然SwinIR达到更高的PSNR(39.03dB)，但轻量级CNN以37.4dB的竞争性性能，仅需10个训练周期，且模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Motivation: 研究高性能Transformer模型与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能-效率权衡，探索在资源受限的实际应用中更实用的解决方案。

Method: 对比实验设计，将最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN在相同的低光图像恢复任务上进行性能与效率比较。

Result: SwinIR获得更高的峰值性能(PSNR 39.03dB)，但轻量级CNN表现竞争性(PSNR 37.4dB)，且训练效率显著更高(10个周期vs 132个周期)，模型大小小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能够以显著更低的计算开销提供接近最先进水平的性能，在资源受限的实际应用场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是一个端到端的检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过显式的思维链推理来提升组合图像检索的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合图像检索方法（基于VLMs和MLLMs）存在黑盒问题，用户无法理解检索原理，且模型难以遵循复杂的细粒度指令。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，强制模型首先生成可解释的推理链，然后生成专门的检索嵌入。通过三阶段过程创建结构化思维链标注（描述、推理、结论）来训练模型。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上获得高度竞争力表现，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链提高了检索准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: 基于相机的感知系统由于缺乏显式深度信息，在3D目标检测等任务中难以生成准确预测。为了解决深度估计的模糊性问题，需要开发能够有效利用协作信息的融合方法。

Method: 提出RayFusion方法，利用协作车辆的射线占据信息来减少相机射线上的冗余和误报预测，专门针对基于相机的协作感知系统进行优化。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在协作视觉感知任务中持续优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合方法有效解决了相机系统深度估计的模糊性问题，为协作视觉感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一个无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过代码生成实现可解释的高分辨率图像润色，模仿人类多步骤润色过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以适应用户或图像特定的多样化调整需求。

Method: 系统包含视觉评论模块（识别输入与参考图像差异）和代码生成模块（生成可执行代码），以渐进方式增强图像，支持多样化调整路径探索。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整，符合用户意图。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释的白盒图像润色解决方案，通过代码生成实现灵活可控的图像增强。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多时序类别驱动的分层残差神经网络，用于在不同语义级别对多光谱图像时间序列进行分类。该架构通过引入附加分支和层次惩罚映射来提高分类能力，并支持模块化扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多光谱图像时间序列分类中不同语义级别类别的区分问题，以及训练样本有限的情况下引入新类别和任务的挑战，需要一种能够有效利用类别层次结构的分层分类方法。

Method: 修改ResNet架构，引入附加分支进行不同层次级别的分类，使用层次惩罚映射来避免不连贯的层次转换，通过类别层次标签高效训练不同层，前层训练通用类别，后层区分具体类别。

Result: 在亚马逊森林两个区域的12个月Sentinel 2图像合成数据上实验，证明该方法在不同层次级别具有良好的泛化能力，在微类别级别实现准确分类，并能更好地表示少数类别。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过微调可适应新目标区域，分层方法在学习和泛化不同层次类别特征方面表现有效。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Conclusion: RedFace数据集成功填补了学术评估与现实需求之间的差距，为深度伪造检测研究提供了更贴近真实场景的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的物理驱动检测范式能有效识别AI生成视频，通过概率流守恒原理捕捉生成视频中的分布偏移，为AI生成内容检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了首个无数据后门攻击，在保持原始检索精度的同时有效植入后门，且具有强大的防御规避能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Result: 在挑战性头部姿态上显著提升解析精度，同时保持标准视角的强性能，优于现有方法

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需3D标注、可扩展且有效的解决方案，提升现实场景中的人脸解析鲁棒性

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 随机窗位增强技术能显著提高模型在具有挑战性图像上的性能，证明了CT特定增强方法的重要性。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决双向扩散模型固有延迟问题，以及现有自回归视频扩散模型在少步生成中质量下降和运动伪影的挑战。

Method: 首先微调基础I2V模型支持基本运动控制，然后通过基于轨迹的奖励模型进行强化学习改进，采用Self-Rollout机制保持马尔可夫性质，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性加速训练。

Result: AR-Drag在视觉保真度和运动对齐方面表现出色，相比最先进的运动可控VDM显著降低延迟，仅使用13亿参数。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了实时运动可控的视频生成，在保持高质量的同时大幅减少了计算延迟。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象表现为模型无法基于其基础输出来提供逻辑一致的重述问题回答，但其根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解中的瓶颈问题。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR是首个统一的多模态条件视频超分辨率框架，成功解决了多模态条件利用的挑战，为高质量视频生成提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE通过多模态链式思维和深度置信推理，有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的空间关系表示和细节生成问题，为视觉编辑提供了更精确的推理框架。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该自举算法提供了一种有效的几何偏差处理方法，无需依赖对齐训练数据的强假设，在细粒度视觉分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

*Mu Li,Yin Wang,Zhiying Leng,Jiapeng Liu,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual是一个三阶段的双人运动生成方法，通过建模动态层次化交互来生成细粒度的双人运动，在个体、个体间和整体三个层次上分别处理运动特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模人类交互时通常是时间不变的，忽略了距离和层次结构这两个关键属性。人类交互本质上是动态的（运动随距离变化）和层次化的（从个体到个体间再到整体运动）。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 自学习阶段：使用大语言模型将双人整体文本分解为个体文本，在个体层面对齐文本和运动特征；2) 自适应调整阶段：通过交互距离预测器预测交互距离，使用交互感知图网络在个体间层面动态建模人类交互；3) 教师引导精炼阶段：利用整体文本特征作为指导，在整体层面精炼运动特征。

Result: 在双人运动数据集上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，FineDual优于现有方法，能够有效建模动态层次化的人类交互。

Conclusion: FineDual方法通过建模动态层次化交互，能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，解决了现有方法忽略距离和层次结构的问题。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGC框架解决遥感图像单正多标签学习中的监督模糊问题，通过梯度校准和自适应触发机制实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签分类能提供更全面的遥感图像语义理解，但完整标注成本高昂。单正多标签学习虽然可扩展，但存在严重的监督模糊问题，在遥感领域研究有限

Method: AdaGC框架包含梯度校准机制、Mixup数据增强和双EMA模块，通过自适应触发机制在训练动态基础上启动梯度校准

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集和两种不同标签噪声类型下，AdaGC实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持强鲁棒性

Conclusion: AdaGC是专门为遥感图像设计的通用SPML框架，能有效缓解标签噪声过拟合，在单正多标签学习任务中表现优异

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTN-Diff模型，通过频率感知的扩散模型解决文本引导图像修复中的语义一致性和未掩码区域保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法同时解决未掩码区域保护和掩码/未掩码区域语义一致性这两个长期挑战，这源于不同频率波段在去噪过程中对文本提示的鲁棒性差异。

Method: 将去噪过程分为早期（高频噪声）和晚期（低频噪声）阶段，在去噪过程中解耦中低频波段。使用稳定的中频波段作为指导，通过空文本去噪过程处理掩码区域的低频波段。

Result: 大量实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性，能够同时实现跨区域的语义一致性和未掩码区域的保护。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率感知的扩散模型成功解决了文本引导图像修复中的两个关键挑战，在保持未掩码区域的同时实现了掩码与未掩码区域的语义一致性。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义消解问题，提升指称理解的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在处理包含强烈曝光变化的真实场景数据时（如室内外混合场景、有窗户的房间），输出质量会显著下降。

Method: 学习一个预测每个3D点最优曝光值的神经场，通过新型神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: NExF能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，显著提升了真实场景3D重建的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力堆叠和全局查询设计，在视频指代分割任务中实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在局部性和全局性之间平衡不佳的问题，以及计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加的问题。

Method: 设计LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）每个查询随机选择全局池中的一组键进行注意力；3）设计全局查询与其他所有查询交互以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个视频指代分割基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能够有效提取长程时序上下文信息，显著提升视频指代分割性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Motivation: 现有方法使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽略了3D数据的内在挑战（稀疏性、噪声、几何模糊性），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 1. 提出跨模态亲和力转移（CMAT）预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；2. 设计跨模态功能分割Transformer（CAST），集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征，生成精确的提示感知分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架为3D功能分割建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，有效解决了3D功能分割中的语义边界不清晰问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的数据无关后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来降低视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但完全替换二次方注意力需要昂贵的预训练，且线性注意力的表达能力有限。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择建模为二元分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍延迟降低，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型计算成本高的问题，通过智能层选择和高效的分布匹配目标，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在安全关键应用中。由于交通场景中的关键物体通常位于远处，需要系统具备良好的远距离感知能力。

Method: 创建DTPQA基准，仅包含感知类问题（排除推理问题），并添加距离标注。评估多个最先进的小型视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类约85%的表现。模型在区分左右等特定感知任务上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前的小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知任务上表现不足，特别是在远距离感知和方向辨别方面，需要进一步改进才能满足自动驾驶应用的需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一建模扩展到视频领域，展示了强大的多任务能力和泛化性能，为未来视频生成研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various

Conclusion: 提出的LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了无源域自适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的模型适应性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse是一个新的文本到视频生成基准测试，专注于评估模型对现实世界复杂时间因果性和世界知识的理解能力，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法区分最先进的文本到视频模型，缺乏对事件级时间因果性和世界知识的系统性评估，而这些对于构建世界模型至关重要。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取具有时间因果性的事件描述，重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个维度的二元评估问题，开发基于视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐评估流程。

Result: VideoVerse包含300个精心策划的提示，涉及815个事件和793个评估问题，对开源和闭源T2V模型进行了系统性评估。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间差距的深入分析，为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

### [176] [Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08431)
*Kaiwen Zheng,Yuji Wang,Qianli Ma,Huayu Chen,Jintao Zhang,Yogesh Balaji,Jianfei Chen,Ming-Yu Liu,Jun Zhu,Qinsheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了score-regularized连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过结合score蒸馏作为长跳跃正则化器，在保持高生成多样性的同时提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临Jacobian-vector product计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP内核，支持超过100亿参数模型训练；提出rCM模型，将score蒸馏作为长跳跃正则化器整合到sCM中，结合前向散度的"模式覆盖"特性和反向散度的"模式寻求"特性。

Result: 在高达140亿参数的大规模模型和5秒视频任务上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本，加速扩散采样15-50倍。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的中心凹注意力机制，利用回报差异指导视觉强化学习中的注意力聚焦，显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习代理需要从高维图像数据中学习，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中心凹注意力机制，通过回报差异指导注意力聚焦。使用基于回报差异的对比学习，将相似视觉表征按回报差异分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组训练注意力机制。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提升最高达2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的注意力机制能够有效识别任务相关特征，显著提升视觉强化学习的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础量化到高级特征提取的多种图像处理任务，为实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用提供可靠工具。

Method: 采用模块化方法：灰度图像八级量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间的直方图均衡化、HSV值通道亮度调整、3×3卷积核图像锐化、集成反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大的双向变换管道，以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测和形态学窗口定位等几何特征提取技术。

Result: 双向变换管道正向和反向过程准确率分别达到76.10%和74.80%；Hough线估计成功检测到51.50°的台球杆对齐角度；球杆隔离与真实图像的相似度达到81.87%；在多样化数据集上表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理任务中表现出色，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力，其确定性和稳健性使其适用于各种实际应用场景。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖文本先验，在开放词汇场景下难以区分语义相似的动作，存在跨模态幻觉问题。

Method: 将动作分解为判别性子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交错，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构一致性。

Result: 在HMDB-51、UCF-101、SSv2、Kinetics-400和Kinetics-600数据集上取得最先进性能，在区分细粒度动作和处理跨模态幻觉方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-STAR通过子动作分解和工具增强强化学习，实现了从文本中心推理到视觉基础推理的转变，展现出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了视觉象似性挑战基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在理解手语象似性方面的能力，发现当前模型在音系形式预测、透明度和象似性评分方面仍远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要评估视觉语言模型从动态人体动作而非静态上下文中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法，评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：音系手语形式预测、透明度和分级象似性评分。

Result: 模型在音系形式预测方面能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关。有趣的是，音系形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 研究验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并表明需要采用以人为本的信号和具身学习方法，以建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Conclusion: InstructX证明了通过精心设计的MLLM与扩散模型集成，可以在单一框架中有效统一图像和视频编辑，同时缓解视频训练数据稀缺的问题。

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要人工选择专用模型或采用单一架构难以泛化到不同退化类型。

Method: 提出三智能体协作系统：1）基于视觉语言模型的退化识别器；2）大语言模型驱动的自适应路由器；3）专门为修复任务设计的VLM视频质量评估模型。构建了大规模视频退化识别基准和修复视频质量数据集。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的潜力，为处理复杂现实世界视频退化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇，但很少研究ViT视觉编码器中的高范数视觉标记。这些ViT注意力汇包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中往往被忽视。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT汇标记中的信息，并开发了无需训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。通过显式利用这些标记来增强视觉推理。

Result: 通过利用ViT注意力汇标记，在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进，证明了这些标记在增强视觉推理方面的未开发潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇包含关键的语义信息，通过适当利用这些标记可以显著提升大型视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，这是当前架构中未被充分利用的重要资源。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: 本文连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论依据的替代方案，证明了利用预训练模型内在冗余性的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

TL;DR: 提出SpatialLadder方法，通过渐进式训练框架建立空间智能，在空间推理任务上实现SOTA性能，显著超越GPT-4o和Gemini-2.0-Flash。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在局限性，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础。需要建立渐进式的空间智能构建方法。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，采用三阶段渐进训练框架：1) 通过目标定位建立空间感知；2) 通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；3) 通过强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准测试中平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，在域外基准上保持7.2%的改进。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要，SpatialLadder方法证明了这种层次化方法的有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: Kontinuous Kontext是一个指令驱动的图像编辑模型，通过引入标量编辑强度参数，实现从无变化到完全编辑的连续精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑方法仅依赖文本指令，缺乏对编辑程度的精细控制。需要一种能够连续调节编辑强度的解决方案。

Method: 扩展现有图像编辑模型，增加标量编辑强度输入，通过轻量级投影网络将标量和编辑指令映射到模型的调制空间系数。使用生成模型合成图像-编辑-指令-强度四元组数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型能够统一处理从细微到强烈的各种编辑操作（风格化、属性、材质、背景、形状变化），无需特定属性训练即可实现连续编辑强度控制。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext提供了指令驱动编辑中编辑强度的连续控制维度，实现了从无变化到完全编辑的平滑过渡，增强了用户对编辑过程的精细控制能力。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MM-HELIX基准测试和AHPO训练策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的长链反思推理能力，在基准测试上获得+18.6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现出色，但其长链反思推理能力（解决复杂现实问题的前提）尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建MM-HELIX基准测试，开发Step-Elicited Response Generation管道创建MM-HELIX-100K数据集，并提出自适应混合策略优化（AHPO）训练策略，动态统一离线监督和在线优化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基线上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准测试上获得+18.6%准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能提升+5.7%。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以有效学习和泛化，为开发更强大的MLLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，重点关注美国和中国文化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和接地能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：教师模型使用理论驱动的提示生成候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示：1)模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2)对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3)提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4)在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化接地视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为此提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的高效性和SLAM管道的可靠性，通过3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，使用高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现了交互式性能、鲁棒性和接近逐场景优化的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建中的关键权衡问题：逐场景优化方法精度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型可实现实时推理但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能、与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，同时实现了准确的几何结构和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来导航状态作为查询，选择性检索相关环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持久性视觉语言导航任务中实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖整个记忆合并或固定范围查找；主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器集成检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准测试中，Memoir在所有场景均显著改进：IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线SPL提升5.4%，训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式仍有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: VideoCanvas是一个新颖的视频生成框架，通过零参数修改实现了任意时空视频补全，解决了因果VAE引入的时间模糊性问题，在冻结骨干网络上实现了像素级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成任务（如图像到视频、修复、扩展、插值）缺乏统一的灵活范式，且现代潜在视频扩散模型存在时间模糊性问题，难以实现精确的帧级控制。

Method: 采用上下文条件化（ICC）范式，提出混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续分数位置，无需新增参数。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件化范式，在场景内保真度和场景间创造力方面都建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了因果VAE的时间模糊性问题，实现了灵活统一的视频生成，为任意时空视频补全任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成大而复杂的运动，缺乏对中间帧细节的精细控制，难以满足用户多样化的创作意图。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)架构，将运动控制映射为基于点的统一表示，分离内容和运动控制为两个分支，采用分阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 该框架在灵活性、易用性和精度之间取得了平衡，为视频编辑和长视频合成提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据时空不平衡的根本挑战，导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测而损害即时安全性。

Method: ResAD框架采用归一化残差轨迹建模，预测相对于确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用点归一化重新加权优化目标。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS分数。

Conclusion: ResAD方法显著简化了学习任务并提高了模型性能，证明了通过残差建模和归一化处理可以有效地解决轨迹预测中的优化不平衡问题。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Method: 系统研究端到端原生MLLM训练的各种选择，获得最佳元架构平衡性能与训练成本，探索视觉编码器与LLMs的扩展关系。

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL表现出与现有MLLMs竞争的性能，验证了视觉编码器与LLMs的正相关扩展关系。

Conclusion: 提出的NaViL模型和简单高效的训练方法为未来原生MLLMs研究提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视角下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，提升了重建质量和稳定性

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量多模态轨迹稀缺和手动标注成本高的问题，提升VLM作为控制器的工具使用能力。

Method: 构建M-TRACE数据集（28.5K多模态任务，177K验证轨迹），开发MATRIX Agent控制器，引入Pref-X偏好对进行逐步偏好学习。

Result: 在Agent-X、GTA和GAIA三个基准测试中，MATRIX均超越开源和闭源VLM，展示了可扩展且有效的多模态工具使用能力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

### [200] [ReSplat: Learning Recurrent Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08575)
*Haofei Xu,Daniel Barath,Andreas Geiger,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯溅射模型，通过迭代优化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号，在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型依赖单次前向推理，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化且适应未见数据分布的方法。

Method: 提出循环高斯溅射模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，大幅减少高斯数量。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256到540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法在显著减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环优化机制和高效初始化策略，成功解决了前馈高斯溅射模型的性能限制问题，实现了更好的泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核的流水线，构建了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，在KernelBench基准测试中显著优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GPU内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题，因为大多数高质量内核是专有且不开源的，这阻碍了使用监督微调来使LLMs适应内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核的流水线，构建ConCuR数据集，并训练KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，模型显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，所提出的观察、指标以及数据收集和筛选流水线有助于未来在内核生成任务中获得更好的数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在训练阶段让模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，增强基础模型的推理能力，无需改变架构、参数数量或训练数据，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提升LLM推理能力的方法要么扩大模型规模和数据，要么通过复杂思维链增加推理计算。研究发现推理所需的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此提出更高效的方法。

Method: Encode-Think-Decode (ETD)方法：在中期训练阶段训练基础模型在推理相关层子集上迭代，保持原始架构不变；推理时在选定层上迭代；还探索了自适应深度策略。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升：OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究缺乏统一标准，评估方法过于依赖选择题准确率，无法真实反映模型生成行为，需要更全面的评估框架来指导未来研究。

Method: 提出了三种方法家族的分类法：差异驱动优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的目标遗忘；引入开放问答评估指标来替代传统选择题评估；对WMDP基准进行重新评估分析。

Result: 发现当前评估方法高估了遗忘成功率，忽视了实际生成行为；揭示了遗忘效果与效用保持之间的权衡关系；证明了鲁棒性需要更细粒度的分析。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了全面的重新审视和可操作的指导，强调了需要更全面的评估框架来准确衡量遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiveThinking是一个两阶段优化框架，通过知识蒸馏和强化学习压缩推理路径，在保持大模型推理能力的同时实现亚秒级延迟，显著提升电商直播中数字人助手的响应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商直播中的数字人需要实时响应来提升用户参与度，但高延迟的大推理模型(LRMs)无法满足这一需求，需要在保持推理能力的同时大幅降低延迟。

Method: 第一阶段：通过拒绝采样微调(RFT)将670B教师模型蒸馏为30B MoE模型(3B激活)，降低计算成本但保留详细推理；第二阶段：使用群组相对策略优化(GRPO)压缩推理路径，通过多目标奖励函数平衡正确性、帮助性和简洁性。

Result: 计算成本降低30倍，实现亚秒级延迟；在淘宝直播实际应用中，响应正确性提升3.3%，帮助性提升21.8%；经数十万观众测试，显著提升商品交易总额(GMV)。

Conclusion: LiveThinking框架有效解决了电商直播场景中实时响应需求，在保持推理质量的同时大幅降低延迟，显著改善了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

*Md. Saiful Bari Siddiqui,Md Mohaiminul Islam,Md. Golam Rabiul Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DUA-D2C方法，在D2C基础上通过动态不确定性感知的聚合机制改进子模型权重分配，有效缓解深度学习中的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准D2C方法对所有子模型采用平等或固定启发式聚合，未能充分利用各子模型泛化能力的差异信息。

Method: 在D2C分区训练基础上，引入基于共享验证集性能的动态权重聚合机制，综合考虑准确率和预测不确定性。

Result: 在多个领域基准数据集上的实验表明，DUA-D2C显著提升泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法之上应用仍能进一步改善性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一种理论上有依据且有效的深度学习方法，能够更有效地对抗过拟合问题。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症显著影响个体的沟通、学习、行为和社交能力，早期干预和定制教育策略至关重要，但目前缺乏对技能发展前细微行为模式和情绪识别的理解。

Method: 采用纵向方法监测情绪和行为，分析行为趋势，为自闭症学生（特别是信息技术领域）建立基线理解，提出针对性技术辅助框架。

Result: 建立了自闭症儿童行为模式和情绪识别的基线理解，提出了基于证据的干预方法，强调以深度理解每个孩子的行为和情绪景观为基础。

Conclusion: 通过将重点转向早期行为模式识别，可以营造更包容和支持的学习环境，显著改善自闭症儿童的教育和发展轨迹。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

TL;DR: MultiFair是一种用于多模态医学分类的新方法，通过双层级梯度调制过程解决模态学习不平衡和群体不公平问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习模型存在两个关键挑战：1）不同数据模态学习不均衡，导致模型偏向某些模态；2）模型可能偏向某些人口群体，造成不公平性能。这两个方面相互影响，导致不平衡且不公平的多模态学习。

Method: 提出MultiFair方法，采用双层级梯度调制过程，在数据模态和群体层级上动态调节训练梯度的优化方向和幅度。

Result: 在两个包含不同人口群体的多模态医学数据集上进行广泛实验，结果显示MultiFair优于最先进的多模态学习和公平性学习方法。

Conclusion: MultiFair通过双层级梯度调制有效解决了多模态医学分类中的模态不平衡和群体不公平问题，在性能和公平性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

TL;DR: MetaDefense是一个防御LLM微调越狱攻击的新框架，采用两阶段防御方法：预生成检测和中生成监控，显著优于现有防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLM在嵌入空间能够区分这些查询。

Method: 两阶段防御：预生成阶段检测有害查询，中生成阶段监控部分响应；通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对可见和未见攻击模板的有害查询都能实现稳健防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense提供了一种有效的防御框架，能够早期终止潜在有害交互，同时保持模型在正常任务上的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个利用多模态大语言模型进行时间序列分析的新框架，通过将时间序列数据转换为视觉表示来弥补数值数据与自然语言之间的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类分析师视觉检查时间序列模式的启发，研究者希望探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化时间序列分析。多模态大语言模型具有强大的泛化和视觉理解能力，但应用于时间序列时面临数值数据与自然语言之间的模态差距挑战。

Method: 提出MLLM4TS框架，将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图组成复合图像，捕捉跨通道的空间依赖性，并采用时间感知视觉块对齐策略将视觉块与对应时间段对齐。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型相结合以实现稳健和可泛化的时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

*Emre Can Acikgoz,Cheng Qian,Heng Ji,Dilek Hakkani-Tür,Gokhan Tur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时自改进方法，通过识别模型不确定的样本、生成相似示例并进行测试时微调，显著提升模型性能且大幅减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型微调依赖大规模训练数据，但数据收集效率低、训练成本高，且无法保证模型在复杂场景下的泛化能力。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 提出三步骤算法：1) 识别模型难以处理的样本（自我意识）；2) 从不确定样本生成相似示例（自数据增强）；3) 在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。研究两种变体：TT-SI（同模型自生成）和TT-D（强模型生成供学生模型学习）。

Result: 在多个智能体基准测试中，TT-SI平均带来+5.48%的绝对准确率提升，性能优于其他标准学习方法，同时使用的训练样本减少68倍。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的方法使用简化的离散形式表示药物结构，无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，药物-药物相互作用风险仍是临床决策支持系统的重要挑战

Method: MMM框架整合3D量子化学信息，使用ELF生成3D电子密度图，结合ELF衍生特征（编码全局电子特性）和二分图编码器（建模局部子结构相互作用），学习药物分子的互补特征

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上与基线模型比较，特别是与GNN-based SafeDrug模型相比，F1分数(p=0.0387)、Jaccard指数(p=0.0112)和DDI率(p=0.0386)均显示统计显著改进

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出D-SINK框架，通过协同利用专门处理类别不平衡和标签噪声的'弱'辅助模型，增强深度学习模型对长尾噪声数据的双重鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集常同时面临类别不平衡和标签噪声问题，现有方法难以有效结合，因为区分真实尾部样本和噪声数据很困难，导致优化策略冲突。作者发现类别不平衡（分布层面）和标签噪声（样本层面）在不同粒度上运作，其鲁棒性机制可以互补而不冲突。

Method: 提出Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK)框架，通过最优传输优化的代理标签分配，将目标模型的样本级预测与噪声鲁棒辅助模型对齐，类别分布与不平衡鲁棒辅助模型对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，D-SINK显著提高了鲁棒性，在长尾噪声数据学习中取得了强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: D-SINK通过协同利用专门化辅助模型的互补优势，有效解决了类别不平衡和标签噪声的共现挑战，为处理现实世界复杂数据集提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究测试了多种深度学习超分辨率模型，用于提高牙齿孔隙网络的显微成像效率，通过生物学驱动的评估方法发现传统图像质量评估指标与视觉感知不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙齿机械感觉系统依赖牙本质孔隙网络中的流体流动，但现有共聚焦显微镜的高分辨率成像视野有限，需要开发更高效的成像方法。

Method: 使用四种深度学习超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN、CycleGAN），在实验配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像上进行训练和测试，像素尺寸增加2、4、8倍。

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，但基于孔隙网络结构和连通性的生物学驱动评估能更好解释模型性能差异。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构的超分辨率评估需要采用生物学驱动的分析方法，而非依赖通用图像质量指标，这能更准确地反映模型在保留关键结构特征方面的表现。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于LLM的智能体中的对手塑造问题，提出了ShapeLLM方法，证明LLM智能体能够在竞争性和合作性游戏中成功影响对手的学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增加，多智能体交互不可避免，需要理解这类系统中的战略行为。核心问题是LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互来塑造学习动态并影响其他智能体的行为。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体量身定制的模型无关对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: 在多种博弈论环境中，LLM智能体能够成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡（在竞争性游戏中），并促进协调和提高集体福利（在合作性游戏中）。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过交互相互塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

*Yihong Luo,Tianyang Hu,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO算法，一种新的在线强化学习算法，直接利用组级偏好信息，无需依赖策略梯度框架，解决了扩散模型中GRPO方法需要随机策略与高效确定性ODE采样器之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GRPO等强化学习方法显著提升了大型语言模型，但将其应用于扩散模型仍具挑战性。GRPO需要随机策略，而最高效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE。现有方法使用低效的SDE采样器引入随机性，但依赖模型无关的高斯噪声导致收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO)，一种新的在线RL算法，完全摒弃策略梯度框架。DGPO直接从组级偏好学习，利用组内样本的相对信息。这种设计消除了对低效随机策略的需求，支持使用高效的确定性ODE采样器和更快的训练。

Result: 广泛实验表明，DGPO比现有最先进方法训练速度快约20倍，在域内和域外奖励指标上均实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DGPO成功解决了扩散模型中强化学习应用的关键冲突，通过直接组级偏好优化实现了显著的速度提升和性能改进。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mix-和MoE-DPO框架，通过软混合模型和专家混合架构扩展DPO，解决了传统DPO在多样化偏好分布下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，在多任务设置中表达能力有限，难以适应异构或多样化的偏好分布。

Method: 引入基于潜在变量的专家分配模型，通过变分证据下界优化，使用软混合模型和MoE架构学习专业化专家策略。

Result: 在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证，证明该方法在偏好对齐方面具有强大且可扩展的能力。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了一个强大且可扩展的方法，支持参数效率和专业化之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种基于果蝇嗅觉电路启发的LoRA变体，通过隐式MoE设计消除显式路由器，在保持计算效率的同时解决参数干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，MoE-based LoRA变体虽然能缓解单任务内的相关性，但在多任务模型合并中仍然存在任务间干扰，且需要额外路由器参数。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在up-projection矩阵中引入rank-wise专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和down-projection，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统可训练密集版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，FlyLoRA相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅取得了实证收益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，其随机矩阵的正交性特性天然缓解了任务间干扰。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

TL;DR: UML是一种模态无关的训练范式，通过交替处理不同模态的输入并共享参数，利用无配对的多模态数据增强单模态表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习依赖配对数据集，但能否利用无配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表示学习是一个被忽视但具有潜力的问题。

Method: 提出UML框架：单一模型交替处理不同模态输入，跨模态共享参数，利用不同模态是共享底层现实的投影这一假设，无需显式配对即可受益于跨模态结构。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，无配对辅助数据能产生比单模态训练更具信息量的表示；实证表明使用文本、音频或图像等无配对辅助数据能持续提升图像和音频等单模态目标的下游性能。

Conclusion: UML证明了无配对多模态数据可以有效增强单模态表示学习，为利用丰富但未配对的跨模态数据提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，通过强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间实现最优平衡，无需手动设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：高端模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态升级规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱，也无法跨任务类型自适应。

Method: 使用强化学习端到端训练路由器，采用明确的成本感知奖励函数编码成本-性能权衡。路由器可以直接回答或调用外部模型，无需手动设计路由规则。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（如在可比较的任务完成率下显著降低成本），并提供了关于学习路由可靠性的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，其开放实现将促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Motivation: 传统AI模型由于数据不平衡和有限标注，在检测困难肺结节（低尺寸、亮度、对比度）方面面临挑战。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN与FPN骨干网络，在混合数据集（NODE21、VinDr-CXR、CheXpert和11,206张DDPM生成的合成图像）上进行训练，基于尺寸、亮度和对比度的难度分数指导课程学习。

Result: 课程学习模型平均AUC为0.95，基线为0.89（p < 0.001），敏感性（70% vs 48%）和准确率（82% vs 70%）均有提升，在所有难度级别均表现一致改善。

Conclusion: 课程引导的合成增强提高了肺结节检测模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with
diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult
pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size,
brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to
data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid
Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising
expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/-
11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images.
Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum
learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean
average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC).
Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and
paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89
for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs.
48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis
demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard).
Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under
curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic
augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule
detection.

Conclusion: SatFusion通过统一的多时相和多源数据融合框架，有效解决了卫星物联网图像增强中的关键问题，为实际应用提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of
satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the
continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images
across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully
exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source
dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances
reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple
observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images
constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source
images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data,
but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes
noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration.
To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for
Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion.
Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF)
module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a
Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture
information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module
adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while
dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination
of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB,
and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion
quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to
real-world Sat-IoT scenarios. The code is available at:

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

TL;DR: VersionRAG是一个版本感知的RAG框架，通过分层图结构建模文档演化，在版本敏感问题上达到90%准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理版本化技术文档时失败，因为缺乏时间有效性检查，在版本敏感问题上准确率只有58-64%。

Method: 使用分层图结构捕获版本序列、内容边界和文档状态间的变化，通过意图分类进行专门的检索路径路由，实现精确的版本感知过滤和变更追踪。

Result: 在VersionQA基准测试中达到90%准确率，比朴素RAG(58%)和GraphRAG(64%)显著提升；在隐式变更检测上达到60%准确率，而基线方法几乎失败(0-10%)；索引时比GraphRAG减少97%的token使用。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了版本化文档问答作为一个独立任务，并为未来研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ReasonEmbed, a novel text embedding model
developed for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our work includes three
key technical contributions. First, we propose ReMixer, a new data synthesis
method that overcomes the triviality problem prevalent in previous synthetic
datasets, enabling large-scale production of 82K high-quality training samples.
Second, we design Redapter, a self-adaptive learning algorithm that dynamically
adjusts training each sample's weight based on its reasoning intensity. This
allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple
backbones of varying sizes, all of which achieve superior performance on
reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含200个人类与共享自动驾驶车辆交互的数据集，包含文本对话和调查数据，通过案例研究展示了数据集的实用性，包括识别SAV接受度的关键预测因子和比较情感分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享自动驾驶车辆将成为交通系统的重要组成部分，需要研究有效的人机交互。目前缺乏相关数据集来支持这一领域的研究。

Method: 收集了200个人类与SAV的交互数据，包括2,136次对话交换和调查结果。使用随机森林模型和弦图识别关键预测因子，并比较了LLM与传统TextBlob方法的情感分析性能。

Result: 发现响应情感极性是SAV接受度和服务质量感知的关键影响因素。零样本LLM提示在情感分析方面比传统方法更接近用户报告的情感，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计对话式SAV界面提供了新见解，并为进一步研究高级情感建模、自适应用户交互和多模态对话系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are likely to become an important part of
the transportation system, making effective human-SAV interactions an important
area of research. This paper introduces a dataset of 200 human-SAV interactions
to further this area of study. We present an open-source human-SAV
conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV
exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range
of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two
benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams,
we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality,
highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e.,
perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based
sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.
Results indicate that even simple zero-shot LLM prompts more closely align with
user-reported sentiment, though limitations remain. This study provides novel
insights for designing conversational SAV interfaces and establishes a
foundation for further exploration into advanced sentiment modeling, adaptive
user interactions, and multimodal conversational systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IntentionVLA是一个新的视觉-语言-动作模型框架，通过课程训练范式赋予模型意图推理能力，在复杂人机交互任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的VLA模型在预训练阶段缺乏与具身场景相关的推理密集型任务训练，无法处理复杂现实交互中所需的隐式人类意图推理。

Method: 提出课程训练范式：首先使用精心设计的推理数据进行训练（包含意图推理、空间定位和紧凑具身推理），然后在微调阶段将紧凑推理输出作为动作生成的上下文指导。

Result: 在直接指令下比π0模型成功率提高18%，在意图指令下比ECoT提高28%。在分布外意图任务中，成功率是基线方法的两倍以上，零样本人机交互成功率40%。

Conclusion: IntentionVLA为下一代人机交互系统提供了一个有前景的范式，能够有效处理隐式意图推理和复杂现实交互。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising
path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs
are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied
scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions.
Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and
reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit
human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To
overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework
with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our
proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine
intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning,
endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the
following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs
as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under
indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA
substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with
direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On
out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the
success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot
interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a
promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Motivation: 开发能够在动态人群环境中安全、高效且符合社会规范的自主导航系统，解决仅使用车载传感器（RGB-D和里程计）且无全局地图信息情况下的社会导航挑战。

Method: 在Falcon模型基础上引入主动风险感知模块，通过学习预测周围人类的基于距离的碰撞风险评分，增强代理的空间意识和主动避障能力。

Result: 在Social-HM3D基准测试中，该方法提高了代理在拥挤室内场景中保持个人空间合规性的能力，在16个参赛团队中获得第二名。

Conclusion: 主动风险感知模块有效提升了社会导航性能，证明了基于风险预测的方法在动态人群环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the
IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on
developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous
agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic
human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate
from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D
observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged
information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances
and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a
Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our
approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to
predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which
enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive
collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark
demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal
space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with
dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the
challenge.

Result: 在TACO基准测试中实现最先进的物体姿态估计性能（ADD-S和VSD分别提升0.08和0.12），在OakInk-v2上成功率比先前方法提高19%。

Conclusion: DexMan能够从真实和合成视频生成技能，无需手动数据收集，为训练通用灵巧操作创建大规模多样化数据集。

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%

Conclusion: R2RGen框架为机器人操作提供了高效的数据增强解决方案，能够直接从真实数据生成多样化的训练样本，提升策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization
is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly
under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself.
To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover
different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy
via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that
leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from
minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant
sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as
fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly
augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data.
R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and
plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce
an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A
group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object
compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware
processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D
sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive
experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on
mobile manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据高效的动力学建模和自主数据收集，有效解决了sim-to-real挑战，在真实世界评估和遥操作应用中验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge
in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from
simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous
manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained
scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,
constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real
challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in
simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the
real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns
to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world
collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The
model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand
interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing
system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each
joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net
effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that
gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.
Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy
successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),
high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse
wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and
a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central
goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on
fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.
We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task
description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any
demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a
video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using
off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative
poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals
and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a
tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics
model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow
naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and
deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot
quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without
demonstrations or embodiment-specific training. Project website:

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶等机器人系统的离线评估无法准确预测在线性能，微小错误可能在测试时累积导致事故，这种关系在复杂城市场景中研究不足。

Method: 通过大量仿真实验分析离线与在线评估的相关性，并研究基于认知不确定性的离线指标来捕捉可能导致闭环错误的场景。

Conclusion: 当前驾驶策略评估实践和指标的有效性值得怀疑，基于认知不确定性的离线指标能更好地弥合离线与在线评估的差距。

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic
systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted
offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected
validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from
offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these
settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time
infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly
across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work,
we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive
set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in
simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online
settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of
current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge
the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric
based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to
cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13%
improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further
validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment
in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet
creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing
tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise,
are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based
compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing
simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes,
handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous
model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable
simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for
probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our
model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators
for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency.
FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis,
offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种优化神经场的方法，可在单次前向传播中进行预滤波，通过傅里叶特征嵌入的解析缩放实现卷积滤波，支持多种参数化滤波器，训练快速且无需额外网络约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场擅长表示连续视觉信号，但通常只能在单一固定分辨率下工作，需要一种能够进行预滤波的优化方法。

Method: 在输入域进行卷积滤波，通过分析缩放傅里叶特征嵌入与滤波器频率响应；使用单样本蒙特卡洛估计训练神经场；支持高斯、Box和Lanczos等参数化滤波器。

Result: 在神经场滤波方面相比现有方法取得了定量和定性的改进，训练和推理速度都很快。

Conclusion: 该方法简单而强大，能够高效优化神经场进行预滤波，支持多种滤波器且不增加网络架构约束。

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可拼接的神经基元表示方法，结合了神经辐射场的高表达能力和3D高斯泼溅的实时渲染效率，使用更少的基元和参数实现同等质量的新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，神经辐射场表达能力强但渲染成本高，而基元方法渲染快但表达能力有限。需要一种能兼顾表达能力和渲染效率的新表示方法。

Method: 使用有界神经密度场作为基元，每个基元由浅层神经网络参数化。通过解析求解线积分，实现高效准确的泼溅核计算，无需光线步进。

Result: 在新视角合成基准测试中，与3D高斯泼溅相比，使用10倍更少的基元和6倍更少的参数，实现了同等的质量和速度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将神经模型的表达能力与基元泼溅的效率相结合，提供了一种紧凑且高效的3D场景表示方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: X2Video是首个基于内在通道（反照率、法线、粗糙度、金属度、辐照度）引导的扩散模型，可生成逼真视频，支持参考图像和文本提示的多模态控制，并确保时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对内在属性的精确控制，无法准确操作颜色、材质、几何和光照。X2Video旨在通过内在通道引导和多模态控制解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频生成；2. 使用混合自注意力确保时间一致性；3. 开发掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示；4. 采用递归采样方法生成长视频；5. 构建InteriorVideo数据集支持训练。

Result: X2Video能够生成长时间、时间一致且逼真的视频，有效支持多模态控制，包括参考图像、全局和局部文本提示，并能通过参数调整编辑颜色、材质、几何和光照。

Conclusion: X2Video是首个内在通道引导的视频扩散模型，通过创新的注意力机制和采样方法，实现了高质量、可控的视频生成，为视频编辑和创作提供了强大工具。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

### [241] [PATCH: Mitigating PII Leakage in Language Models with Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07452)
*Anthony Hughes,Vasisht Duddu,N. Asokan,Nikolaos Aletras,Ning Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出PATCH方法，通过识别和编辑语言模型中的PII泄露电路来减少隐私信息泄露，相比现有防御方法在隐私-效用权衡方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型可能从训练数据中记忆个人身份信息(PII)，攻击者可在推理过程中提取这些信息。现有防御机制如差分隐私会大幅降低模型效用。

Method: 使用电路发现技术识别导致PII泄露的计算电路，然后直接编辑这些PII电路来减少泄露。

Result: PATCH将PII泄露召回率降低高达65%，与差分隐私结合可将残留泄露召回率降至0.01%。

Conclusion: PII泄露电路在现有防御机制后仍然存在，而PATCH能有效减轻其影响，提供更好的隐私保护效果。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) may memorize personally identifiable information (PII)
from training data, enabling adversaries to extract it during inference.
Existing defense mechanisms such as differential privacy (DP) reduce this
leakage, but incur large drops in utility. Based on a comprehensive study using
circuit discovery to identify the computational circuits responsible PII
leakage in LMs, we hypothesize that specific PII leakage circuits in LMs should
be responsible for this behavior. Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware
Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and
subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves
better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall
of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to
reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%. Our analysis
shows that PII leakage circuits persist even after the application of existing
defense mechanisms. In contrast, PATCH can effectively mitigate their impact.

TL;DR: 使用AI技术分析2024年总统选举前YouTube用户评论，发现移民和民主是最常被讨论的议题，身份政治次之，而通胀议题被提及频率显著较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索哪种数据科学方法能更准确地识别影响选民决策的关键议题，特别是比较AI驱动的意见挖掘与传统民调的差异。

Method: 采用两种基于自然语言处理和聚类分析的方法，分析选举前一周来自《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》YouTube频道的8000多条用户评论，量化各议题的出现频率。

Result: 移民和民主议题在用户评论中出现频率最高且最一致，身份政治次之，而通胀议题被提及频率显著较低，这与某些选后调查结果一致但反驳了通胀重要性的假设。

Conclusion: 基于原始用户数据的意见挖掘方法在分析选举结果方面比传统民调和调查更具揭示性。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore two competing data science methodologies to
attempt answering the question, "Which issues contributed most to voters'
choice in the 2024 presidential election?" The methodologies involve novel
empirical evidence driven by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By using
two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering
analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube
videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left
leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the
frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues
were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November
5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and
democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user
comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity
politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These
results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute
the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that
variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can
be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循机器，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力的发展。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据；潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子；自我表征是视觉静默的。通过实证分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上不同于符号流和训练语料库。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层发射机制，其中包含认知内容。证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性质。

Conclusion: C1自我意识工作空间是构建安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM在零样本设置下测试其理解BPMN流程模型图像、回答查询以及执行深度推理的能力，并进行实证分析。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，在语法、逻辑和语义层面提供智能回答。不同LLM性能存在差异，但都显示出作为流程设计助手的潜力。LLM表现出类人化的推理特性。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，具备理解流程模型、发现错误和深度推理的能力，展现出类人化的思维特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决流行路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两个阶段来识别和创建热门路线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在流行路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调整和重新训练，而大型语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将LLMs应用于地理空间问题具有重要价值。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，分为两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别历史轨迹数据中的流行路径，GENERATE阶段在没有现有路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将LLMs的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为流行路径查询提供了一种无需训练和参数调整的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: 研究发现现有评估指标系统性低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，提出了组匹配分数和改进的测试时匹配算法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但现有评估指标可能低估了模型的实际能力，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来利用组结构，提出测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4，GPT-4.1在Winoground上首次超越估计的人类表现，TTM在16个数据集上实现一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，可以显著提升AI模型的组合推理能力，揭示了模型隐藏的潜力。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个可复现的模拟框架来评估多模态环境中生成代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，且容易过度信任误导性图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在多模态环境下对安全性、连贯性和信任的推理能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用可复现的模拟框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划和多模态感知的代理，并采用SocialMetrics行为指标套件来量化计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 代理在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅55%，三个模型的平均不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%，45%的不安全行动在误导性视觉下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在严重局限性，需要改进代理的全局安全对齐能力，该框架为研究多模态安全、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚它们是否真正具备化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 引入oMeBench（首个大规模专家策划的有机机理推理基准）和oMeS（结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性的动态评估框架），分析最先进LLM的性能。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。通过提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供严格基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注转录或问答等孤立能力，缺乏对多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估，无法满足真实语音代理场景的需求。

Method: 通过包含印度语境的对话，涵盖单工具调用、多工具工作流、多轮交互和安全评估；使用基于说话人嵌入的新型采样算法进行TTS语音转换，最大化声学和说话人多样性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距，暴露了关键局限性。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench填补了语音代理评估的空白，为开发更强大的语音语言模型提供了重要基准，揭示了现有模型在真实世界应用中的不足。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征来评估在线评论质量，在大型电商平台上通过A/B测试验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖手工特征，难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化；深度学习模型缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual模拟人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，自主实现工具操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。

Result: 在亿级用户平台的大规模A/B测试中，平均每位用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算特征，虽然以评论质量评估为例，但设计为通用框架。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了语言模型在风险规避方面的可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要。需要防止AI系统无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究考察语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定对齐，但存在显著差异，表明需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量方法。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和提升大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过查询组合构建多步推理任务，发现现有模型在长视野推理中存在显著性能下降，并利用该方法构建数据通过强化学习显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来测试大型推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激LRMs的长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步推理任务的长视野推理基准，并利用该基准数据通过带验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)训练模型。

Result: 评估发现最先进的LRMs在长视野推理任务中性能显著下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。RLVR与R-HORIZON训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提升7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用Pass@k指标评估模型推理边界，但发现在大采样预算下基础模型反而优于RLVR模型，这可能是由于离散答案空间中的随机猜测效应导致的误导。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例完成结果正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，该指标能有效捕捉在明确可靠性阈值下的推理能力。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估多个RLVR模型发现，相比Pass@1，模型相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地反映模型的真实推理能力，避免随机猜测的干扰，为评估语言模型推理边界提供了更好的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级解码器架构，使用动态门控机制自适应融合语言和视觉信息，在BabyLM挑战赛约束下实现高效多模态学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息，特别是在BabyLM挑战赛2025的视觉赛道约束条件下。

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比目标进行视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上表现出与多模态基线相当或更优的性能。动态门控机制发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督即可为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能，尽管挑战赛约束存在信息瓶颈和训练不稳定性等局限性。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的代码生成代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索(MCGS)来解决机器学习工程中的AutoML和Kaggle竞赛任务，在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在机器学习工程任务中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，现有MLE方法使用线性或树状搜索限制了知识传递，无法利用完整历史轨迹或跨分支共享信息，限制了自进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索(MCGS)实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习，配合细粒度操作符集提高稳定性和加速收敛。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过领域知识集成和图搜索策略，有效解决了LLM在机器学习工程任务中的局限性，显著提升了AutoML和竞赛任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在连续微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在学习新技能时保持原有能力。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时监控八个基准测试的通用能力，识别输出令牌分布的偏移，并提出两种简单的调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up层。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可以部分恢复，通过提出的调优方法可以在获得强目标增益的同时保持基准性能。

Conclusion: 选择性更新特定层是减少大型多模态模型遗忘问题的有效策略，为连续学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决多轮交互任务中模型需要战略性地收集信息并知道何时停止收集、做出决策的问题，避免过度思考或偏离方向

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调，训练LLM解释终止决策的推理过程，将这种能力注入基础LLM

Result: 在医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs在信息收集过程中适时终止，提升任务性能

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据进行监督微调，但专家数据范围有限且难以扩展。强化学习在缺乏可验证奖励或需要长序列的环境中训练困难。

Method: 提出两种使用早期经验的策略：隐式世界建模（利用收集的状态来理解环境动态）和自我反思（从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策）。

Result: 在八个不同环境中的评估显示，该方法持续提高了效果和跨领域泛化能力。在具有可验证奖励的环境中，为后续强化学习提供了良好基础。

Conclusion: 早期经验作为模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，具有重要价值。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

TL;DR: 提出一种参数空间校正方法，通过比较在源域上分别使用真实标签和伪标签微调的两个ASR模型的权重差异，构建校正向量来修正伪标签中的系统性偏差，从而在无目标域真实标签的情况下提升跨域ASR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实ASR系统面临领域偏移问题，特别是遇到未见口音时，伪标签方法虽然实用但会引入系统性口音特定错误，而传统过滤方法无法修正这些偏差。

Method: 在源域中，从相同初始化分别使用真实标签和伪标签微调两个ASR模型，计算它们的权重差异作为校正向量，然后将该向量应用于伪标签目标模型。

Result: 在AfriSpeech-200数据集上，对10种非洲口音使用Whisper tiny模型，实现了高达35%的相对词错误率降低。

Conclusion: 提出的参数空间校正方法能有效修正伪标签中的系统性偏差，显著提升跨域ASR性能，且无需目标域真实标签。

Abstract: Robust ASR under domain shift is crucial because real-world systems encounter
unseen accents and domains with limited labeled data. Although pseudo-labeling
offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific
errors that filtering fails to fix. We ask: How can we correct these recurring
biases without target ground truth? We propose a simple parameter-space
correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data,
two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth
labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a
correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a
pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to
a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten
African accents with the Whisper tiny model.
