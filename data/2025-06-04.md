### [2] [No Free Lunch in Active Learning: LLM Embedding Quality Dictates Query Strategy Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01992)
*Lukas Rauch,Moritz Wirth,Denis Huseljic,Marek Herde,Bernhard Sick,Matthias Aßenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）嵌入改进深度主动学习（AL）的可行性，通过冻结LLM嵌入降低计算成本，并分析了嵌入质量对查询策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用LLM的通用表示能力，减少深度AL中迭代微调的计算开销，并探索嵌入质量对AL策略选择的影响。

Method: 使用MTEB排行榜上的五个高性能模型和两个基线模型，在十个文本分类任务中评估不同查询策略的效果。

Result: 发现多样性采样与高质量嵌入协同提升早期AL性能；查询策略选择对嵌入质量敏感，Badge策略更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AL策略的效果高度依赖嵌入质量和目标任务，需进行上下文特定评估。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing
general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active
learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the
computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study
establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM
embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing
models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two
baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key
insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling
synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL
iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to
embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can
achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like
Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness
is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results
emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as
performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

### [3] [NovelHopQA: Diagnosing Multi-Hop Reasoning Failures in Long Narrative Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02000)
*Abhay Gupta,Michael Lu,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NovelHopQA是一个新基准，用于评估大语言模型在长上下文和多跳推理任务中的表现，发现即使前沿模型在增加跳数和上下文长度时准确性也会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长上下文和多跳推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏同时测试这两方面的基准。

Method: 通过从83部小说中提取64k-128k标记的片段，构建基于关键词的多跳问答链，并评估6个前沿模型。

Result: 模型在跳数和上下文长度增加时准确性下降，表明规模并不保证推理能力。

Conclusion: NovelHopQA为大规模多跳推理提供了诊断工具，揭示了模型的常见失败模式。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span
tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved.
While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop
reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in
natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to
evaluate k1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length
public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains
grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate six state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely
answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We noticed
consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length, even in
frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning.
Our failure mode analysis highlights common breakdowns, such as missed
final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled
diagnostic setting to stress-test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

### [4] [Pruning for Performance: Efficient Idiom and Metaphor Classification in Low-Resource Konkani Using mBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02005)
*Timothy Do,Pranav Saran,Harshita Poojary,Pranav Prabhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合mBERT、双向LSTM和线性分类器的混合模型，用于低资源语言（如Konkani）中的比喻语言处理，并通过注意力头剪枝策略提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言处理系统在低资源语言中处理比喻语言表达时的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的mBERT结合双向LSTM和线性分类器，并采用梯度注意力头剪枝策略优化模型。

Result: 在比喻分类任务中准确率达78%，在习语分类任务中达83%。

Conclusion: 注意力头剪枝策略能有效提升低资源语言NLP工具的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the persistent challenges that figurative language
expressions pose for natural language processing (NLP) systems, particularly in
low-resource languages such as Konkani. We present a hybrid model that
integrates a pre-trained Multilingual BERT (mBERT) with a bidirectional LSTM
and a linear classifier. This architecture is fine-tuned on a newly introduced
annotated dataset for metaphor classification, developed as part of this work.
To improve the model's efficiency, we implement a gradient-based attention head
pruning strategy. For metaphor classification, the pruned model achieves an
accuracy of 78%. We also applied our pruning approach to expand on an existing
idiom classification task, achieving 83% accuracy. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of attention head pruning for building efficient NLP tools in
underrepresented languages.

### [5] [Enhancing Paraphrase Type Generation: The Impact of DPO and RLHF Evaluated with Human-Ranked Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02018)
*Christopher Lee Lübbers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合人类偏好数据和直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，提高了改写类型的生成准确性和人类偏好评分，并创建了一个新的人类标注数据集以支持未来评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改写类型生成方法因依赖自动化指标和有限的人类标注数据，常与人类偏好不一致，导致语义保真度和语言转换的关键方面被忽视。

Method: 研究利用人类排名的改写类型数据集，并整合直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，以直接对齐模型输出与人类判断。

Result: DPO训练将改写类型生成准确性提高了3个百分点，人类偏好评分提高了7个百分点。改写类型检测模型在多种任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 偏好数据和DPO训练能生成更可靠、语义准确的改写，为下游应用（如摘要和改进的问答）提供支持，并推动基于人类标准的改写类型研究。

Abstract: Paraphrasing re-expresses meaning to enhance applications like text
simplification, machine translation, and question-answering. Specific
paraphrase types facilitate accurate semantic analysis and robust language
models. However, existing paraphrase-type generation methods often misalign
with human preferences due to reliance on automated metrics and limited
human-annotated training data, obscuring crucial aspects of semantic fidelity
and linguistic transformations.
  This study addresses this gap by leveraging a human-ranked paraphrase-type
dataset and integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align model
outputs directly with human judgments. DPO-based training increases
paraphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points over a supervised
baseline and raises human preference ratings by 7 percentage points. A newly
created human-annotated dataset supports more rigorous future evaluations.
Additionally, a paraphrase-type detection model achieves F1 scores of 0.91 for
addition/deletion, 0.78 for same polarity substitution, and 0.70 for
punctuation changes.
  These findings demonstrate that preference data and DPO training produce more
reliable, semantically accurate paraphrases, enabling downstream applications
such as improved summarization and more robust question-answering. The PTD
model surpasses automated metrics and provides a more reliable framework for
evaluating paraphrase quality, advancing paraphrase-type research toward
richer, user-aligned language generation and establishing a stronger foundation
for future evaluations grounded in human-centric criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD在科学和工程中至关重要，但操作复杂且需要专业知识，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 结合CFD和OpenFOAM知识，构建结构化数据库，通过语言模型实现配置验证和错误反馈。

Result: 验证显示ChatCFD能自主复现复杂CFD结果，超越基础示例，适应未见配置。

Conclusion: ChatCFD成功整合语言模型与CFD知识，显著提升自动化模拟的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for scientific and
engineering advancements but is limited by operational complexity and the need
for extensive expertise. This paper presents ChatCFD, a large language
model-driven pipeline that automates CFD workflows within the OpenFOAM
framework. It enables users to configure and execute complex simulations from
natural language prompts or published literature with minimal expertise. The
innovation is its structured approach to database construction, configuration
validation, and error reflection, integrating CFD and OpenFOAM knowledge with
general language models to improve accuracy and adaptability. Validation shows
ChatCFD can autonomously reproduce published CFD results, handling complex,
unseen configurations beyond basic examples, a task challenging for general
language models.

### [7] [FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037)
*Feng Wang,Yiding Sun,Jiaxin Mao,Wei Xue,Danqing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinS-Pilot是一个针对在线金融应用的RAG系统评估基准，结合实时API数据和结构化文本，填补了金融领域专用评估工具的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融RAG基准因数据保密性和动态数据整合不足而受限，需开发专用评估工具。

Method: 基于真实金融助手交互数据，结合实时API和结构化文本，通过意图分类框架组织数据。

Result: FinS-Pilot能有效评估金融助手处理静态知识和实时市场信息的能力，并筛选适合金融应用的LLMs。

Conclusion: FinS-Pilot为金融NLP系统研究提供了实用评估框架和数据集，填补了领域空白。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated
through standardized benchmarks. However, the development of financial RAG
benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of
dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduces FinS-Pilot, a
novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications.
Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark
incorporates both real-time API data and structured text sources, organized
through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains
such as equity analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. The benchmark enables
comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both
static knowledge and time-sensitive market information. Through systematic
experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's
effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while
addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial
domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a
curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and
dataset are accessible on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PhealenWang/financial\_rag\_benchmark}.

### [8] [Enhancing Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with BranchLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02041)
*Duzhen Zhang,Yong Ren,Zhong-Zhi Li,Yahan Yu,Jiahua Dong,Chenxing Li,Zhilong Ji,Jinfeng Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出BranchLoRA框架，通过不对称设计和灵活调优机制解决多模态持续指令调优中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MoE LoRA的方法在多模态持续指令调优中因参数效率低和简单聚合导致灾难性遗忘，性能随时间下降。

Method: 提出BranchLoRA框架，采用不对称设计、调优-冻结机制和任务特定路由器，优化分支分配并引入任务选择器简化推理。

Result: 实验表明BranchLoRA在多模态持续指令调优基准上显著优于MoELoRA，且适用于不同规模的MLLM。

Conclusion: BranchLoRA通过高效参数利用和任务协作机制，有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升多模态持续指令调优性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However,
these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all
LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In
this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA
framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose
BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance.
To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within
BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while
fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate
task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time,
rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we
introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the
appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on
the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms
MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

### [9] [Evaluating the Unseen Capabilities: How Many Theorems Do LLMs Know?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02058)
*Xiang Li,Jiayi Xin,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出KnowSum框架，通过量化未观察到的知识来更全面地评估大语言模型（LLMs），揭示现有评估方法忽略了大量知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型的评估方法未能全面反映其实际能力，尤其是忽略了未观察到的知识。

Method: 引入KnowSum统计框架，通过外推观察到的知识实例频率来估计未观察部分。

Result: 实验表明，KnowSum能显著改进LLMs的知识评估，并改变常见模型的排名。

Conclusion: KnowSum为LLMs评估提供了更全面的视角，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
understanding their capabilities and guiding their development. However,
current evaluations often inconsistently reflect the actual capacities of these
models. In this paper, we demonstrate that one of many contributing factors to
this \textit{evaluation crisis} is the oversight of unseen knowledge --
information encoded by LLMs but not directly observed or not yet observed
during evaluations. We introduce KnowSum, a statistical framework designed to
provide a more comprehensive assessment by quantifying the unseen knowledge for
a class of evaluation tasks. KnowSum estimates the unobserved portion by
extrapolating from the appearance frequencies of observed knowledge instances.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of KnowSum across three critical
applications: estimating total knowledge, evaluating information retrieval
effectiveness, and measuring output diversity. Our experiments reveal that a
substantial volume of knowledge is omitted when relying solely on observed LLM
performance. Importantly, KnowSum yields significantly different comparative
rankings for several common LLMs based on their internal knowledge.

### [10] [Knowledge or Reasoning? A Close Look at How LLMs Think Across Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02126)
*Juncheng Wu,Sheng Liu,Haoqin Tu,Hang Yu,Xiaoke Huang,James Zou,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了推理增强型大语言模型在医学和数学领域的逐步推理能力，提出了一种细粒度评估框架，发现监督微调和强化学习对推理质量的影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理增强型大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但其内部推理过程的质量和透明度尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过将推理轨迹分解为知识和推理两部分，引入知识指数（KI）和信息增益（InfoGain）评估框架，研究了监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）对模型的影响。

Result: 发现R1蒸馏模型在医学领域的推理能力未有效迁移；SFT提高最终答案准确率但降低推理质量；RL通过修剪不准确知识提升医学推理。

Conclusion: 监督微调在医学领域仍不可或缺，而强化学习能有效优化推理路径，提升知识正确性和推理准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced Large Language Models such as
OpenAI-o1/3 and DeepSeek-R1 have significantly improved performance on complex
tasks. However, the quality and transparency of their internal reasoning
processes remain underexplored. This work moves beyond the final-answer
accuracy and investigates step-by-step reasoning in the medical and
mathematical domains by explicitly decomposing the thinking trajectories into
two parts: knowledge and reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained
evaluation framework that judges: (1) the correctness of knowledge used
(measured by Knowledge Index (KI)) and (2) the quality of reasoning (measured
by Information Gain (InfoGain)). Using this framework, we study R1-distilled
and base Qwen models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and/or
reinforcement learning (RL) in the medical and math domains. Three intriguing
findings emerge: (1) The general reasoning abilities in R1-distilled models do
not transfer effectively to the medical domain through either SFT or RL. (2)
SFT raises final-answer accuracy in both domains, but often at the cost of
reasoning quality: InfoGain drops by 38.9% on average compared with untrained
models; In the medical domain, however, SFT remains crucial because domain
knowledge is indispensable. (3) RL enhances medical reasoning by pruning
inaccurate or irrelevant knowledge from reasoning paths, thereby improving both
reasoning accuracy and knowledge correctness.

### [11] [Model Internal Sleuthing: Finding Lexical Identity and Inflectional Morphology in Modern Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02132)
*Michael Li,Nishant Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现代大型语言模型（如BERT、GPT-2、Pythia等）如何编码词汇和形态信息，发现词汇信息在早期层线性集中，后期层非线性集中，而形态信息在各层均线性可分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代大型语言模型如何编码语言信息，尤其是词汇和形态特征。

Method: 训练线性和非线性分类器，分析模型各层的激活状态，预测词汇词根和形态特征。

Result: 词汇信息依赖记忆，形态信息通过抽象编码；所有测试模型均表现出相似模式。

Conclusion: 尽管模型架构和规模不同，语言信息的组织方式具有一致性，可能是预训练中学习到的核心特性。

Abstract: Large transformer-based language models dominate modern NLP, yet our
understanding of how they encode linguistic information is rooted in studies of
early models like BERT and GPT-2. To better understand today's language models,
we investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and
contemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train
linear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word
lemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical
information linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later
layers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and
linearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these
models encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but
rely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably,
these patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in
architecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and
instruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite
substantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize
linguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could
be fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during
pretraining. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ml5885/model_internal_sleuthing.

### [12] [BabyLM's First Constructions: Causal interventions provide a signal of learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02147)
*Joshua Rozner,Leonie Weissweiler,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使训练数据量符合儿童语言学习的实际情况，语言模型仍能学习并表现多样化的构式，且构式表现与模型性能相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在符合儿童语言学习数据量的情况下是否仍能学习构式，并验证构式学习对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用Rozner等人的方法，评估2024 BabyLM挑战赛中模型的构式学习能力。

Result: 模型能学习多样化的构式，包括表面难以区分的案例；构式表现与模型性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: 构式学习在开发合理的语言模型中仍然有效，且可能对模型性能有功能上的贡献。

Abstract: Construction grammar posits that children acquire constructions (form-meaning
pairings) from the statistics of their environment. Recent work supports this
hypothesis by showing sensitivity to constructions in pretrained language
models (PLMs), including one recent study (Rozner et al., 2025) demonstrating
that constructions shape the PLM's output distribution. However, models under
study have generally been trained on developmentally implausible amounts of
data, casting doubt on their relevance to human language learning. Here we use
Rozner et al.'s methods to evaluate constructional learning in models from the
2024 BabyLM challenge. Our results show that even when trained on
developmentally plausible quantities of data, models represent diverse
constructions, even hard cases that are superficially indistinguishable. We
further find correlational evidence that constructional performance may be
functionally relevant: models that better represent constructions perform
better on the BabyLM benchmarks.

*Amir Hussein,Cihan Xiao,Matthew Wiesner,Dan Povey,Leibny Paola Garcia,Sanjeev Khudanpur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HENT-SRT提出了一种分层高效的神经转录器框架，通过任务分解和自蒸馏技术解决语音翻译中的词序问题和性能下降，同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经转录器在语音翻译中面临词序处理和性能下降的挑战，且训练成本高。

Method: 采用分层编码器、无状态预测器和剪枝转录器损失，结合自蒸馏和CTC一致性正则化，优化解码过程。

Result: 在阿拉伯语、西班牙语和普通话数据集上取得最佳性能，显著缩小与AED模型的差距。

Conclusion: HENT-SRT有效解决了语音翻译中的关键问题，同时提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming,
demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR).
However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging,
as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance
degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with
attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches
also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we
propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech
Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and
translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while
preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency
regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating
best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical
encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training
complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing
deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three
conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new
state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the
gap with AED-based systems.

*Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Luisa Bentivogli,Andre Martins,Giuseppe Attanasio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语音翻译模型中隐藏状态是否捕捉性别信息，并分析了其对翻译中性别分配的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音翻译模型是否像语音模型一样能捕捉性别特征，以及这对翻译中性别分配的影响。

Method: 使用探测方法评估不同语音翻译模型中的性别编码能力，涵盖三种语言方向（英-法/意/西）。

Result: 传统编码器-解码器模型能捕捉性别信息，而新架构（通过适配器整合语音编码器和翻译系统）则不能。性别编码能力低会导致翻译偏向男性默认值。

Conclusion: 新架构的语音翻译模型在性别编码上表现较差，可能导致翻译中的性别偏见问题更显著。

Abstract: Recent studies on interpreting the hidden states of speech models have shown
their ability to capture speaker-specific features, including gender. Does this
finding also hold for speech translation (ST) models? If so, what are the
implications for the speaker's gender assignment in translation? We address
these questions from an interpretability perspective, using probing methods to
assess gender encoding across diverse ST models. Results on three language
directions (English-French/Italian/Spanish) indicate that while traditional
encoder-decoder models capture gender information, newer architectures --
integrating a speech encoder with a machine translation system via adapters --
do not. We also demonstrate that low gender encoding capabilities result in
systems' tendency toward a masculine default, a translation bias that is more
pronounced in newer architectures.

TL;DR: AI辩论能帮助减少偏见，提高判断准确性，尤其在争议性话题如COVID-19中。研究发现，AI辩论比单一顾问系统更有效，且AI法官表现优于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI影响力增大，其可能放大错误信息并加深社会分歧。研究旨在探索AI辩论是否能通过对抗性讨论帮助人类克服偏见，接近真相。

Method: 通过两项研究：一是人类法官（主流或怀疑派）评估AI辩论或顾问系统的表现；二是模拟人类偏见的AI法官评估相同问题。

Result: AI辩论显著提高判断准确性（主流派+15.2%，怀疑派+4.7%），AI法官表现优于人类（78.5% vs 70.1%）。

Conclusion: AI辩论是一种有前景的偏见弹性监督方法，结合人类与AI判断，有助于在争议领域接近真相。

Abstract: As AI grows more powerful, it will increasingly shape how we understand the
world. But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and
deepening social divides-especially on consequential topics like public health
where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to
ensure AI truthfulness by enabling humans to supervise systems that may exceed
human capabilities--yet humans themselves hold different beliefs and biases
that impair their judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges
toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of
controversial COVID-19 factuality claims where people hold strong prior
beliefs. We conduct two studies: one with human judges holding either
mainstream or skeptical beliefs evaluating factuality claims through
AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols, and a second examining the same
problem with personalized AI judges designed to mimic these different human
belief systems. In our human study, we find that debate-where two AI advisor
systems present opposing evidence-based arguments-consistently improves
judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy with a
single-advisor system by 10% overall. The improvement is most significant for
judges with mainstream beliefs (+15.2% accuracy), though debate also helps
skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views
(+4.7% accuracy). In our AI judge study, we find that AI judges with human-like
personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5%) than human judges (70.1%) and
default AI judges without personas (69.8%), suggesting their potential for
supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a
promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight--leveraging both
diverse human and AI judgments to move closer to truth in contested domains.

*Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Mauro Cettolo,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过特征归因技术分析现代Conformer-based ASR系统依赖的声学线索，发现其对元音、摩擦音和爆破音的特定声学特性有不同偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ASR技术取得显著进展，但模型依赖的具体声学线索仍不明确，且先前研究仅限于少数音素和过时模型。

Method: 应用特征归因技术分析现代Conformer-based ASR系统，评估其对元音、摩擦音和爆破音的声学特性依赖。

Result: ASR模型更依赖元音的完整时间跨度（尤其是前两个共振峰，男性语音更显著），对摩擦音中的咝音频谱特性捕捉更佳，且优先关注爆破音的释放阶段（特别是爆破特性）。

Conclusion: 研究提升了ASR模型的可解释性，并指出了未来研究可能揭示的模型鲁棒性潜在缺陷。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely
on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of
phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution
technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based
ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how
feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and
frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings
show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their
first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better
captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants
and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst
characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and
highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model
robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BehaviorBox的自动化方法，用于比较语言模型在细粒度文本特征上的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型评估困难，现有方法如提示词脆弱、语料库困惑度模糊，且基准选择繁多，需要一种自动化方法找到模型间的具体差异。

Method: 使用性能感知的上下文嵌入（performance-aware contextual embeddings）提取细粒度特征，展示两个模型在生成难度上的差异。

Result: BehaviorBox能够识别具体上下文特征（如特定短语或标点使用），揭示模型间的性能差异，这些差异无法通过语料库困惑度等传统方法发现。

Conclusion: BehaviorBox为语言模型比较提供了自动化、细粒度的分析工具，揭示了传统评估方法无法捕捉的性能差异。

Abstract: Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle,
corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless.
Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two
LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can
this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for
automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual
embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms
another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that
demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs.
Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in
fine-grained contexts, such as "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'"
and "exclamation marks after emotional statements", where one model outperforms
another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models
that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into
specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which
cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义重要性的语音情感识别方法，通过预训练语言模型筛选关键语音片段，提升识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算整句或长段语音的特征可能遗漏细微变化，需改进以捕捉更相关的声学变化。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型提取语义重要片段，仅计算这些片段的声学特征（如能量和F0），结合自监督表示。

Result: 基于语义重要性的片段选择显著提高了情感识别的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚焦关键语音片段，有效提升了情感识别的准确性。

Abstract: In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying
speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for
discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for
features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions,
potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form
statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived
from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments.
Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments,
enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard
acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised
representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition
performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word
informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决领域特定任务对话系统的高成本和技术难度问题，促进跨学科合作。

Method: 提出CoDial框架，将专家知识转化为结构化异构图，并集成到现有对话逻辑语言中。

Result: 在STAR数据集上达到SOTA性能，在MultiWOZ数据集上与基线模型竞争，支持迭代优化。

Conclusion: CoDial是一个实用工具，支持专家指导的高风险领域LLM对齐。

Abstract: It is often challenging to teach specialized, unseen tasks to dialogue
systems due to the high cost of expert knowledge, training data, and high
technical difficulty. To support domain-specific applications - such as law,
medicine, or finance - it is essential to build frameworks that enable
non-technical experts to define, test, and refine system behaviour with minimal
effort. Achieving this requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between
developers and domain specialists. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework, CoDial (Code for Dialogue), that converts expert knowledge,
represented as a novel structured heterogeneous graph, into executable
conversation logic. CoDial can be easily implemented in existing guardrailing
languages, such as Colang, to enable interpretable, modifiable, and true
zero-shot specification of task-oriented dialogue systems. Empirically, CoDial
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the STAR dataset for inference-based
models and is competitive with similar baselines on the well-known MultiWOZ
dataset. We also demonstrate CoDial's iterative improvement via manual and
LLM-aided feedback, making it a practical tool for expert-guided alignment of
LLMs in high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: ImpRAG是一种无需显式查询的检索增强生成系统，通过统一检索和生成过程，提升模型在多样化任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统将检索和生成分离，限制了模型在多样化任务中的表现，因此需要一种更统一的解决方案。

Method: 将预训练的解码器语言模型分为专用层组，通过两阶段推理过程同时优化检索和生成任务。

Result: 在8个知识密集型任务中，ImpRAG在未见任务上的精确匹配分数提升了3.6-11.5。

Conclusion: ImpRAG通过平衡检索和生成参数，利用生成困惑度作为检索训练目标，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems traditionally treat retrieval
and generation as separate processes, requiring explicit textual queries to
connect them. This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize
across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named
ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG
allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the
need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language
models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation
tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using
the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation,
thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models.
Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves
3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse
formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their
own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the
importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging
generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced
performance.

Motivation: 探索赛后采访中的韵律特征是否能反映比赛结果，并利用自监督学习模型提高分类准确性。

Method: 结合传统声学特征（如音高和强度）与自监督学习模型（Wav2Vec 2.0和HuBERT），使用机器学习分类器区分胜负。

Result: 自监督学习表示能有效区分胜负，韵律特征（如音高变化）仍是胜利的强指标。

Conclusion: 赛后采访的韵律特征和自监督学习模型可用于比赛结果分类，揭示了情感状态与语音模式的关联。

Abstract: This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and
losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores
the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview
recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL)
representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity,
alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine
whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features
and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine
learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing
players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate
between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to
emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability
-- remain strong indicators of victory.

Conclusion: LAM SIMULATOR高效且有效，减少人工输入，加速AI代理开发。

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face
challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for
multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding
to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive
framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality
feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive
collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model
(LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables
LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery
of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action
trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for
LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena,
highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with
self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance
gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR
requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM
SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“语法提示”的方法，通过让大语言模型（LLM）先解释语法规则，再将解释作为额外上下文输入目标模型，显著提升了模型在判断句子可接受性时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）能够解释语法规则，但在实际应用中却难以正确判断句子可接受性。研究旨在解决这一理论与实践的差距。

Method: 采用“解释-处理”范式（grammar prompting），即先由LLM生成语法现象的简明解释，再将解释作为上下文输入目标模型（LLM或小型语言模型SLM），用于判断句子对中的语法正确性。

Result: 在多个语言基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，缩小了LLM与SLM之间的准确率差距，尤其在结合思维链（chain-of-thought）时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 语法提示是一种轻量级、语言无关的方法，能够帮助低成本SLM在多语言环境中接近前沿LLM的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often
fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present
"grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first
produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that
explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an
LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a
minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian
RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements
over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's
metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between
knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average
LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by
56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight,
language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in
multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量作者归属错误公平性的指标MAUIk，并发现现有模型存在不公平性，尤其是对某些作者的误归风险更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者归属错误在现实中可能带来严重后果，而现有评估方法未考虑公平性，因此需要量化这种不公平性。

Method: 引入Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk)指标，评估五个模型在两个数据集上的不公平性。

Result: 所有模型均表现出高度不公平性，某些作者的误归风险更高，且与模型在潜在空间中的嵌入方式相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了误归风险的潜在危害，建议在模型构建和使用中与终端用户沟通并校准风险。

Abstract: Authorship misattribution can have profound consequences in real life. In
forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an
evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny.
This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal
risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution
systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a
simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how
often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this
measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets.
All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some
authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models
embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we
observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors closer to the
centroid (or center) of the embedded authors in the haystack. These results
indicate the potential for harm and the need for communicating with and
calibrating end users on misattribution risk when building and providing such
models for downstream use.

Motivation: 在线内容中的毒性问题对心理和社会有负面影响，需要更全面的数据集和改进的检测方法。

Method: 合并现有数据集，标注毒性、目标社会群体和毒性片段，并评估大型语言模型的性能。

Result: 微调模型表现优于零样本和少样本提示，但对某些社会群体表现仍不佳；推理能力未显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在社会推理能力上较弱，需进一步改进毒性检测方法。

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models,
has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological
and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset
designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has
labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a
diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability,
and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated
data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity
detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that
fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting,
though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning
capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs
have weak social reasoning skills.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRM）依赖现有模型（如R1）限制了领域发展，研究旨在探索独立开发LRM的可能性。

Method: 提出Long CoT Collection数据集，利用短链思维LLM标注100K长链思维推理，开发管道引入新推理策略并控制思维预算。

Result: 数据集质量接近R1，实验显示训练后模型推理能力提升，强化学习效果显著增强（2-3倍增益）。

Conclusion: Long CoT Collection为独立开发LRM提供了可行路径，同时解决了过度思考问题，推动了领域发展。

Abstract: With the release of R1, a publicly available large reasoning model (LRM),
researchers commonly train new LRMs by training language models on R1's long
chain-of-thought (CoT) inferences. While prior works show that LRMs'
capabilities can be reproduced through direct distillation, the continued
reliance on the existing models (e.g., R1) remains a critical limitation in
advancing the field. As a first step toward independent LRM development, this
paper explores the possibility of constructing a long CoT dataset with LLMs
that are not trained for inference-time scaling. To this end, we present the
Long CoT Collection, a dataset of 100K CoT rationales annotated using existing
short CoT LLMs. We develop a pipeline that induces o1's novel reasoning
strategies into short CoT LLMs, enabling them to think longer and introducing
controllability over the thought budget to better manage the overthinking
problem. Our extensive analyses validate that our dataset achieves quality
comparable to--or slightly below--R1. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate
that training on our dataset not only strengthens general reasoning skills, but
also provides a strong foundation for reinforcement learning--models
initialized on our data achieve 2-3x larger gains with RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动故事生成方法在叙事连贯性和逻辑一致性上表现不足，影响了故事体验，因此需要改进。

Method: 采用基于SVO三元组的节点结构，结合动态模块STORYLINE和NEKG，持续优化故事生成过程。

Result: 实验显示Storyteller在人类偏好评估中平均胜率达84.33%，并在创意、连贯性、吸引力和相关性等方面领先。

Conclusion: Storyteller通过系统性方法显著提升了自动故事生成的质量，为AI创作提供了新方向。

Abstract: Stories are central to human culture, serving to share ideas, preserve
traditions, and foster connections. Automatic story generation, a key
advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), offers new possibilities for
creating personalized content, exploring creative ideas, and enhancing
interactive experiences. However, existing methods struggle to maintain
narrative coherence and logical consistency. This disconnect compromises the
overall storytelling experience, underscoring the need for substantial
improvements. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce Storyteller,
a novel approach that systemically improves the coherence and consistency of
automatically generated stories. Storyteller introduces a plot node structure
based on linguistically grounded subject verb object (SVO) triplets, which
capture essential story events and ensure a consistent logical flow. Unlike
previous methods, Storyteller integrates two dynamic modules, the STORYLINE and
narrative entity knowledge graph (NEKG),that continuously interact with the
story generation process. This integration produces structurally sound,
cohesive and immersive narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Storyteller significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 84.33%
average win rate through human preference evaluation. At the same time, it is
also far ahead in other aspects including creativity, coherence, engagement,
and relevance.

TL;DR: 论文提出TruthOverTricks评估范式，揭示现有虚假信息检测器依赖表面线索的问题，并提出SMF框架增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息检测模型常依赖训练数据中的表面线索（捷径），难以泛化至真实场景，且大型语言模型（LLM）加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出TruthOverTricks评估范式，分类捷径行为，评估七种检测器；并设计SMF框架，通过数据增强减少捷径依赖。

Result: 实验显示现有检测器在自然和对抗性捷径下性能显著下降，SMF在16个基准测试中提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SMF有效减少捷径依赖，促进虚假信息检测器发展，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Misinformation detection models often rely on superficial cues (i.e.,
\emph{shortcuts}) that correlate with misinformation in training data but fail
to generalize to the diverse and evolving nature of real-world misinformation.
This issue is exacerbated by large language models (LLMs), which can easily
generate convincing misinformation through simple prompts. We introduce
TruthOverTricks, a unified evaluation paradigm for measuring shortcut learning
in misinformation detection. TruthOverTricks categorizes shortcut behaviors
into intrinsic shortcut induction and extrinsic shortcut injection, and
evaluates seven representative detectors across 14 popular benchmarks, along
with two new factual misinformation datasets, NQ-Misinfo and Streaming-Misinfo.
Empirical results reveal that existing detectors suffer severe performance
degradation when exposed to both naturally occurring and adversarially crafted
shortcuts. To address this, we propose SMF, an LLM-augmented data augmentation
framework that mitigates shortcut reliance through paraphrasing, factual
summarization, and sentiment normalization. SMF consistently enhances
robustness across 16 benchmarks, encouraging models to rely on deeper semantic
understanding rather than shortcut cues. To promote the development of
misinformation detectors, we have published the resources publicly at
https://github.com/whr000001/TruthOverTricks.

Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking
or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but
often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual
curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable.
We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight
summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language
reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and
Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances
selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures
both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of
purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean
Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9%
(WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines.
Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular,

Result: 微调后LLM输出安全性提升且不影响通用回答的实用性；12个日本LLM的安全性评估结果。

Conclusion: 数据集更新提供英文翻译和注释，便于其他语言和地区开发类似数据集。

Abstract: In this paper we present AnswerCarefully, a dataset for promoting the safety
and appropriateness of Japanese LLM outputs. The dataset consists of 1,800
pairs of questions and reference answers, where the questions require special
attention in answering. It covers a wide range of risk categories established
in prior English-language datasets, but the data samples are original in that
they are manually created to reflect the socio-cultural context of LLM usage in
Japan. We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese
LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general
responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese
LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark. Finally, we describe the latest update
on the dataset which provides English translations and annotations of the
questions, aimed at facilitating the derivation of similar datasets in
different languages and regions.

*Ukyo Honda,Tatsushi Oka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: X²-ICL通过系统探索所有可能标签的解释，提升了上下文学习的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICL在分布外数据上泛化能力不足，X-ICL通过解释提升可靠性，但仍需进一步优化。

Method: 扩展X-ICL，系统探索所有标签的解释（X²-ICL），实现更全面的决策。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解数据集上验证，X²-ICL显著提升对分布外数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: X²-ICL是一种有效的改进方法，显著增强了上下文学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond
the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in
enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves
prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the
reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an
advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations
for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and
robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language
understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating
significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the
existing ICL approaches.

*Chuanghao Ding,Jiaping Wang,Ziqing Yang,Xiaoliang Wang,Dahua Lin,Cam-Tu Nguyen,Fei Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Consultant Decoding (CD)的新机制，通过改进验证方法显著提升了大型语言模型(LLM)的推理速度，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speculative Decoding (SD)机制因高拒绝率导致效率提升受限，需要改进验证机制以优化性能。

Method: CD采用基于LLM计算的token级似然度验证候选草案，而非SD的重要性采样指标。

Result: CD实现了推理速度最高2.5倍的提升，生成质量接近目标模型的100%，且大模型调用频率降至10%以下。

Conclusion: CD不仅显著提升了效率，其性能甚至超过了理论上限，展示了在小模型辅助下大模型性能优化的潜力。

Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered
considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the
inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection
rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the
overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification
mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD).
Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for
verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods
computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference
speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation
quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is
achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of
magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model
to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even
found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents
the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Motivation: 当前GraphRAG模型的评估主要依赖传统问答数据集，无法全面评估其推理能力提升。

Method: 设计了包含大学水平、领域特定问题的基准测试，涵盖多跳推理、多样化任务类型和16个学科的教材内容。

Result: 通过测试九种GraphRAG方法，验证了GraphRAG-Bench在量化模型推理能力提升方面的实用性。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为研究社区提供了关于图架构、检索效果和推理能力的关键见解和行动指南。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing
recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by
structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex
reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely
on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions
and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity
improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce
GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\)
Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions
that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content
retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions
require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage.
The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice,
true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16
disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework.
GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG
pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer
generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence
of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to
GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based
structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals
critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning
capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence into educational
applications has enhanced personalized and interactive learning experiences,
and it shows strong potential to promote young learners language acquisition.
However, it is still challenging to ensure consistent and robust performance
across different languages and cultural contexts, and kids-friendly design

through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding
optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate
that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at
different performance levels.

Motivation: 探讨跨文化背景下英语教科书中的性别不平等问题，填补此前研究多限于单一国家的空白。

Method: 使用自然语言处理方法，量化分析22国教科书中的性别指标（如字符数、首次提及性别、TF-IDF词关联等），并测试大语言模型区分性别词列表的能力。

Result: 结果显示男性角色在数量、首次提及和命名实体上均占优，所有地区均存在性别不平等，拉丁文化圈差异最小。

Conclusion: 英语教科书中普遍存在性别不平等，需进一步推动性别平等教育。

Abstract: Textbooks play a critical role in shaping children's understanding of the
world. While previous studies have identified gender inequality in individual
countries' textbooks, few have examined the issue cross-culturally. This study
applies natural language processing methods to quantify gender inequality in
English textbooks from 22 countries across 7 cultural spheres. Metrics include
character count, firstness (which gender is mentioned first), and TF-IDF word
associations by gender. The analysis also identifies gender patterns in proper
names appearing in TF-IDF word lists, tests whether large language models can
distinguish between gendered word lists, and uses GloVe embeddings to examine
how closely keywords associate with each gender. Results show consistent
overrepresentation of male characters in terms of count, firstness, and named
entities. All regions exhibit gender inequality, with the Latin cultural sphere
showing the least disparity.

Conclusion: 为模块化、可泛化的基于LLM的结构化关系提取系统设计提供实用指导。

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information
extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex
relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of
three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation
classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures
explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task
decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation
mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation.
In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time
cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their
performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments
demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard
few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These
findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable
LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction. The source codes and

Motivation: 情感是人类体验的核心，但LLMs在模拟不同国籍角色时的情感表现是否带有刻板印象尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析预训练LLMs对不同国籍角色的情感分配，并与文化规范和人类情感反应对比。

Result: LLMs在情感分配上存在国籍差异，尤其是负面情感，且与人类反应不一致，显示出潜在的刻板印象。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟不同国籍角色时可能存在情感刻板印象，需进一步优化以减少偏见。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental facet of human experience, varying across
individuals, cultural contexts, and nationalities. Given the recent success of
Large Language Models (LLMs) as role-playing agents, we examine whether LLMs
exhibit emotional stereotypes when assigned nationality-specific personas.
Specifically, we investigate how different countries are represented in
pre-trained LLMs through emotion attributions and whether these attributions
align with cultural norms. Our analysis reveals significant nationality-based
differences, with emotions such as shame, fear, and joy being
disproportionately assigned across regions. Furthermore, we observe notable
misalignment between LLM-generated and human emotional responses, particularly
for negative emotions, highlighting the presence of reductive and potentially
biased stereotypes in LLM outputs.

Result: 实验表明，具备解密能力的模型可能因不匹配泛化攻击导致安全机制失效，产生不安全响应或过度拒绝。

Conclusion: 本文为理解LLM在长尾文本中的安全性提供了方向，并探讨了现有安全措施的优缺点。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs)
behavior on long-tail distributed (encrypted) texts and their safety
implications. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for assessing LLM
safety: (1) instruction refusal-the ability to reject harmful obfuscated
instructions, and (2) generation safety-the suppression of generating harmful
responses. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that models that
possess capabilities to decrypt ciphers may be susceptible to
mismatched-generalization attacks: their safety mechanisms fail on at least one
safety dimension, leading to unsafe responses or over-refusal. Based on these
findings, we evaluate a number of pre-LLM and post-LLM safeguards and discuss
their strengths and limitations. This work contributes to understanding the
safety of LLM in long-tail text scenarios and provides directions for
developing robust safety mechanisms.

crucial. However, the scarcity of high-quality data remains a fundamental
challenge to evaluating and improving this capability. Traditional dataset
construction methods are labor-intensive, resource-demanding, and raise privacy
concerns. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for automatic

Result: 实验表明，Multimodal DeepResearcher在相同模型下比基线方法整体胜率高出82%。

Conclusion: FDV和Multimodal DeepResearcher框架有效解决了多模态报告生成的挑战。

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and
information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation
have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate
comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks
primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated
generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel
task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and
effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we
propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual
representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse,
high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce
Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into
four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning,
and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated
multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100
diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive
experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness
of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet
model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the

TL;DR: 论文提出MidPO框架，通过混合专家（MoE）方法优化大语言模型的安全性与实用性，解决了现有方法在平衡两者时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，如何在保持实用性的同时增强安全性成为关键挑战。现有方法存在过度安全或适应性不足的问题。

Method: MidPO通过单偏好优化的直接偏好优化方法训练独立的安全性和实用性专家，并利用MoE框架动态分配两者的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，MidPO在安全性和实用性上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MidPO框架有效平衡了安全性与实用性，优于现有技术。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various
domains, enhancing safety while maintaining the helpfulness of LLMs has become
a critical challenge. Recent studies solve this problem through
safety-constrained online preference optimization or safety-constrained offline
preference optimization. However, the safety-constrained online methods often
suffer from excessive safety, which might reduce helpfulness, while the
safety-constrained offline methods perform poorly in adaptively balancing
safety and helpfulness. To address these limitations, we propose MidPO, a
\textbf{\underline{Mi}}xture of Experts (MoE) framework for safety-helpfulness
\textbf{\underline{d}}ual \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization. Firstly, MidPO devises single-preference
enhanced direct preference optimization approach to transform the base model
into two independent experts, termed safety and helpfulness experts, and
fine-tunes the two independent experts for optimal safety or helpfulness
performance. Secondly, to achieve an effective balance between safety and
helpfulness, MidPO incorporates the two experts into the MoE framework and
designs a dynamic routing mechanism to allocate contributions from each expert
adaptively. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three
popular datasets to demonstrate the proposed MidPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both safety and helpfulness. The code and models
will be released.

Method: 开发了XToM基准测试，涵盖五种语言和多样化的任务场景，并评估了LLMs（如DeepSeek R1）的表现。

Result: LLMs在多语言理解上表现优异，但在不同语言中的心理理论能力存在明显差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在跨语言环境中复制人类心理理论能力的能力有限。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to infer mental states in others, is
pivotal for human social cognition. Existing evaluations of ToM in LLMs are
largely limited to English, neglecting the linguistic diversity that shapes
human cognition. This limitation raises a critical question: can LLMs exhibit
Multilingual Theory of Mind, which is the capacity to reason about mental
states across diverse linguistic contexts? To address this gap, we present
XToM, a rigorously validated multilingual benchmark that evaluates ToM across
five languages and incorporates diverse, contextually rich task scenarios.
Using XToM, we systematically evaluate LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek R1), revealing a
pronounced dissonance: while models excel in multilingual language
understanding, their ToM performance varies across languages. Our findings
expose limitations in LLMs' ability to replicate human-like mentalizing across
linguistic contexts.

Result: FroM在多种微调场景中优于基线方法，显著缓解任务干扰。

Conclusion: FroM是一种无需训练数据的自适应合并方法，能有效提升模型合并性能。

Abstract: With the development of large language models, fine-tuning has emerged as an
effective method to enhance performance in specific scenarios by injecting
domain-specific knowledge. In this context, model merging techniques provide a
solution for fusing knowledge from multiple fine-tuning models by combining
their parameters. However, traditional methods often encounter task
interference when merging full fine-tuning models, and this problem becomes
even more evident in parameter-efficient fine-tuning scenarios. In this paper,
we introduce an improvement to the RegMean method, which indirectly leverages
the training data to approximate the outputs of the linear layers before and
after merging. We propose an adaptive merging method called FroM, which
directly measures the model parameters using the Frobenius norm, without any
training data. By introducing an additional hyperparameter for control, FroM
outperforms baseline methods across various fine-tuning scenarios, alleviating
the task interference problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法计算开销高或依赖模型优化能力，限制了广泛应用。

Method: ORPP通过小样本迭代优化生成高质量角色扮演提示，并利用少样本学习能力推广到其他样本。

Result: ORPP性能优于主流提示优化方法，并具备出色的即插即用能力。

Conclusion: ORPP为提示优化提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality prompts are crucial for eliciting outstanding performance from
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Existing research has explored
model-driven strategies for prompt optimization. However, these methods often
suffer from high computational overhead or require strong optimization
capabilities from the model itself, which limits their broad applicability.To
address these challenges, we propose ORPP (Optimized Role-Playing Prompt),a
framework that enhances model performance by optimizing and generating
role-playing prompts. The core idea of ORPP is to confine the prompt search
space to role-playing scenarios, thereby fully activating the model's intrinsic
capabilities through carefully crafted, high-quality role-playing prompts.
Specifically, ORPP first performs iterative optimization on a small subset of
training samples to generate high-quality role-playing prompts. Then,
leveraging the model's few-shot learning capability, it transfers the
optimization experience to efficiently generate suitable prompts for the
remaining samples.Our experimental results show that ORPP not only matches but
in most cases surpasses existing mainstream prompt optimization methods in
terms of performance. Notably, ORPP demonstrates superior "plug-and-play"
capability. In most cases, it can be integrated with various other prompt
methods and further enhance their effectiveness.

Motivation: 探索短形式测试与长形式输出中LLM价值偏好是否一致，以填补实际应用中价值相关风险的空白。

Method: 比较五种LLM（llama3-8b等）在短形式反应和长形式响应中的价值偏好，并分析不同参数设置的影响。

Result: 短形式与长形式偏好相关性弱；不同长形式设置间偏好一致性低；对齐方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的方法以确保LLM在多样化应用中的价值表达一致性。

Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on
short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves
long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences
in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value
preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in
long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences
elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number
of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences.
Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b),
we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from
short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2)
similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct
long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the
consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation
attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity
negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across
scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse
applications.

Conclusion: 神经与符号推理结合在多语言环境中效果显著。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to perform multi-target reasoning
in long-context scenarios where relevant information is scattered across
extensive documents. To address this challenge, we introduce NeuroSymbolic
Augmented Reasoning (NSAR), which combines the benefits of neural and symbolic
reasoning during inference. NSAR explicitly extracts symbolic facts from text
and generates executable Python code to handle complex reasoning steps. Through
extensive experiments across seven languages and diverse context lengths, we
demonstrate that NSAR significantly outperforms both a vanilla RAG baseline and
advanced prompting strategies in accurately identifying and synthesizing
multiple pieces of information. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
combining explicit symbolic operations with neural inference for robust,

TL;DR: 论文提出了Minos-Corpus数据集和Minos模型，通过结合人类和GPT的评估数据，在多模态生成任务中实现了最先进的评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作忽视了文本到图像生成任务的评估能力和大规模人类评估数据的结合。

Method: 提出Minos-Corpus数据集，结合人类和GPT的评估数据；采用数据选择与平衡、Mix-SFT训练方法，并应用DPO开发Minos模型。

Result: Minos在类似规模的开源评估模型中表现最佳，并在文本到图像生成任务评估中超越所有开源和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 高质量人类评估数据和联合训练在多模态评估任务中至关重要。

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid
progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general
evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the
development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task,
and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper,
we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that
combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains
evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based
on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training
methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built
upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among
all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation
performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source
models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly
training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

TL;DR: KARE-RAG通过结构化知识表示、DDPO训练目标和对比数据生成，显著提升了RAG管道的性能，尤其在处理噪声内容时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG扩展了LLMs的知识来源，但检索文档中的噪声仍导致事实不一致。提升生成模型处理噪声内容的能力是关键。

Method: 提出KARE-RAG，包含结构化知识表示、DDPO训练目标和对比数据生成，优化知识利用。

Result: 实验表明KARE-RAG显著提升RAG性能，适用于不同规模模型和任务，且数据效率高。

Conclusion: 通过改进模型处理检索内容的方式，KARE-RAG为RAG性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access broader knowledge sources, yet factual inconsistencies persist due to
noise in retrieved documents-even with advanced retrieval methods. We
demonstrate that enhancing generative models' capacity to process noisy content
is equally critical for robust performance. In this paper, we present KARE-RAG
(Knowledge-Aware Refinement and Enhancement for RAG), which improves knowledge
utilization through three key innovations: (1) structured knowledge
representations that facilitate error detection during training, (2) Dense
Direct Preference Optimization (DDPO)-a refined training objective that
prioritizes correction of critical errors, and (3) a contrastive data
generation pipeline that maintains semantic consistency while rectifying
factual inaccuracies. Experiments show our method significantly enhances
standard RAG pipelines across model scales, improving both in-domain and
out-of-domain task performance without compromising general capabilities.
Notably, these gains are achieved with modest training data, suggesting
data-efficient optimization is possible through targeted learning strategies.
Our findings establish a new direction for RAG improvement: by improving how
models learn to process retrieved content, we can enhance performance across
diverse inference paradigms. All data and code will be publicly available on
Github.

*Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Yalong Wen,Xiandong Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为M$^3$FinMeeting的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在金融会议理解中的表现，支持多语言、多行业和多任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金融领域的基准主要依赖新闻或报告，难以捕捉金融会议的真实动态，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 开发了M$^3$FinMeeting数据集，涵盖英语、中文和日语，覆盖多个行业，并包含摘要、问答对提取和问答三个任务。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进的长上下文模型在金融会议理解上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: M$^3$FinMeeting是一个有效的基准，能更全面地评估大语言模型在金融会议理解中的能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
development of new benchmarks for evaluating their performance in the financial
domain. However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles,
earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the
real-world dynamics of financial meetings. To address this gap, we propose a
novel benchmark called $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$, which is a multilingual,
multi-sector, and multi-task dataset designed for financial meeting
understanding. First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and
Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse
linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by
the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark
spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally,
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer
(QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and
comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven
popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have
significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of
$\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting
comprehension skills.

TL;DR: FinChain是首个用于验证链式思维（CoT）金融推理的符号基准，涵盖54个主题和12个金融领域，提供自动评估工具ChainEval，发现当前LLMs在多步金融推理中仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融数据集仅监督最终数值答案，缺乏对中间推理步骤的评估，因此需要FinChain来填补这一空白。

Method: FinChain通过54个主题和5种参数化模板生成数据集，包含可执行的Python跟踪，并引入ChainEval自动评估工具。

Result: 测试30个LLMs后发现，即使最先进的模型在多步金融推理中仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: FinChain为金融推理提供了系统性评估工具，推动了多步符号推理的研究。

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream
performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating
this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA
supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate
reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic
benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning.
Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five
parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and
domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python
trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy
adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for
automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning.
Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models
have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All
templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https:

TL;DR: COLLATE框架通过生成多样化推理路径并优化选择，提升小型LLM的推理能力，无需依赖大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因版权和法律问题无法使用大型LLM的问题，同时提升小型模型的独立推理能力。

Method: COLLATE通过多样化推理生成和偏好优化，选择最优推理路径以提升任务表现。

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上优于基线方法，适用于不同规模的模型（1B至8B）。

Conclusion: COLLATE为小型LLM提供了一种高效且独立的推理能力提升方案。

Abstract: LLMssuch as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions
by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this
capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters).
However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues,
owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed)
models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given
to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling
information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable
framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of
diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE
enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and
employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then
tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which
maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several
trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains: maths problem
solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the eff
icacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter
scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers
guided by the end task through ablations. Code is released here
(https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/collate).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于加权采样的对比学习方法，用于优化多语言嵌入模型，实现跨语言知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量知识库资源稀缺且语言有限的问题，促进高资源语言向低资源语言的知识迁移。

Method: 采用加权采样的对比学习策略微调多语言嵌入模型。

Result: 加权采样策略在MRR和Recall@3上分别提升了31.03%和33.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法语言无关，适用于多语言和代码混合场景。

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for
expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on
high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages,
therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different
languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language
becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to
transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones.
In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding
models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual
information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that
the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard
ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our
proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual
and code switching use cases.

Conclusion: 机器学习在提升政治在线讨论质量方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Political online participation in the form of discussing political issues and

formats being held digitally. To come to a decision, a careful discussion and
consideration of opinions and a civil exchange of arguments, which is defined
as the act of deliberation, is desirable. The quality of discussions and
participation processes in terms of their deliberativeness highly depends on
the design of platforms and processes. To facilitate online communication for
both participants and initiators, machine learning methods offer a lot of
potential. In this work we want to showcase which issues occur in political
online discussions and how machine learning can be used to counteract these
issues and enhance deliberation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在数学推理任务中，60%的推理步骤后即可稳定输出答案，剩余步骤冗余。作者提出三种推理时优化策略，显著减少计算成本且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维（CoT）提示虽增强推理能力，但导致冗余输出和计算成本增加，研究旨在探索最小必要推理步骤以提高效率。

Method: 提出三种策略：(1) 基于答案一致性的早期停止，(2) 增强结束信号生成概率，(3) 基于内部激活的监督学习方法。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种开源LLM中，方法显著减少计算量且准确性几乎无下降，如NaturalQuestions中节省40%以上计算量。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理时高效方法的重要性，为实际应用提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models
(LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing
inference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for
producing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic
study to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a
stable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models
typically converge to their final answers after 60\% of the reasoning steps,
suggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these
insights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1)
early stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of
generating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns
when to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks
and five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token
usage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions,
Answer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\% while further improving
accuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning
methods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态检索增强生成中的参数化与检索知识不一致（PRKI）及视觉与文本知识不一致（VTKI）问题。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：生成内部响应、选择多模态证据、生成外部响应、整合响应，并通过专门训练范式增强知识源判别与整合。

Result: 在KB-VQA基准测试中，CoRe-MMRAG在InfoSeek和Encyclopedic-VQA上分别实现了5.6%和9.3%的性能提升。

Conclusion: CoRe-MMRAG有效解决了多模态知识不一致问题，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to
enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved
multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved
Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and
retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and
Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between
visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{C}r\textbf{o}ss-source knowledge
\textbf{Re}conciliation for \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal \textbf{RAG}
(CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles
inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage
pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge,
then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity
assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to
produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm
enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified
answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG
achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6\% and
9.3\% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）需要大量计算资源，而现有剪枝方法通常关注保留模型的通用能力，导致性能下降或需要后训练。因此，需要一种更高效的剪枝方法。

Method: Cus-Prun方法通过识别并剪枝语言、领域和任务三个维度上的无关神经元，将大型通用模型转化为小型专家模型。

Result: 实验表明，Cus-Prun在不同模型家族和规模上均优于其他方法，专家和通用能力损失最小。

Conclusion: Cus-Prun是一种高效且无需后训练的剪枝方法，适用于生成轻量级专家模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational
resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it
is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who
often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios.
However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general
capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from
degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a
$\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to
prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is
positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying
and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates
expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that
$\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal
loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from
different model families and sizes.

Motivation: 研究印尼语境下区域特定LLM的安全性，因其在文化多样性环境中未被充分探索且对本地规范敏感。

Method: 扩展现有安全框架，构建印尼社会文化背景的分类法，创建IndoSafety数据集，并对LLM进行微调。

Result: 现有印尼中心LLM在口语和本地语言环境中常生成不安全输出，但微调IndoSafety能显著提升安全性且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: 强调文化基础安全评估的重要性，为多语言环境中负责任部署LLM提供具体步骤。

Abstract: Although region-specific large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
developed, their safety remains underexplored, particularly in culturally
diverse settings like Indonesia, where sensitivity to local norms is essential
and highly valued by the community. In this work, we present IndoSafety, the
first high-quality, human-verified safety evaluation dataset tailored for the
Indonesian context, covering five language varieties: formal and colloquial
Indonesian, along with three major local languages: Javanese, Sundanese, and
Minangkabau. IndoSafety is constructed by extending prior safety frameworks to
develop a taxonomy that captures Indonesia's sociocultural context. We find
that existing Indonesian-centric LLMs often generate unsafe outputs,
particularly in colloquial and local language settings, while fine-tuning on
IndoSafety significantly improves safety while preserving task performance. Our
work highlights the critical need for culturally grounded safety evaluation and
provides a concrete step toward responsible LLM deployment in multilingual
settings. Warning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive,

Motivation: 探索韵律在语言理解中的作用，尤其是独立于词汇内容时的贡献，以填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用自监督学习（SSL）构建Masked Prosody Model，分析韵律的声学相关结构，并通过探测实验验证其在不同感知标签（如词边界和情感识别）中的表现。

Result: SSL模型在长时结构（如情感识别）中表现优于传统声学特征（如基频、能量和语音活动），揭示了SSL训练目标时间尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 复杂SSL编码结构比传统结构更具价值，韵律在语言理解中的作用不仅限于局部信息，还涉及长时结构。

Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text
comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the
degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to
such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study
leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of
structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our
proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local
information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels
involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments
across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed
pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance
of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex
SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能像人类一样在不同测量系统中提供准确信息，以服务多元文化背景的用户。

Method: 使用新编译的数据集测试七个开源LLMs，研究其默认测量系统、性能差异及推理方法的效果。

Result: LLMs默认使用数据主导的测量系统，性能在不同系统中不稳定，推理方法可改善但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: LLMs在多元测量系统中的表现存在挑战，需进一步优化以减少对少数文化背景用户的边缘化。

Abstract: Measurement systems (e.g., currencies) differ across cultures, but the
conversions between them are well defined so that humans can state facts using
any measurement system of their choice. Being available to users from diverse
cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to
provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand.
Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source
LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system
used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their
accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate
potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our
findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in
the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in
performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in
part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought
(CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases
test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural
backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.

Conclusion: DBG分数提供了一种更准确的偏差测量方法，并揭示了影响偏差的因素和潜在机制。

Abstract: Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference
bias when serving as judges, meaning they tend to favor their own responses
over those generated by other models. Existing methods typically measure this
bias by calculating the difference between the scores a judge model assigns to
its own responses and those it assigns to responses from other models. However,
this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as
higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score
differences, even in the absence of bias. To address this issue, we introduce
gold judgments as proxies for the actual quality of responses and propose the
DBG score, which measures self-preference bias as the difference between the
scores assigned by the judge model to its own responses and the corresponding
gold judgments. Since gold judgments reflect true response quality, the DBG
score mitigates the confounding effect of response quality on bias measurement.
Using the DBG score, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess
self-preference bias across LLMs of varying versions, sizes, and reasoning
abilities. Additionally, we investigate two factors that influence and help
alleviate self-preference bias: response text style and the post-training data
of judge models. Finally, we explore potential underlying mechanisms of
self-preference bias from an attention-based perspective. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/zhiyuanc2001/self-preference.

### [64] [EssayBench: Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Genre Chinese Essay Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02596)
*Fan Gao,Dongyuan Li,Ding Xia,Fei Mi,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Baojun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多体裁的中文写作基准（\benchName），用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在四种主要文体中的表现，并开发了细粒度的评分框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在中文写作评估中忽视结构和修辞复杂性，尤其是跨体裁的差异。

Method: 构建包含728个真实提示的多体裁数据集，分为开放和约束两类，并开发细粒度评分框架。

Result: 评估了15个大型语言模型，分析了其在不同体裁和指令类型中的表现。

Conclusion: \benchName为中文写作评估提供了新基准，并推动教育场景中LLM生成文本的改进研究。

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational
contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain
remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained
text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical
complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address
this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed
for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative,
Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world
prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the
\textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing
scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained,
genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We
further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human
agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their
strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName,
we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future
research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

### [65] [Overcoming Data Scarcity in Multi-Dialectal Arabic ASR via Whisper Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02627)
*Ömer Tarik Özyilmaz,Matt Coler,Matias Valdenegro-Toro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了通过微调Whisper模型提升阿拉伯方言ASR性能，发现少量MSA数据微调即可显著提升小模型表现，方言数据池化模型效果接近方言专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业阿拉伯ASR系统对现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）支持较好，但对阿拉伯方言表现不佳，需研究如何提升方言识别性能。

Method: 使用Mozilla Common Voice的MSA数据和MASC方言数据集，微调OpenAI的Whisper模型，评估MSA训练数据量、MSA预训练效果及方言专用与池化模型的差异。

Result: 少量MSA微调数据显著提升小模型性能；MSA预训练效果有限；方言池化模型表现接近方言专用模型。

Conclusion: 方言数据池化在平衡条件下可缓解低资源ASR数据不足问题，且性能损失小。

Abstract: Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We
investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic
dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common
Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA
training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and
dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of
MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models,
matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal
benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our
dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This
indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address
data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.

*Manon Reusens,Bart Baesens,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种标准化框架，用于分析个性化大语言模型（LLMs）在不同任务和运行中保持一致的响应能力。研究发现，一致性受多种因素影响，包括设定的人物角色、刻板印象和模型设计选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对不同人物角色和任务类型下LLMs一致性的全面分析，因此需要一种标准化框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 引入了一个新框架，评估LLMs在四种人物角色类别（快乐、职业、个性和政治立场）和多种任务维度（调查写作、文章生成、社交媒体帖子生成、单轮和多轮对话）中的一致性。

Result: 研究发现，一致性受人物角色、刻板印象和模型设计的影响，且在结构化任务和附加上下文中表现更好。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估LLMs的一致性提供了标准化方法，揭示了影响一致性的关键因素，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in diverse
applications, where they are assigned a specific persona - such as a happy high
school teacher - to guide their responses. While prior research has examined
how well LLMs adhere to predefined personas in writing style, a comprehensive
analysis of consistency across different personas and task types is lacking. In
this paper, we introduce a new standardized framework to analyze consistency in
persona-assigned LLMs. We define consistency as the extent to which a model
maintains coherent responses when assigned the same persona across different
tasks and runs. Our framework evaluates personas across four different
categories (happiness, occupation, personality, and political stance) spanning
multiple task dimensions (survey writing, essay generation, social media post
generation, single turn, and multi-turn conversations). Our findings reveal
that consistency is influenced by multiple factors, including the assigned
persona, stereotypes, and model design choices. Consistency also varies across
tasks, increasing with more structured tasks and additional context. All code
is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有基准多并行评估模型，而EvaLearn关注模型在序列任务中的学习能力，填补了模型潜力评估的空白。

Method: 设计182个任务序列，包含六类任务，通过五种自动化指标评估模型的学习能力和效率。

Result: 不同模型表现各异，部分模型（如Claude-3.7-sonnet）学习能力强，而部分模型难以从经验中受益。

Conclusion: EvaLearn为评估LLM潜力提供了新视角，揭示了静态能力与学习能力的差异，促进更动态的评估方法发展。

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in
challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential.
EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into
182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most
existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models
to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained
from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics
to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We
extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance
profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial
performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to
benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we
investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that
instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model
learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static
abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all
tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model
performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for
assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human
capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation
approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results
studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在长输出推理时的效率问题。

Method: 动态平衡System-1和System-2数据的权重，消除冗余推理过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少输出令牌数量40%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需复杂数据标注或多模型插值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by
leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language
reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn
increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a
dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data
annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance
the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate
redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning
capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying
difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens
by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and
data will be available soon.

Motivation: 现有规划方法存在严格约束和级联错误的问题，限制了LLM在规划任务中的表现。

Method: DPPM将复杂任务分解为子任务，并行生成子计划并合并为全局计划，同时引入验证和优化模块以修正错误。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPPM在旅行规划任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPPM通过并行规划和错误修正机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂规划任务中的性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), planning tasks
still present challenges for LLM-based agents. Existing planning methods face
two key limitations: heavy constraints and cascading errors. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel parallel planning paradigm, which Decomposes,
Plans for subtasks in Parallel, and Merges subplans into a final plan (DPPM).
Specifically, DPPM decomposes the complex task based on constraints into
subtasks, generates the subplan for each subtask in parallel, and merges them
into a global plan. In addition, our approach incorporates a verification and
refinement module, enabling error correction and conflict resolution.
Experimental results demonstrate that DPPM significantly outperforms existing
methods in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 高质量微调数据获取困难且成本高，需解决这一问题以提升模型性能。

Result: 构建BOOST-QA数据集，实验显示其能显著提升模型在多任务中的表现，特别是推理能力。

Conclusion: MASTER为数据增强提供了新思路，对复杂任务性能提升显著。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models'
instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However,
obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to
data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we
propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data
through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We
simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging
multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction
data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented
from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5.
Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization.
Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex
tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型内部表示如何捕捉命名实体的提及，解决实体提及的歧义性和变异性问题。

Method: 提出基于聚类分析的框架，量化同一实体的提及是否聚类、不同实体的提及是否分离，实验测试了五种Transformer自回归模型。

Result: 模型能有效识别和区分实体（精度和召回率0.66-0.9），实体信息集中在早期层的低维线性子空间。

Conclusion: 语言模型内部表示与实体知识结构存在同构性，揭示了模型如何组织和利用实体信息。

Abstract: We analyze the extent to which internal representations of language models
(LMs) identify and distinguish mentions of named entities, focusing on the
many-to-many correspondence between entities and their mentions. We first
formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and
propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we
quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to
which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different
entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based
autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish
entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to
0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly
represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers.
Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations
influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through
the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge
structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally
organize and use entity information.

TL;DR: 论文提出RACE-Align框架，通过结合外部知识检索和链式思维推理，优化LLMs在垂直领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在垂直领域中的准确性、领域推理和可解释性问题，传统方法如RLHF和DPO忽略了知识来源和推理逻辑。

Method: RACE-Align构建二元偏好数据集，结合AI驱动的知识检索和链式思维推理，使用DPO算法对齐LLMs。

Result: 在中医领域实验中，RACE-Align显著优于基础模型和仅用SFT微调的模型，提升了准确性、信息丰富度、推理逻辑等。

Conclusion: RACE-Align为增强LLMs在复杂垂直领域的知识应用、推理可靠性和过程透明度提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific
reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference
alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge
sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align
(Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel
framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically
constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO
algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction
strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing
knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of
domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference
dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively
generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that
RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model
fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed
across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness,
application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and
interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway
to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process
transparency in complex vertical domains.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何利用自然文本（尤其是Twitter）增强常识知识库中的性别刻板印象行为。

Method: 方法包括使用OMCS和Twitter用户性别信息，结合语料库和代词/姓名性别启发式方法计算性别偏见。

Result: 结果显示Spearman相关性为0.47，ROC曲线下面积为0.76，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论表明利用自然文本（特别是Twitter）增强常识知识库中的性别刻板印象行为是可行的，并提供了两个数据集。

Abstract: We extracted gender-specific actions from text corpora and Twitter, and
compared them to stereotypical expectations of people. We used Open Mind Common
Sense (OMCS), a commonsense knowledge repository, to focus on actions that are
pertinent to common sense and daily life of humans. We use the gender
information of Twitter users and Web-corpus-based pronoun/name gender
heuristics to compute the gender bias of the actions. With high recall, we
obtained a Spearman correlation of 0.47 between corpus-based predictions and a
human gold standard, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.76 when predicting
the polarity of the gold standard. We conclude that it is feasible to use
natural text (and a Twitter-derived corpus in particular) in order to augment
commonsense repositories with the stereotypical gender expectations of actions.
We also present a dataset of 441 commonsense actions with human judges' ratings
on whether the action is typically/slightly masculine/feminine (or neutral),
and another larger dataset of 21,442 actions automatically rated by the methods
we investigate in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展加剧了攻击性、暴力和粗俗语言的传播，这对社会和网络安全构成严重威胁。阿拉伯语的复杂性、方言变体和标记数据稀缺增加了检测难度。

Method: 通过多任务学习联合训练攻击性、暴力和粗俗语言检测任务，动态调整任务权重，并结合主动学习策略选择信息量大的样本进行训练，同时引入加权表情符号处理。

Result: 在OSACT2022数据集上，该框架取得了85.42%的宏F1分数，优于现有方法，且所需微调样本更少。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合多任务学习和主动学习可在资源受限环境下高效准确地检测攻击性语言。

Abstract: The rapid growth of social media has amplified the spread of offensive,
violent, and vulgar speech, which poses serious societal and cybersecurity
concerns. Detecting such content in Arabic text is particularly complex due to
limited labeled data, dialectal variations, and the language's inherent
complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-task
learning (MTL) with active learning to enhance offensive speech detection in
Arabic social media text. By jointly training on two auxiliary tasks, violent
and vulgar speech, the model leverages shared representations to improve the
detection accuracy of the offensive speech. Our approach dynamically adjusts
task weights during training to balance the contribution of each task and
optimize performance. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we employ an
active learning strategy through several uncertainty sampling techniques to
iteratively select the most informative samples for model training. We also
introduce weighted emoji handling to better capture semantic cues. Experimental
results on the OSACT2022 dataset show that the proposed framework achieves a
state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 85.42%, outperforming existing methods while
using significantly fewer fine-tuning samples. The findings of this study
highlight the potential of integrating MTL with active learning for efficient
and accurate offensive language detection in resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词汇评估方法通常关注上下文无关的词性（PoS）使用，而本文旨在通过结合LLMs和EVP，实现更精确的词汇使用评估。

Method: 结合LLMs和EVP，评估LLMs在L2学习者写作中为单个词汇分配熟练度的能力，解决多义性、上下文变化和多词表达等挑战。

Result: LLMs在词汇评估任务中表现优于基于PoS的基线方法，并能利用额外的语义信息提升性能。此外，研究还探讨了词汇熟练度与文章熟练度的相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs非常适合词汇评估任务，且该方法可用于验证EVP熟练度级别的一致性。

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency.
To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the
context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper
introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation
exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines
large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP
is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be
linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign
proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing,
addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and
multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to
exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We
also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level
proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the
EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of
vocabulary assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs在语义任务中表现出色，但在检测隐藏内容（如光学幻觉）时表现不佳，与人类本能能力形成鲜明对比。研究旨在揭示VLMs的局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 提出HC-Bench基准测试（112张含隐藏内容的图像），并开发SemVink方法：通过将图像缩放至低分辨率（32-128像素）消除视觉噪声。

Result: VLMs在HC-Bench上准确率极低（0-5.36%），而SemVink方法显著提升至>99%，暴露了VLMs过度依赖高层语义的缺陷。

Conclusion: VLMs需转向多尺度处理的混合模型，以弥补计算视觉与人类认知的差距，应用于医学影像、安全等领域。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core
human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated
images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a
benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing
that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit
prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to
an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink
(Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128
pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise.
This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning
over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work
urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging
the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in
medical imaging, security, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但计算和内存资源需求高。结构化矩阵表示是减少参数的有效方法，但未经微调的预训练模型权重矩阵难以准确表示为结构化矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM输出在特定正交变换下不变的特性，识别能显著提升权重矩阵在结构化类别中可压缩性的变换。

Result: 该方法适用于多种支持高效投影操作的结构化矩阵类型。

Conclusion: 通过正交变换优化权重矩阵的可压缩性，为减少LLMs资源需求提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive results in natural
language processing tasks but require a significant amount of computational and
memory resources. Structured matrix representations are a promising way for
reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems
unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be
accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To
overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under
certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be
leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the
compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is
applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient
projection operations. Code is available at

TL;DR: TO-GATE通过轨迹优化改进LLM的多轮对话，生成更有效的问题和任务对齐的总结，显著提升偏好引导任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自学习推理的方法难以识别最优对话轨迹并避免无关问题，限制了LLM在复杂任务中的表现。

Method: 提出TO-GATE框架，包含澄清解析器（生成最优提问轨迹）和总结器（确保任务对齐的最终回答），通过轨迹优化提升问题生成。

Result: 实验显示TO-GATE在标准偏好引导任务上比基线方法提升9.32%。

Conclusion: TO-GATE通过优化对话轨迹显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can effectively elicit human preferences through
multi-turn dialogue. Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative
clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a
questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches
based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue
trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question
generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key
components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning
trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The
trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation
questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental
results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods,
achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了历史文本中的命名实体识别（NER），比较了多种方法，包括传统CRF、spaCy模型、Transformer架构（如CamemBERT）和Flair序列标注模型，并在18世纪法语百科全书数据集上进行了实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文本中的NER面临语言非标准化、古旧拼写和嵌套实体等独特挑战，需要探索高效方法。

Method: 提出将NER任务分为token级和span级分类，并评估了生成式语言模型在低资源场景下的潜力。

Result: 实验表明，Transformer模型在嵌套实体上表现最佳，而生成式模型在标注数据稀缺时具有潜力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了历史NER的挑战，并建议结合符号和神经方法的混合策略以更好地处理早期现代法语文本。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts presents unique challenges
due to non-standardized language, archaic orthography, and nested or
overlapping entities. This study benchmarks a diverse set of NER approaches,
ranging from classical Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and spaCy-based models
to transformer-based architectures such as CamemBERT and sequence-labeling
models like Flair. Experiments are conducted on the GeoEDdA dataset, a richly
annotated corpus derived from 18th-century French encyclopedias. We propose
framing NER as both token-level and span-level classification to accommodate
complex nested entity structures typical of historical documents. Additionally,
we evaluate the emerging potential of few-shot prompting with generative
language models for low-resource scenarios. Our results demonstrate that while
transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance, especially on
nested entities, generative models offer promising alternatives when labeled
data are scarce. The study highlights ongoing challenges in historical NER and
suggests avenues for hybrid approaches combining symbolic and neural methods to
better capture the intricacies of early modern French text.

*Jintian Shao,Yiming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文认为Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 提示并非引发真正的抽象推理，而是通过结构约束引导大语言模型模仿推理形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳CoT提示引发大语言模型真实推理能力的普遍观点，提出其本质是结构约束。

Method: 理论分析CoT提示如何通过强制生成中间步骤，利用模型的序列预测和模式匹配能力。

Result: CoT提示通过约束输出序列模仿连贯思维过程，而非实现真实推理。

Conclusion: CoT提示是一种有效的结构约束工具，但并未实现真正的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrably enhanced the performance of
Large Language Models on tasks requiring multi-step inference. This success has
led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In
this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that
Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides
Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the
generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense
capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining
its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个名为Betthupferl的评估数据集，包含德国东南部三种方言（Franconian、Bavarian、Alemannic）和标准德语的语音数据，用于研究自动语音识别（ASR）模型对方言的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国方言在当前ASR研究中代表性不足，需要研究模型对方言变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含方言和标准德语转录的评估数据集，并测试多语言ASR模型在方言到标准德语的语音翻译中的表现。

Result: ASR模型输出在方言和标准德语转录之间存在差异，最佳模型有时会标准化语法差异，但更接近方言结构。

Conclusion: Betthupferl数据集为研究ASR模型对方言的鲁棒性提供了基础，模型在处理方言时表现出一定灵活性。

Abstract: Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are
underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To
enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present
Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in
three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian,
Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both
dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic
differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art
ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences
between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized
transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it
sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the
dialectal constructions.

TL;DR: CellPuzzles任务提出了一种新的细胞类型标注方法，通过考虑批次级细胞上下文和推理，优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在单细胞RNA测序数据标注中缺乏批次级上下文考虑和解释性推理，而人类专家则能基于领域知识为不同细胞簇标注独特类型。

Method: 提出CellPuzzles任务，要求为一批细胞分配独特类型；开发Cell-o1模型，通过监督微调和强化学习优化批次级标注性能。

Result: Cell-o1在批次级准确率上比最佳基线（OpenAI的o1）提升73%，并展现出专家级推理能力。

Conclusion: Cell-o1填补了现有模型在批次级标注上的不足，为单细胞数据分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of
single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate
this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering
batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast,
human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters
based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the
CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch
of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions,
and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label
uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on
CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0%
batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained
via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by
reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing
well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning
behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and
emergent expert-like reasoning. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的长上下文语言模型评估框架LongBioBench，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文语言模型评估方法（如真实任务和合成任务）存在局限性：真实任务复杂且易受数据污染，合成任务缺乏上下文连贯性。因此，需要一种兼具可控性和真实性的评估框架。

Method: 提出了LongBioBench基准，利用人工生成的传记作为受控环境，评估模型在理解、推理和可信度三个维度的表现。

Result: 实验评估了18个模型，发现大多数模型在语义理解和基础推理方面存在不足，且随着上下文长度增加，可信度下降。此外，现有合成基准的设计选择（如非连贯上下文、数值“针”）使其难以有效测试模型能力。

Conclusion: LongBioBench在真实性和可控性之间取得了更好的平衡，具有高可解释性和可配置性，优于现有合成基准。

Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating long-context language models (LCLM) can be
broadly categorized into real-world and synthetic tasks. Despite their utility,
both approaches are accompanied by certain intrinsic limitations. Real-world
tasks are too complex to interpret or characterize and are susceptible to data
contamination. In contrast, synthetic tasks often adopt the
needle-in-the-haystack (NIAH) format, wherein a lack of coherence between the
"needle" and the "haystack" compromises their validity as proxies for realistic
applications. In response to these challenges, we posit that an ideal
long-context evaluation framework should be characterized by three essential
features: $\textit{seamless context}$, $\textit{controllable setting}$, and
$\textit{sound evaluation}$. This study introduces $\textbf{LongBioBench}$, a
novel benchmark that utilizes artificially generated biographies as a
controlled environment for assessing LCLMs across dimensions of
$\textit{understanding}$, $\textit{reasoning}$, and $\textit{trustworthiness}$.
Our experimental evaluation, which includes $\textbf{18}$ LCLMs in total,
demonstrates that most models still exhibit deficiencies in semantic
understanding and elementary reasoning over retrieved results and are less
trustworthy as context length increases. Our further analysis indicates some
design choices employed by existing synthetic benchmarks, such as contextual
non-coherence, numerical needles, and the absence of distractors, rendering
them vulnerable to test the model long-context capabilities. Moreover, we also
reveal that long-context continual pretraining primarily adjusts RoPE embedding
to accommodate extended context lengths. To sum up, compared to previous
synthetic benchmarks, LongBioBench achieves a better trade-off between
mirroring authentic language tasks and maintaining controllability, and is
highly interpretable and configurable.

TL;DR: 团队通过微调基础模型并结合合成数据，在eRisk 2025任务1中取得了最佳表现，击败了其他16个团队。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务要求从句子中筛选与抑郁症症状相关的句子，但训练数据仅标注了句子是否与症状相关，因此团队将其视为二元分类任务。

Method: 团队将标注数据分为训练集和验证集，尝试了基础模型微调、句子相似度、大语言模型提示和集成方法。

Result: 微调基础模型表现最佳，尤其是结合合成数据缓解类别不平衡时。不同症状的最佳方法各异，最终提交的五个测试运行在官方评估中得分最高。

Conclusion: 基础模型微调结合合成数据是解决此类任务的有效方法，且需针对不同症状调整策略。

Abstract: In this work, we describe our team's approach to eRisk's 2025 Task 1: Search
for Symptoms of Depression. Given a set of sentences and the Beck's Depression
Inventory - II (BDI) questionnaire, participants were tasked with submitting up
to 1,000 sentences per depression symptom in the BDI, sorted by relevance.
Participant submissions were evaluated according to standard Information
Retrieval (IR) metrics, including Average Precision (AP) and R-Precision
(R-PREC). The provided training data, however, consisted of sentences labeled
as to whether a given sentence was relevant or not w.r.t. one of BDI's
symptoms. Due to this labeling limitation, we framed our development as a
binary classification task for each BDI symptom, and evaluated accordingly. To
that end, we split the available labeled data into training and validation
sets, and explored foundation model fine-tuning, sentence similarity, Large
Language Model (LLM) prompting, and ensemble techniques. The validation results
revealed that fine-tuning foundation models yielded the best performance,
particularly when enhanced with synthetic data to mitigate class imbalance. We
also observed that the optimal approach varied by symptom. Based on these
insights, we devised five independent test runs, two of which used ensemble
methods. These runs achieved the highest scores in the official IR evaluation,
outperforming submissions from 16 other teams.

Method: 使用回归模型训练，基于LLM法官的文本评估和分数，对齐人类评分。

Result: 实验证明定量法官能有效提升现有法官的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在计算效率和统计效率上优于监督微调，适用于人类反馈有限的应用场景。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge is a framework in which a large language model (LLM)
automatically evaluates the output of another LLM. We propose quantitative LLM
judges, which align evaluation scores of existing LLM judges to human scores in
a given domain using regression models. The models are trained to improve the
score of the original judge by using the judge's textual evaluation and score.
We present four quantitative judges for different types of absolute and
relative feedback, which showcases the generality and versatility of our
framework. Our framework is more computationally efficient than supervised
fine-tuning and can be more statistically efficient when human feedback is
limited, which is expected in most applications of our work. We validate these
claims empirically on four datasets using two base judges. Our experiments show
that quantitative judges can effectively improve the predictive power of
existing judges through post-hoc modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自适应图剪枝（AGP）的多智能体协作框架，通过动态优化智能体数量和通信拓扑结构，显著提升了任务适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通常采用固定数量的智能体和静态通信结构，限制了其适应不同任务复杂性的能力。

Method: AGP采用两阶段训练策略：首先独立训练软剪枝网络以确定任务特定的最优智能体数量和通信拓扑，然后在最大完全图中联合优化硬剪枝和软剪枝。

Result: 实验表明，AGP在六个基准测试中取得最优性能，性能提升2.58%至9.84%，同时显著减少训练步骤和令牌消耗。

Conclusion: AGP是一种高效、任务自适应且性能优越的多智能体协作框架，适用于多种任务类别。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent systems have shown remarkable
performance in various tasks, especially when enhanced through collaborative
communication. However, current methods often rely on a fixed number of agents
and static communication structures, limiting their ability to adapt to varying
task complexities. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Pruning (AGP), a
novel task-adaptive multi-agent collaboration framework that jointly optimizes
agent quantity (hard-pruning) and communication topology (soft-pruning).
Specifically, our method employs a two-stage training strategy: firstly,
independently training soft-pruning networks for different agent quantities to
determine optimal agent-quantity-specific complete graphs and positional masks
across specific tasks; and then jointly optimizing hard-pruning and
soft-pruning within a maximum complete graph to dynamically configure the
number of agents and their communication topologies per task. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach is: (1) High-performing, achieving
state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks and consistently generalizes
across multiple mainstream LLM architectures, with a increase in performance of
$2.58\%\sim 9.84\%$; (2) Task-adaptive, dynamically constructing optimized
communication topologies tailored to specific tasks, with an extremely high
performance in all three task categories (general reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation); (3) Token-economical, having fewer training
steps and token consumption at the same time, with a decrease in token
consumption of $90\%+$; and (4) Training-efficient, achieving high performance
with very few training steps compared with other methods. The performance will
surpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文档级的二元检测，忽视了人类与AI共同创作的文本，因此需要开发细粒度的检测方法。

Method: 提出HACo-Det数据集，通过自动流程生成带有词级标注的人类-AI共同创作文本，并改造七种文档级检测器用于词级检测。

Result: 实验表明，基于度量的方法在细粒度检测中表现较差（平均F1得分0.462），而微调模型表现更优且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 细粒度共同创作文本检测仍有挑战，需进一步分析影响因素（如上下文窗口）并改进现有方法。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating
the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature
primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting
texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this
paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI
coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward
coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a
dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic
pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing
document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we
evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection
tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct
fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models
show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we
argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We
further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and
highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for
improvement.

Conclusion: 该工作为现实应用中隐私保护、领域专业化的大语言模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results across
diverse domains, yet their development remains reliant on vast amounts of
publicly available data, raising concerns about data scarcity and the lack of
access to domain-specific, sensitive information. Federated Learning (FL)
presents a compelling framework to address these challenges by enabling
decentralized fine-tuning on pre-trained LLMs without sharing raw data.
However, the compatibility and performance of pre-trained LLMs in FL settings
remain largely under explored. We introduce the FlowerTune LLM Leaderboard, a
first-of-its-kind benchmarking suite designed to evaluate federated fine-tuning
of LLMs across four diverse domains: general NLP, finance, medical, and coding.
Each domain includes federated instruction-tuning datasets and domain-specific
evaluation metrics. Our results, obtained through a collaborative, open-source
and community-driven approach, provide the first comprehensive comparison
across 26 pre-trained LLMs with different aggregation and fine-tuning
strategies under federated settings, offering actionable insights into model
performance, resource constraints, and domain adaptation. This work lays the
foundation for developing privacy-preserving, domain-specialized LLMs for
real-world applications.

Motivation: LLMs在文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但存在事实不一致（幻觉）的问题。现有方法多关注输入或输出层面，忽略了内部信息细化过程和未成熟层的作用，且资源消耗大。

Method: 提出PLI方法，通过数学插值在相邻层之间插入未成熟层，扩展信息处理和传输深度。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上实验表明，PLI有效减少幻觉，多数情况下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PLI的成功与LLMs内部机制密切相关，代码和数据将公开以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text
understanding and generation. However, their tendency to produce factually
inconsistent outputs, commonly referred to as ''hallucinations'', remains a
critical challenge. Existing approaches, such as retrieval-based and
inference-time correction methods, primarily address this issue at the input or
output level, often overlooking the intrinsic information refinement process
and the role of premature layers. Meanwhile, alignment- and fine-tuning-based
methods are resource-intensive. In this paper, we propose PLI (Premature Layers
Interpolation), a novel, training-free, and plug-and-play intervention designed
to enhance factuality. PLI mitigates hallucinations by inserting premature
layers formed through mathematical interpolation with adjacent layers. Inspired
by stable diffusion and sampling steps, PLI extends the depth of information
processing and transmission in LLMs, improving factual coherence. Experiments
on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that PLI effectively reduces
hallucinations while outperforming existing baselines in most cases. Further
analysis suggests that the success of layer interpolation is closely linked to
LLMs' internal mechanisms. To promote reproducibility, we will release our code
and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous
bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and
backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study
of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been
limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In
this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue
model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in
English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a
large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's
performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a
multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the
trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and
meaningfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在初级医疗领域的潜力，特别是针对MRCGP考试问题的表现。

Method: 使用o3、Claude Opus 4、Grok3和Gemini 2.5 Pro回答100道MRCGP考试题，对比得分。

Result: o3得分99.0%，其他模型均为95.0%，显著高于医生平均分73.0%。

Conclusion: LLMs在初级医疗领域表现优异，支持其临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial
potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its
predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful
reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination
questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test
the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and
Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of
the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer
100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General
Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual
information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted
to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information.
Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against
correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was
99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the
same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially
exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the
same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of
the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not
substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for
LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care,
especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical
data.

Method: 比较了多种系统（SLT、MT、大型语言模型）在德语到英语和俄语到英语的习语翻译表现。

Result: SLT系统在习语翻译上表现显著下降，而MT系统和大型语言模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 需要在SLT架构中开发习语专用策略和改进内部表示。

Abstract: Idioms are defined as a group of words with a figurative meaning not
deducible from their individual components. Although modern machine translation
systems have made remarkable progress, translating idioms remains a major
challenge, especially for speech-to-text systems, where research on this topic
is notably sparse. In this paper, we systematically evaluate idiom translation
as compared to conventional news translation in both text-to-text machine
translation (MT) and speech-to-text translation (SLT) systems across two
language pairs (German to English, Russian to English). We compare
state-of-the-art end-to-end SLT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, Whisper Large
v3) with MT systems (SeamlessM4T SLT-to-text, No Language Left Behind), Large
Language Models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) and cascaded alternatives. Our results reveal
that SLT systems experience a pronounced performance drop on idiomatic data,
often reverting to literal translations even in higher layers, whereas MT
systems and Large Language Models demonstrate better handling of idioms. These
findings underscore the need for idiom-specific strategies and improved
internal representations in SLT architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体框架，通过结合方言代理和隐私政策代理，减少隐私政策问答系统中的方言偏见，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私政策的复杂性限制了不同人群的可访问性，现有系统在英语方言间存在性能差异，非标准方言使用者处于劣势。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括方言代理（将查询翻译为标准美国英语）和隐私政策代理（利用领域知识优化预测），无需重新训练或方言特定微调。

Result: 在PrivacyQA和PolicyQA数据集上，框架将GPT-4o-mini的零样本准确率分别从0.394提升至0.601和从0.352提升至0.464，优于或少样本基线。

Conclusion: 结构化智能体协作有效减少方言偏见，强调设计考虑语言多样性的NLP系统以确保隐私信息的公平获取。

Abstract: Privacy policies inform users about data collection and usage, yet their
complexity limits accessibility for diverse populations. Existing Privacy
Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across
English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties. We propose
a novel multi-agent framework inspired by human-centered design principles to
mitigate dialectal biases. Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which
translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving
dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using
domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require
retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across
models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves
GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from
0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without
additional training data. These results highlight the effectiveness of
structured agent collaboration in mitigating dialect biases and underscore the
importance of designing NLP systems that account for linguistic diversity to
ensure equitable access to privacy information.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过不同抽象层次的法律知识调节大型语言模型（LLMs），以检测仇恨言论，发现模型在法律评估中仍与专家存在差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估法律问题时需考虑法律体系及其抽象层次，但LLMs对此的理解尚不明确，因此研究如何调节LLMs以提升其法律评估能力。

Method: 提出并测试了在不同法律抽象层次上调节LLMs的方法，专注于德国刑法中仇恨言论的分类任务。

Result: 模型在法律专家评估仇恨言论时表现仍有显著差距，抽象法律知识调节的模型理解不足，具体法律知识调节的模型在目标群体识别上表现较好但行为分类困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在法律评估中仍需改进，特别是对抽象法律知识的理解和任务深度把握。

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific
legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to
statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs)
internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and
investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of
abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to
conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect
potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether
a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to
hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there
is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the
legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with
which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models
conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often
contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete
legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target
groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

TL;DR: OpenHands-Versa是一种通用AI代理，使用少量通用工具（如代码编辑、网页搜索等）在多样化任务中表现优异，超越专用代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理多为专用型，难以泛化。研究目标是找到最小通用工具集以实现多样化任务的高性能。

Method: 开发OpenHands-Versa代理，结合代码编辑、网页搜索、多模态浏览和文件访问等通用工具。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Multimodal、GAIA和The Agent Company三个基准测试中，性能超越专用代理，成功率分别提升9.1、1.3和9.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 通用代理OpenHands-Versa可行且高效，为未来研究提供了强基线。

Abstract: Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and
develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of
tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as
software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this
results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond
their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a
highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a
specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the
minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance
across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist
agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution,
web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly,
OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading
specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench
Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing
previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1,
1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing
state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target
domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist
agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline
for future research.

Conclusion: 信息检索方法在少样本场景下对口语理解任务有显著改进效果。

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home

develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the
reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques
rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated
examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown
exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided
with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by
leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt
that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR
methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

Method: 通过理论分析，探讨了VAPO框架在长期价值建模中的局限性，包括信用分配和价值函数表示能力等问题。

Result: 研究发现VAPO框架在长链推理中难以全面建模和利用长期价值，尤其是在稀疏奖励环境下。

Conclusion: 论文为理解当前RL在高级推理中的局限性提供了见解，并建议未来研究应关注更鲁棒的LLM代理开发。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex,
long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework,
despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces
fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep,
long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended
reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in
credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally
abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy
improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines
these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling,
aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest
future research for more robust LLM agents.

Result: 模型不仅提供多余且不准确信息，还加剧对稀有语言的偏见。

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring
correctness in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English
capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this
work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering
factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We
demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful
information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare languages.

Motivation: 研究现代长上下文语言模型在文学分析任务中的表现，尤其是其在全局叙事推理和细粒度文本分析方面的能力。

Method: 利用RELiC数据集构建基准任务，要求模型根据文学批评生成缺失的文学引文，并通过人工筛选和验证构建高质量子集。

Result: 封闭模型Gemini Pro 2.5准确率达62.5%，超过人类专家（50%），而最佳开源模型仅29.1%。模型在文学信号和生成控制方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: 尽管封闭模型表现优异，但在文学分析的复杂任务中仍面临挑战，需进一步研究。数据集和代码已公开以促进未来工作。

Abstract: How well do modern long-context language models understand literary fiction?
We explore this question via the task of literary evidence retrieval,
repurposing the RELiC dataset of That et al. (2022) to construct a benchmark
where the entire text of a primary source (e.g., The Great Gatsby) is provided
to an LLM alongside literary criticism with a missing quotation from that work.
This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors
the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both
global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a
high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human
verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini
Pro 2.5 can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In
contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting
a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models.
Despite their speed and apparent accuracy, even the strongest models struggle
with nuanced literary signals and overgeneration, signaling open challenges for
applying LLMs to literary analysis. We release our dataset and evaluation code
to encourage future work in this direction.

Method: 利用小模型预测分词器对大型模型的影响，并提出新的基于Zipf定律的内在指标。

Result: 分词器选择对英语任务影响较小，但对多语言任务有显著差异；新指标比文本压缩更能预测下游性能。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种高效的分词器评估框架，为未来语言模型开发中的分词器选择提供了指导。

Abstract: The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet
accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open
challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can
accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models
at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both
English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has
negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance
differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer
metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream
performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining
several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a
reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more
efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model
development.

Motivation: 现有强化学习仅依赖数值反馈存在性能瓶颈、自我反思效果有限和持续失败问题。

Method: 提出Critique-GRPO框架，整合自然语言和数值反馈，支持模型从初始响应和反馈中同时学习。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优于监督学习和纯强化学习方法，平均得分提升约4.5%至5%。

Conclusion: Critique-GRPO有效解决强化学习瓶颈，探索效率与响应长度无必然关联。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such
as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify
three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:
performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent
failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting
performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed
problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.
Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that
integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy
optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and
critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.
Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that
Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based
fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general
reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,
respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that
incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals
two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not
always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses
do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂电路设计中表现出高效性和泛化能力，标志着AI驱动电路设计的重大进展。

Abstract: Analog circuit topology synthesis is integral to Electronic Design Automation
(EDA), enabling the automated creation of circuit structures tailored to
specific design requirements. However, the vast design search space and strict
constraint adherence make efficient synthesis challenging. Leveraging the
versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose AUTOCIRCUIT-RL,a novel
reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for automated analog circuit
synthesis. The framework operates in two phases: instruction tuning, where an
LLM learns to generate circuit topologies from structured prompts encoding
design constraints, and RL refinement, which further improves the
instruction-tuned model using reward models that evaluate validity, efficiency,
and output voltage. The refined model is then used directly to generate
topologies that satisfy the design constraints. Empirical results show that
AUTOCIRCUIT-RL generates ~12% more valid circuits and improves efficiency by
~14% compared to the best baselines, while reducing duplicate generation rates
by ~38%. It achieves over 60% success in synthesizing valid circuits with
limited training data, demonstrating strong generalization. These findings
highlight the framework's effectiveness in scaling to complex circuits while
maintaining efficiency and constraint adherence, marking a significant
advancement in AI-driven circuit design.

Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models,
outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They
naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic
coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT

Conclusion: GUI-Actor无需微调VLM主干即可实现高效定位，保留通用能力的同时提升性能。

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual
grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution
based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work
formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these
approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,
inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the
dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of
visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we
propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its
core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align
a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the
model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line
with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the
most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.
Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved
generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B
even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7
with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by
incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced
action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone
frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous
state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying
VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its
general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge.
Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from
this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when
knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art
retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A
knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources,
but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled
data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a
specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work
proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale
neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM),
neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance
of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge
graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to
extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate
the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods
significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience
research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the
knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中分词器对字符序列概率的影响，提出了一种称为“分词偏差”的现象，并通过因果效应估计方法量化了这种偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常基于子词序列训练，但最终定义的是字符序列的概率。理想情况下，分词器的选择不应影响字符序列的概率，但实际上存在偏差。本文旨在量化这种偏差。

Method: 通过回归不连续性设计（RDD）将分词偏差视为因果效应，并利用分词算法对子词排序的特性，比较临界点附近的子词来估计偏差。

Result: 实验表明，分词对模型输出有显著影响，尤其是在小型模型中，子词的存在可能使字符概率增加高达17倍。

Conclusion: 分词是语言模型设计中的关键选择，其偏差对模型性能有重要影响。

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but
ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of
the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect
the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it
does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify
one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a
subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the
probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,
\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model
is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation
bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity
design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank
subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an
arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing
similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation
consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and
tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may
increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting
tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

Abstract: This paper presents the second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition
Challenge (CNVSRC 2024), which builds on CNVSRC 2023 to advance research in
Chinese Large Vocabulary Continuous Visual Speech Recognition (LVC-VSR). The
challenge evaluates two test scenarios: reading in recording studios and
Internet speech. CNVSRC 2024 uses the same datasets as its predecessor CNVSRC
2023, which involves CN-CVS for training and CNVSRC-Single/Multi for
development and evaluation. However, CNVSRC 2024 introduced two key
improvements: (1) a stronger baseline system, and (2) an additional dataset,
CN-CVS2-P1, for open tracks to improve data volume and diversity. The new
challenge has demonstrated several important innovations in data preprocessing,
feature extraction, model design, and training strategies, further pushing the
state-of-the-art in Chinese LVC-VSR. More details and resources are available

*Minjae Lee,Minhyuk Seo,Tingyu Qu,Tinne Tuytelaars,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OASIS是一种自适应在线样本选择方法，用于持续视觉指令调整（CVIT），动态调整每批样本数量以减少冗余并应对分布变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CVIT场景中，大规模数据的训练延迟和未知未来数据导致现有方法（如固定样本选择）难以适应分布变化。

Method: OASIS通过动态调整每批样本数量和迭代更新选择分数，减少冗余并适应批间信息量变化。

Result: 实验表明，OASIS仅使用25%数据即可达到全数据训练性能，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OASIS为CVIT提供了一种高效且自适应的样本选择解决方案。

Abstract: In continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) scenarios, where multi-modal
data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from
large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. While existing data
selection strategies reduce training overheads, they rely on pre-trained
reference models, which are impractical in CVIT setups due to unknown future
data. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this
issue but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k),
causing them to suffer from distribution shifts where informativeness varies
across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive
online sample selection approach for CVIT that: (1) dynamically adjusts
selected samples per batch based on relative inter-batch informativeness, and
(2) minimizes redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score
updates. Empirical results across various MLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-VL-2.5, show that OASIS achieves comparable performance to full-data
training using only 25% of the data and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs已成功应用于VSR系统，但其潜力尚未充分挖掘，如何有效利用LLMs仍待探索。

Method: 1. 规模测试：研究LLM规模对VSR性能的影响；2. 上下文感知解码：通过添加上下文文本指导解码；3. 迭代优化：逐步修正LLM输出以减少错误。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法显著提升了VSR性能，充分挖掘了LLMs的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过系统性探索，本文展示了LLMs在VSR任务中的巨大潜力，并提供了有效的利用方法。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip
movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR
systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of
LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in
VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better
leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling
Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling
law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to
guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative
Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing
recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs,
the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant
VSR performance improvement.

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher
demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios.
Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge.
However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such
as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper
proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving
scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit
recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as
dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and
deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts
based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle,
enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The
dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a
high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's
generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced
techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization
are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting
performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method
not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also
achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the
practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在图像理解和生成方面取得了显著进展，但在细粒度视觉理解（尤其是文本到图像生成任务）中仍存在不足，且偏好优化方法在此领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: OSPO框架利用MLLMs的内在推理能力，无需外部数据集或模型，通过对象中心提示扰动、密集化和VQA评分自主构建高质量偏好对数据。

Result: 在三个代表性的文本到图像生成基准测试中，OSPO显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: OSPO通过自改进机制和高质量偏好对数据，有效提升了MLLMs在文本到图像生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved both image understanding and generation capabilities.
Despite these improvements, MLLMs still struggle with fine-grained visual
comprehension, particularly in text-to-image generation tasks. While preference
optimization methods have been explored to address these limitations in image
understanding tasks, their application to image generation remains largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving
Preference Optimization (OSPO) framework designed for text-to-image generation
by MLLMs. OSPO leverages the intrinsic reasoning abilities of MLLMs without
requiring any external datasets or models. OSPO emphasizes the importance of
high-quality preference pair data, which is critical for effective preference
optimization. To achieve this, it introduces a self-improving mechanism that
autonomously constructs object-level contrastive preference pairs through
object-centric prompt perturbation, densification and VQA scoring. This process
eliminates ambiguous or disproportionate variations commonly found in naively
generated preference pairs, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of preference
optimization. We validate OSPO on three representative compositional
text-to-image benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains over
baseline models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统DNN对抗鲁棒性弱，对抗训练计算开销大，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 利用DNN每层输出特征的聚类特性，构建特征路径并计算其与类中心特征路径的相关性。

Result: 在ResNet-20上，干净准确率82.77%，对抗准确率44.17%；在ResNet-18上分别为80.01%和46.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了DNN的固有对抗鲁棒性，挑战了传统认知，且无需高计算开销。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have received increasing attention and it has been widely
recognized that classical DNNs have weak adversarial robustness. The most
commonly used adversarial defense method, adversarial training, improves the
adversarial accuracy of DNNs by generating adversarial examples and retraining
the model. However, adversarial training requires a significant computational
overhead. In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the
clustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive
Feedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example
detection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct
feature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths
and the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the
recognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial
accuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method
with 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits
a trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.
Furthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage
with respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent
adversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of
the weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动性别识别（AGR）系统的问题，提出需区分性别、性别表达和生理性别，并建议引入用户反馈机制以提高公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGR系统常基于生理性别分类，忽视了性别多样性，导致对非二元性别和性别不一致人群的不准确识别。

Method: 提出理论框架，区分性别、性别表达和生理性别，并建议在AGR系统中加入用户反馈机制。

Result: 通过用户反馈机制，AGR系统可以更公平地识别性别，减少误判。

Conclusion: AGR系统应尊重个体自我表达和决定权，引入反馈机制是实现这一目标的关键。

Abstract: Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread
application in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are
typically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based
on observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In
addition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of
view, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between
the categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto
which their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender
cannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR
tools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender
non-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR
systems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender
expression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic
misgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of
re-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be
recreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.
While implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing
the system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness
levels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that
we advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting
individuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.

Motivation: 尽管CLIP框架已成功扩展到多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），但硬负样本的挖掘及其对学习过程的具体贡献尚未深入研究。

Method: 通过分析info-NCE损失的梯度，提出显式放大硬负样本梯度的方法，并基于LLaVA-OneVision-7B架构训练模型。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中达到最优性能，结合自研MLLM QQMM后位居MMEB排行榜首位。

Conclusion: 显式梯度放大器方法有效提升了多模态嵌入的判别性，为对比学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in
recent years, the foundational Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)
framework has been successfully extended to MLLMs, enabling more powerful and
universal multi-modal embeddings for a wide range of retrieval tasks. Despite
these developments, the core contrastive learning paradigm remains largely
unchanged from CLIP-style models to MLLMs. Within this framework, the effective
mining of hard negative samples continues to be a critical factor for enhancing
performance. Prior works have introduced both offline and online strategies for
hard negative mining to improve the efficiency of contrastive learning. While
these approaches have led to improved multi-modal embeddings, the specific
contribution of each hard negative sample to the learning process has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
gradients of the info-NCE loss with respect to the query, positive, and
negative samples, elucidating the role of hard negatives in updating model
parameters. Building upon this analysis, we propose to explicitly amplify the
gradients associated with hard negative samples, thereby encouraging the model
to learn more discriminative embeddings. Our multi-modal embedding model,
trained with the proposed Explicit Gradient Amplifier and based on the
LLaVA-OneVision-7B architecture, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB benchmark compared to previous methods utilizing the same MLLM backbone.
Furthermore, when integrated with our self-developed MLLM, QQMM, our approach
attains the top rank on the MMEB leaderboard. Code and models are released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据集中的冗余问题尚未充分研究，现有方法假设所有视频语义的时间冗余一致，限制了其有效性。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）预测合成视频的最佳时间分辨率，并提出教师循环奖励函数更新RL代理策略。

Result: DAViD显著优于现有数据集蒸馏方法，性能大幅提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来更高效、语义自适应的视频数据集蒸馏研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and
models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of
research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a
promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with
significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,
while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets
remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the
presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across
different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal
redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their
effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video
Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the
optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop
reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution
based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach
significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial
improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on
more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

TL;DR: MLLMs在视觉感知上存在严重缺陷，即使答案正确也可能误解关键视觉元素。研究提出新基准测试，发现MLLMs表现远低于人类，尤其在复杂任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs的视觉感知能力不足，掩盖了其推理能力的潜在缺陷，需系统评估和改进。

Method: 引入“Do You See Me”基准测试，包含1,758张图像和2,612个问题，涵盖7个子任务，评估MLLMs的视觉技能。

Result: 人类准确率96.49%，而顶级MLLMs平均低于50%，任务复杂度增加时差距更大。

Conclusion: MLLMs需提升视觉感知的鲁棒性，尤其是在细节处理上。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show reasoning promise, yet their
visual perception is a critical bottleneck. Strikingly, MLLMs can produce
correct answers even while misinterpreting crucial visual elements, masking
these underlying failures. Our preliminary study on a joint
perception-reasoning dataset revealed that for one leading MLLM, 29% of its
correct answers to reasoning questions still exhibited visual perception
errors. To systematically address this, we introduce "Do You See Me", a
scalable benchmark with 1,758 images and 2,612 questions. It spans seven
human-psychology inspired subtasks in 2D and 3D, featuring controllable
complexity to rigorously evaluate MLLM visual skills. Our findings on 3 leading
closed-source and 5 major open-source models reveal a stark deficit: humans
achieve 96.49% accuracy, while top MLLMs average below 50%. This performance
gap widens rapidly with increased task complexity (e.g., from 12% to 45% in the
visual form constancy subtask). Further analysis into the root causes suggests
that failures stem from challenges like misallocated visual attention and the
instability of internal representations for fine-grained details, especially at
or below encoder patch resolution. This underscores an urgent need for MLLMs
with truly robust visual perception. The benchmark dataset, source code and
evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Do-You-See-Me.

Abstract: Learning alignment between language and vision is a fundamental challenge,
especially as multimodal data becomes increasingly detailed and complex.
Existing methods often rely on collecting human or AI preferences, which can be
costly and time-intensive. We propose an alternative approach that leverages
cycle consistency as a supervisory signal. Given an image and generated text,
we map the text back to image space using a text-to-image model and compute the
similarity between the original image and its reconstruction. Analogously, for
text-to-image generation, we measure the textual similarity between an input
caption and its reconstruction through the cycle. We use the cycle consistency
score to rank candidates and construct a preference dataset of 866K comparison
pairs. The reward model trained on our dataset outperforms state-of-the-art
alignment metrics on detailed captioning, with superior inference-time
scalability when used as a verifier for Best-of-N sampling. Furthermore,
performing DPO and Diffusion DPO using our dataset enhances performance across
a wide range of vision-language tasks and text-to-image generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一开放词汇分割与3D重建，推动具身AI应用发展。

Method: 基于MASt3R，引入轻量级蒸馏策略，从2D视觉骨干（如CLIP和DINOv2）转移语义特征。

Result: SAB3R在Map and Locate任务中表现优于MASt3R和CLIP单独使用，且在2D语义分割和3D任务中验证有效。

Conclusion: SAB3R为统一重建、识别与重组任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally
distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting
object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the
process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically,
Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and
segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves
as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a
practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To
tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote
as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer
vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method
transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP
and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary
frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs
cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying
MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the
Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic
segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了配准精度，还增强了变形可靠性，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in
computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to
oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking
tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of
therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy
and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their
clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a
novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable
deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal
reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense
displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our
method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement
field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient
refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations
when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and
abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from
the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy
to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between
implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method
generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and
matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its
potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancements of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have ushered in a new
phase of AI-generated content, marked by their growing ability to interpret and
follow user instructions. However, existing T2I model evaluation benchmarks
fall short in limited prompt diversity and complexity, as well as coarse
evaluation metrics, making it difficult to evaluate the fine-grained alignment
performance between textual instructions and generated images. In this paper,
we present TIIF-Bench (Text-to-Image Instruction Following Benchmark), aiming
to systematically assess T2I models' ability in interpreting and following
intricate textual instructions. TIIF-Bench comprises a set of 5000 prompts
organized along multiple dimensions, which are categorized into three levels of
difficulties and complexities. To rigorously evaluate model robustness to
varying prompt lengths, we provide a short and a long version for each prompt
with identical core semantics. Two critical attributes, i.e., text rendering
and style control, are introduced to evaluate the precision of text synthesis
and the aesthetic coherence of T2I models. In addition, we collect 100
high-quality designer level prompts that encompass various scenarios to
comprehensively assess model performance. Leveraging the world knowledge
encoded in large vision language models, we propose a novel computable
framework to discern subtle variations in T2I model outputs. Through meticulous
benchmarking of mainstream T2I models on TIIF-Bench, we analyze the pros and
cons of current T2I models and reveal the limitations of current T2I
benchmarks. Project Page: https://a113n-w3i.github.io/TIIF_Bench/.

propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision
strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable
correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on
individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant
information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this
method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification
tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey
similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and,
surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While
adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey
similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases
model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not
improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental
divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those
learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

*Aditi Tiwari,Farzaneh Masoud,Dac Trong Nguyen,Jill Kraft,Heng Ji,Klara Nahrstedt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fire360是一个用于评估消防场景中感知和推理能力的基准数据集，包含228个360度视频，支持五项任务，旨在提升AI在不确定环境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消防员在恶劣环境中常因感知失效受伤，现有AI系统在可靠性关键场景中表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 数据集包含多样化条件下的视频，标注了动作、物体位置和退化元数据，支持五项任务测试。

Result: 人类专家在TOR任务中表现优异（83.5%），而GPT-4o等模型表现较差，显示退化环境下推理能力不足。

Conclusion: 通过发布Fire360，旨在推动AI在不确定环境下的感知、记忆和推理能力提升。

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical
- scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year,
tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns
in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating
perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset
includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under
diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action
segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five
tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object
Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval
(TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged
counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant
recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag
significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing
Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see,
but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available
at: https://uofi.box.com/v/fire360dataset.

*Johannes Schusterbauer,Ming Gui,Frank Fundel,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff2Flow框架通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和从扩散预测中推导FM兼容速度场，高效地将预训练扩散模型知识迁移到流匹配（FM）中，提升性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础FM模型在微调时计算成本高，而扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）因高效架构和生态支持更具优势。Diff2Flow旨在解决如何高效地将扩散模型知识迁移到FM中的关键挑战。

Method: Diff2Flow通过时间步重缩放、对齐插值和从扩散预测中推导FM兼容速度场，系统性地桥接扩散模型与FM范式，实现直接且高效的FM微调。

Result: 实验表明，Diff2Flow在参数高效约束下优于朴素FM和扩散微调，并在多样下游任务中达到或超越现有最佳方法性能。

Conclusion: Diff2Flow为扩散模型与FM之间的知识迁移提供了高效解决方案，显著提升性能且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative tasks through high-fidelity
outputs, yet flow matching (FM) offers faster inference and empirical
performance gains. However, current foundation FM models are computationally
prohibitive for finetuning, while diffusion models like Stable Diffusion
benefit from efficient architectures and ecosystem support. This work addresses
the critical challenge of efficiently transferring knowledge from pre-trained
diffusion models to flow matching. We propose Diff2Flow, a novel framework that
systematically bridges diffusion and FM paradigms by rescaling timesteps,
aligning interpolants, and deriving FM-compatible velocity fields from
diffusion predictions. This alignment enables direct and efficient FM
finetuning of diffusion priors with no extra computation overhead. Our
experiments demonstrate that Diff2Flow outperforms na\"ive FM and diffusion
finetuning particularly under parameter-efficient constraints, while achieving
superior or competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code at
https://github.com/CompVis/diff2flow.

TL;DR: 通过改进视觉-语言对比学习框架，提出两种方法提升胎盘病理检测的效率和准确性，包括文本锚定的知识蒸馏和无监督预蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胎盘病理自动检测方法计算量大，限制了其实际部署。

Method: 提出文本锚定的视觉-语言对比知识蒸馏（VLCD）和无监督预蒸馏，以提升模型效率和准确性。

Result: 新方法在模型压缩和加速的同时，性能达到或超过教师模型，尤其适用于低质量图像。

Conclusion: VLCD提升了医疗视觉-语言对比学习方法的效率和可部署性，尤其适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting
and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in
AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports
for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However,
existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their
deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive
learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1)
text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new
knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2)
unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved
initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or
surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and
acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in
improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for
lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency
and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare
solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理的频率域方法，通过分析运动频率特性并设计损失函数和增强模块，提升扩散视频生成的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散视频生成方法依赖统计学习，缺乏对运动物理特性的建模，导致生成视频存在非物理伪影。

Method: 提出物理运动损失函数和频率域增强模块，通过频率域分析优化视频生成的物理合理性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动质量和物理合理性，且不影响视觉质量或语义对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习视频合成提供了结合物理约束的通用方法，连接了数据驱动模型与物理运动模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded
unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However,
current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast
datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion,
resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the
realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency
domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We
first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of
diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each
motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building
on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a
physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of
generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency
domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to
conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network
functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across
multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without
compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain
physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video
generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating
physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This
work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and
physics-based motion models.

Motivation: 传统视觉方法在非稳定视角和运动模糊等条件下性能下降，需更鲁棒的跨模态融合方法。

Method: 结合部分冻结的Whisper音频编码器和微调AV-HuBERT视觉骨干，引入跨模态对齐损失。

Result: 在Ego4D ASD基准测试中达到76.6% mAP，超越LoCoNet和STHG。

Conclusion: 预训练音频先验和对齐融合方法在真实场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric videos presents unique
challenges due to unstable viewpoints, motion blur, and off-screen speech
sources - conditions under which traditional visual-centric methods degrade
significantly. We introduce PAIR-Net (Pretrained Audio-Visual Integration with
Regularization Network), an effective model that integrates a partially frozen
Whisper audio encoder with a fine-tuned AV-HuBERT visual backbone to robustly
fuse cross-modal cues. To counteract modality imbalance, we introduce an
inter-modal alignment loss that synchronizes audio and visual representations,
enabling more consistent convergence across modalities. Without relying on
multi-speaker context or ideal frontal views, PAIR-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Ego4D ASD benchmark with 76.6% mAP,
surpassing LoCoNet and STHG by 8.2% and 12.9% mAP, respectively. Our results
highlight the value of pretrained audio priors and alignment-based fusion for
robust ASD under real-world egocentric conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rig3R是一种多视角3D重建模型，通过结合或推断相机设备结构，提升了姿态估计和场景重建的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DUSt3R）将图像视为无结构集合，限制了在同步设备场景中的效果。Rig3R旨在利用或推断设备结构以提升性能。

Method: Rig3R结合设备元数据（如相机ID、时间、姿态），构建设备感知的潜在空间，并联合预测点图和两种射线图（全局和设备中心）。

Result: Rig3R在3D重建、相机姿态估计和设备结构推断上达到SOTA，性能提升17-45% mAA。

Conclusion: Rig3R通过设备感知设计，显著提升了多视角任务的性能，且无需后处理。

Abstract: Estimating agent pose and 3D scene structure from multi-camera rigs is a
central task in embodied AI applications such as autonomous driving. Recent
learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in
multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured
collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from
synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure.
  To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview
reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and
learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata
including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space
that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and
two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig
raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps
allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata
is missing.
  Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose
estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned
methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single
forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.

Abstract: Despite advances in multimodal learning, challenging benchmarks for
mixed-modal image retrieval that combines visual and textual information are
lacking. This paper introduces a novel benchmark to rigorously evaluate image
retrieval that demands deep cross-modal contextual understanding. We present
two new datasets: the Entity Image Dataset (EI), providing canonical images for
Wikipedia entities, and the Mixed-Modal Image Retrieval Dataset (MMIR), derived
from the WIT dataset. The MMIR benchmark features two challenging query types
requiring models to ground textual descriptions in the context of provided
visual entities: single entity-image queries (one entity image with descriptive
text) and multi-entity-image queries (multiple entity images with relational
text). We empirically validate the benchmark's utility as both a training
corpus and an evaluation set for mixed-modal retrieval. The quality of both
datasets is further affirmed through crowd-sourced human annotations. The
datasets are accessible through the GitHub page:

Motivation: 在数据受限时，知识蒸馏的有效性受限于训练数据中的协变量偏移问题，尤其是虚假特征的影响。

Result: 在CelebA、SpuCo Birds和虚假ImageNet上，显著提升了最差组和平均组准确率，以及虚假mAUC。

Conclusion: 该方法在协变量偏移下优于现有扩散数据增强基线，提升了学生模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large foundation models trained on extensive datasets demonstrate strong
zero-shot capabilities in various domains. To replicate their success when data
and model size are constrained, knowledge distillation has become an
established tool for transferring knowledge from foundation models to small
student networks. However, the effectiveness of distillation is critically
limited by the available training data. This work addresses the common
practical issue of covariate shift in knowledge distillation, where spurious
features appear during training but not at test time. We ask the question: when
these spurious features are unknown, yet a robust teacher is available, is it
possible for a student to also become robust to them? We address this problem
by introducing a novel diffusion-based data augmentation strategy that
generates images by maximizing the disagreement between the teacher and the
student, effectively creating challenging samples that the student struggles
with. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves worst
group and mean group accuracy on CelebA and SpuCo Birds as well as the spurious
mAUC on spurious ImageNet under covariate shift, outperforming state-of-the-art
diffusion-based data augmentation baselines

Abstract: Providing effective treatment and making informed clinical decisions are
essential goals of modern medicine and clinical care. We are interested in
simulating disease dynamics for clinical decision-making, leveraging recent
advances in large generative models. To this end, we introduce the Medical
World Model (MeWM), the first world model in medicine that visually predicts
future disease states based on clinical decisions. MeWM comprises (i)
vision-language models to serve as policy models, and (ii) tumor generative
models as dynamics models. The policy model generates action plans, such as
clinical treatments, while the dynamics model simulates tumor progression or
regression under given treatment conditions. Building on this, we propose the
inverse dynamics model that applies survival analysis to the simulated
post-treatment tumor, enabling the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the
selection of the optimal clinical action plan. As a result, the proposed MeWM
simulates disease dynamics by synthesizing post-treatment tumors, with
state-of-the-art specificity in Turing tests evaluated by radiologists.
Simultaneously, its inverse dynamics model outperforms medical-specialized GPTs
in optimizing individualized treatment protocols across all metrics. Notably,
MeWM improves clinical decision-making for interventional physicians, boosting
F1-score in selecting the optimal TACE protocol by 13%, paving the way for
future integration of medical world models as the second readers.

Result: RLCD方法在七个GCD数据集上表现出色，显著提升了所有类别的性能。

Conclusion: RLCD通过RLF和CDR的组合，有效解决了GCD中的基类识别问题，性能优越且计算开销小。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify unlabeled samples by
leveraging the base knowledge from labeled ones, where the unlabeled set
consists of both base and novel classes. Since clustering methods are
time-consuming at inference, parametric-based approaches have become more
popular. However, recent parametric-based methods suffer from inferior base
discrimination due to unreliable self-supervision. To address this issue, we
propose a Reciprocal Learning Framework (RLF) that introduces an auxiliary
branch devoted to base classification. During training, the main branch filters
the pseudo-base samples to the auxiliary branch. In response, the auxiliary
branch provides more reliable soft labels for the main branch, leading to a
virtuous cycle. Furthermore, we introduce Class-wise Distribution
Regularization (CDR) to mitigate the learning bias towards base classes. CDR
essentially increases the prediction confidence of the unlabeled data and
boosts the novel class performance. Combined with both components, our proposed
method, RLCD, achieves superior performance in all classes with negligible
extra computation. Comprehensive experiments across seven GCD datasets validate
its superiority. Our codes are available at https://github.com/APORduo/RLCD.

Abstract: Object Navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied artificial
intelligence. Although significant progress has been made in semantic map
construction and target direction prediction in current research, redundant
exploration and exploration failures remain inevitable. A critical but
underexplored direction is the timely termination of exploration to overcome
these challenges. We observe a diminishing marginal effect between exploration
steps and exploration rates and analyze the cost-benefit relationship of
exploration. Inspired by this, we propose RATE-Nav, a Region-Aware
Termination-Enhanced method. It includes a geometric predictive region
segmentation algorithm and region-Based exploration estimation algorithm for
exploration rate calculation. By leveraging the visual question answering
capabilities of visual language models (VLMs) and exploration rates enables
efficient termination.RATE-Nav achieves a success rate of 67.8% and an SPL of

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂对象交互建模上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为交互中心视频理解研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation aims to segment the object in a video
corresponding to a given natural language expression. While prior works have
explored various referring scenarios, including motion-centric or
multi-instance expressions, most approaches still focus on localizing a single
target object in isolation. However, in comprehensive video understanding, an
object's role is often defined by its interactions with other entities, which
are largely overlooked in existing datasets and models. In this work, we
introduce Interaction-aware referring video object sgementation (InterRVOS), a
new task that requires segmenting both actor and target entities involved in an
interaction. Each interactoin is described through a pair of complementary
expressions from different semantic perspectives, enabling fine-grained
modeling of inter-object relationships. To tackle this task, we propose
InterRVOS-8K, the large-scale and automatically constructed dataset containing
diverse interaction-aware expressions with corresponding masks, including
challenging cases such as motion-only multi-instance expressions. We also
present a baseline architecture, ReVIOSa, designed to handle actor-target
segmentation from a single expression, achieving strong performance in both
standard and interaction-focused settings. Furthermore, we introduce an
actor-target-aware evalaution setting that enables a more targeted assessment
of interaction understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms prior methods in modeling complex object interactions for
referring video object segmentation task, establishing a strong foundation for
future research in interaction-centric video understanding. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路面分类（RSC）对提升道路安全和交通管理至关重要，尤其在自动驾驶中，准确的路面分类能帮助车辆更好地理解道路环境并调整驾驶策略。现有视觉分类方法忽视了细粒度分类（如相似路面纹理），因此需要更精细的分类方法。

Method: 提出了一种纯视觉的细粒度RSC方法，通过卷积和Transformer模块的堆叠融合局部与全局特征，并探索了最优特征提取策略。此外，设计了前景-背景模块（FBM）以提取路面的细粒度上下文特征。

Result: 在大规模路面数据集上，Top-1分类准确率达到92.52%和96.50%，相比现有方法提升了5.69%至12.84%。

Conclusion: RoadFormer在RSC任务中优于现有方法，显著提升了自动驾驶系统中路面感知的可靠性。

Abstract: The classification of the type of road surface (RSC) aims to utilize pavement
features to identify the roughness, wet and dry conditions, and material
information of the road surface. Due to its ability to effectively enhance road
safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent
years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand
the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more
efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been
favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the
exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar
pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained
RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global
feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer
modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature
extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In
addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large
intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we
propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts
fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification
ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement
dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized
from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and
96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods.
These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC
tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement
perception in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Great labels make great models. However, traditional labeling approaches for
tasks like object detection have substantial costs at scale. Furthermore,
alternatives to fully-supervised object detection either lose functionality or
require larger models with prohibitive computational costs for inference at
scale. To that end, this paper addresses the problem of training standard
object detection models without any ground truth labels. Instead, we configure
previously-trained vision-language foundation models to generate
application-specific pseudo "ground truth" labels. These auto-generated labels
directly integrate with existing model training frameworks, and we subsequently
train lightweight detection models that are computationally efficient. In this
way, we avoid the costs of traditional labeling, leverage the knowledge of
vision-language models, and keep the efficiency of lightweight models for
practical application. We perform exhaustive experiments across multiple
labeling configurations, downstream inference models, and datasets to establish
best practices and set an extensive auto-labeling benchmark. From our results,
we find that our approach is a viable alternative to standard labeling in that
it maintains competitive performance on multiple datasets and substantially
reduces labeling time and costs.

### [138] [A TRPCA-Inspired Deep Unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising via Thresholded t-SVD and Top-K Sparse Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02364)
*Liang Li,Jianli Zhao,Sheng Fang,Siyu Chen,Hui Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于张量鲁棒主成分分析（TRPCA）的深度展开网络（DU-TRPCA），通过紧密集成的低秩和稀疏模块交替优化，有效去除高光谱图像中的混合噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSIs）在采集和传输过程中常受复杂混合噪声影响，现有混合方法未能充分利用不同先验或模块的互补优势。

Method: 结合低秩模块（阈值张量奇异值分解）和稀疏模块（Top-K稀疏变换器），通过深度展开网络实现紧密耦合的交替优化。

Result: 在合成和真实HSIs上的实验表明，DU-TRPCA在严重混合噪声下优于现有方法，并提供可解释性和稳定的去噪动态。

Conclusion: DU-TRPCA通过紧密集成的模块交替优化，显著提升了高光谱图像去噪性能，同时保持了TRPCA的迭代优化优势。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often degraded by complex mixed noise during
acquisition and transmission, making effective denoising essential for
subsequent analysis. Recent hybrid approaches that bridge model-driven and
data-driven paradigms have shown great promise. However, most of these
approaches lack effective alternation between different priors or modules,
resulting in loosely coupled regularization and insufficient exploitation of
their complementary strengths. Inspired by tensor robust principal component
analysis (TRPCA), we propose a novel deep unfolding network (DU-TRPCA) that
enforces stage-wise alternation between two tightly integrated modules:
low-rank and sparse. The low-rank module employs thresholded tensor singular
value decomposition (t-SVD), providing a widely adopted convex surrogate for
tensor low-rankness and has been demonstrated to effectively capture the global
spatial-spectral structure of HSIs. The Top-K sparse transformer module
adaptively imposes sparse constraints, directly matching the sparse
regularization in TRPCA and enabling effective removal of localized outliers
and complex noise. This tightly coupled architecture preserves the stage-wise
alternation between low-rank approximation and sparse refinement inherent in
TRPCA, while enhancing representational capacity through attention mechanisms.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world HSIs demonstrate that
DU-TRPCA surpasses state-of-the-art methods under severe mixed noise, while
offering interpretability benefits and stable denoising dynamics inspired by
iterative optimization. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于颗粒球（GB）的近似边界采样方法（GBABS），通过限制扩散生成GB（RD-GBG）避免重叠，并结合异质最近邻概念实现边界采样和噪声数据集质量提升。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GB采样方法缺乏边界采样策略，且因GB重叠导致类边界模糊或收缩。

Method: 1. 提出RD-GBG方法，通过受限扩散避免GB重叠；2. 提出GBABS方法，基于异质最近邻实现边界采样和噪声数据集优化。

Result: 实验表明，GBABS在噪声数据集上表现优异，无需最优纯度阈值。

Conclusion: GBABS是首个能同时实现边界采样和噪声数据集优化的通用采样方法，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data sampling enhances classifier efficiency and robustness through data
compression and quality improvement. Recently, the sampling method based on
granular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy
classification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence
of borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or
shrinking due to overlap between GBs. In this paper, an approximate borderline
sampling method using GBs is proposed for classification tasks. First, a
restricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which
prevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric
representation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of
heterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling
(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable
of both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.
Additionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on
borderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets
without the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method
and several representative sampling methods. Our source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/CherylTse/GBABS.

*Jiayi Su,Dequan Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的架构ViTNF，用神经场（NF）分类器替换ViT中的MLP头部，显著降低了训练难度和样本需求，并在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT中的MLP头部训练成本高且未充分利用特征提取器的能力，因此需要一种更高效的分类器设计。

Method: 提出静态神经场函数描述神经场活动分布，构建由两个耦合静态神经场组成的NF分类器，替代MLP头部，简化训练流程。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100等数据集上，ViTNF在新类和所有类上的准确率分别提升了19%和16%。

Conclusion: ViTNF在广义类别发现任务中表现出显著优势，验证了神经场分类器的有效性。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a highly popular task in open-world
recognition, aiming to identify unknown class samples using known class data.
By leveraging pre-training, meta-training, and fine-tuning, ViT achieves
excellent few-shot learning capabilities. Its MLP head is a feedforward
network, trained synchronously with the entire network in the same process,
increasing the training cost and difficulty without fully leveraging the power
of the feature extractor. This paper proposes a new architecture by replacing
the MLP head with a neural field-based one. We first present a new static
neural field function to describe the activity distribution of the neural field
and then use two static neural field functions to build an efficient few-shot
classifier. This neural field-based (NF) classifier consists of two coupled
static neural fields. It stores the feature information of support samples by
its elementary field, the known categories by its high-level field, and the
category information of support samples by its cross-field connections. We
replace the MLP head with the proposed NF classifier, resulting in a novel
architecture ViTNF, and simplify the three-stage training mode by pre-training
the feature extractor on source tasks and training the NF classifier with
support samples in meta-testing separately, significantly reducing ViT's demand
for training samples and the difficulty of model training. To enhance the
model's capability in identifying new categories, we provide an effective
algorithm to determine the lateral interaction scale of the elementary field.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, and Standard
Cars, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements of 19\% and 16\% in new and all
classes, respectively, indicating a notable advantage in GCD.

Motivation: 动作预测任务需要处理不完整信息，传统方法仅依赖视觉模态，忽略了多模态信息的潜力。受人类行为启发，本文提出结合视觉和文本线索的多模态方法。

Method: 提出m&m-Ant方法，结合视觉和文本模态，并引入细粒度标签生成器和时间一致性损失函数。

Result: 在Breakfast、50 Salads和DARai数据集上实现了3.08%的平均准确率提升，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 多模态和层次化建模在动作预测中具有潜力，为未来研究设立了新基准。

Abstract: Action anticipation, the task of predicting future actions from partially
observed videos, is crucial for advancing intelligent systems. Unlike action
recognition, which operates on fully observed videos, action anticipation must
handle incomplete information. Hence, it requires temporal reasoning, and
inherent uncertainty handling. While recent advances have been made,
traditional methods often focus solely on visual modalities, neglecting the
potential of integrating multiple sources of information. Drawing inspiration
from human behavior, we introduce \textit{Multi-level and Multi-modal Action
Anticipation (m\&m-Ant)}, a novel multi-modal action anticipation approach that
combines both visual and textual cues, while explicitly modeling hierarchical
semantic information for more accurate predictions. To address the challenge of
inaccurate coarse action labels, we propose a fine-grained label generator
paired with a specialized temporal consistency loss function to optimize
performance. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets, including
Breakfast, 50 Salads, and DARai, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving state-of-the-art results with an average anticipation accuracy
improvement of 3.08\% over existing methods. This work underscores the
potential of multi-modal and hierarchical modeling in advancing action
anticipation and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测因目标小、暗、形状多变而具有挑战性，现有CNN方法虽有效但计算量大。

Method: 采用循环可重用卷积块（RuCB）和双交互注意力聚合模块（DIAAM），结合目标特性启发的损失函数（DpT-k loss）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，参数少且可作为插件提升其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: RRCA-Net在红外小目标检测中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is a challenging task due to its unique
characteristics (e.g., small, dim, shapeless and changeable). Recently
published CNN-based methods have achieved promising performance with heavy
feature extraction and fusion modules. To achieve efficient and effective
detection, we propose a recurrent reusable-convolution attention network
(RRCA-Net) for infrared small target detection. Specifically, RRCA-Net
incorporates reusable-convolution block (RuCB) in a recurrent manner without
introducing extra parameters. With the help of the repetitive iteration in
RuCB, the high-level information of small targets in the deep layers can be
well maintained and further refined. Then, a dual interactive attention
aggregation module (DIAAM) is proposed to promote the mutual enhancement and
fusion of refined information. In this way, RRCA-Net can both achieve
high-level feature refinement and enhance the correlation of contextual
information between adjacent layers. Moreover, to achieve steady convergence,
we design a target characteristic inspired loss function (DpT-k loss) by
integrating physical and mathematical constraints. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets (e.g. NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, DenseSIRST) demonstrate
that our RRCA-Net can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods while maintaining a small number of parameters, and act as a plug and
play module to introduce consistent performance improvement for several popular
IRSTD methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/yongxianLiu/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在夜间图像去雾中忽略昼夜亮度关系，导致合成图像与真实亮度不一致，且模型缺乏白天亮度知识。

Method: 提出数据合成管道模拟失真并保持亮度一致性，结合预训练扩散模型和亮度感知网络进行图像恢复。

Result: 实验验证了数据集的有效性及模型在去雾和亮度映射上的优越性能。

Conclusion: DiffND框架在夜间图像去雾和亮度重建方面表现出色。

Abstract: While nighttime image dehazing has been extensively studied, converting
nighttime hazy images to daytime-equivalent brightness remains largely
unaddressed. Existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) datasets
overlook the brightness relationship between day and night, resulting in the
brightness mapping being inconsistent with the real world during image
synthesis; and (2) models do not explicitly incorporate daytime brightness
knowledge, limiting their ability to reconstruct realistic lighting. To address
these challenges, we introduce the Diffusion-Based Nighttime Dehazing (DiffND)
framework, which excels in both data synthesis and lighting reconstruction. Our
approach starts with a data synthesis pipeline that simulates severe
distortions while enforcing brightness consistency between synthetic and
real-world scenes, providing a strong foundation for learning night-to-day
brightness mapping. Next, we propose a restoration model that integrates a
pre-trained diffusion model guided by a brightness perception network. This
design harnesses the diffusion model's generative ability while adapting it to
nighttime dehazing through brightness-aware optimization. Experiments validate
our dataset's utility and the model's superior performance in joint haze
removal and brightness mapping.

Motivation: 现有LiDAR语义分割模型在恶劣天气下精度下降，且少有研究关注点云的几何结构和反射强度异质性带来的负面影响。

Method: GRC框架采用双分支架构独立处理几何和反射特征，并通过多级特征协作模块抑制冗余信息。

Result: 实验表明GRC在恶劣天气下表现优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: GRC无需复杂模拟或增强，能有效提取场景本质信息并抑制干扰，提升鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation models often suffer from decreased
accuracy when exposed to adverse weather conditions. Recent methods addressing
this issue focus on enhancing training data through weather simulation or
universal augmentation techniques. However, few works have studied the negative
impacts caused by the heterogeneous domain shifts in the geometric structure
and reflectance intensity of point clouds. In this paper, we delve into this
challenge and address it with a novel Geometry-Reflectance Collaboration (GRC)
framework that explicitly separates feature extraction for geometry and
reflectance. Specifically, GRC employs a dual-branch architecture designed to
independently process geometric and reflectance features initially, thereby
capitalizing on their distinct characteristic. Then, GRC adopts a robust
multi-level feature collaboration module to suppress redundant and unreliable
information from both branches. Consequently, without complex simulation or
augmentation, our method effectively extracts intrinsic information about the
scene while suppressing interference, thus achieving better robustness and
generalization in adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of GRC through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, showing
that our method outperforms previous approaches and establishes new
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MAT为复杂图像篡改溯源提供了高效解决方案，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: As generative techniques become increasingly accessible, authentic visuals
are frequently subjected to iterative alterations by various individuals
employing a variety of tools. Currently, to avoid misinformation and ensure
accountability, a lot of research on detection and attribution is emerging.
Although these methods demonstrate promise in single-stage manipulation
scenarios, they fall short when addressing complex real-world iterative
manipulation. In this paper, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
systematically model this real-world challenge and introduce a novel method to
solve it. We define a task called "Modelship Attribution", which aims to trace
the evolution of manipulated images by identifying the generative models
involved and reconstructing the sequence of edits they performed. To
realistically simulate this scenario, we utilize three generative models,
StyleMapGAN, DiffSwap, and FacePartsSwap, that sequentially modify distinct
regions of the same image. This process leads to the creation of the first
modelship dataset, comprising 83,700 images (16,740 images*5). Given that later
edits often overwrite the fingerprints of earlier models, the focus shifts from
extracting blended fingerprints to characterizing each model's distinctive
editing patterns. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the modelship
attribution transformer (MAT), a purpose-built framework designed to
effectively recognize and attribute the contributions of various models within
complex, multi-stage manipulation workflows. Through extensive experiments and
comparative analysis with other related methods, our results, including
comprehensive ablation studies, demonstrate that the proposed approach is a
highly effective solution for modelship attribution.

Abstract: Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple
instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in
computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning
for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level
supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it
faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results.
These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work
neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance
disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we
pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention
MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through
global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With
the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet
with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm
across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally
efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath
and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is

Abstract: Diffusion models, while trained for image generation, have emerged as
powerful foundational feature extractors for downstream tasks. We find that
off-the-shelf diffusion models, trained exclusively to generate natural RGB
images, can identify semantically meaningful correspondences in medical images.
Building on this observation, we propose to leverage diffusion model features
as a similarity measure to guide deformable image registration networks. We
show that common intensity-based similarity losses often fail in challenging
scenarios, such as when certain anatomies are visible in one image but absent
in another, leading to anatomically inaccurate alignments. In contrast, our
method identifies true semantic correspondences, aligning meaningful structures
while disregarding those not present across images. We demonstrate superior
performance of our approach on two tasks: multimodal 2D registration (DXA to
X-Ray) and monomodal 3D registration (brain-extracted to non-brain-extracted
MRI). Code: https://github.com/uncbiag/dgir

Abstract: Multimodal functional neuroimaging enables systematic analysis of brain
mechanisms and provides discriminative representations for brain-computer
interface (BCI) decoding. However, its acquisition is constrained by high costs
and feasibility limitations. Moreover, underrepresentation of specific groups
undermines fairness of BCI decoding model. To address these challenges, we
propose a unified representation framework for multimodal functional
neuroimaging via generative artificial intelligence (AI). By mapping multimodal
functional neuroimaging into a unified representation space, the proposed
framework is capable of generating data for acquisition-constrained modalities
and underrepresented groups. Experiments show that the framework can generate
data consistent with real brain activity patterns, provide insights into brain
mechanisms, and improve performance on downstream tasks. More importantly, it
can enhance model fairness by augmenting data for underrepresented groups.
Overall, the framework offers a new paradigm for decreasing the cost of
acquiring multimodal functional neuroimages and enhancing the fairness of BCI
decoding models.

Result: 在两个VVI-ReID基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: VLD框架通过语言驱动和时空信息增强，有效解决了跨模态行人重识别的挑战。

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant
sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language
provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both
infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide
the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically
feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared
video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical
problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework,
video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules:
invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting
(STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the
prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align
them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP's multimodal space,
thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models
spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub
(STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by
incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates
and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame
across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated
identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH
focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD
framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. The
code will be released at https://github.com/Visuang/VLD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需依赖预定义对象模型或显式姿态指导，显著提升了视频与运动的一致性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation has significant application
potential. However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on
predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting
generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize
pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility.
Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental
physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines
visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process
to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the
heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements
tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D
full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore,
we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates
explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion
outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This
architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit
pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency.
Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art
approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences,
with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频事件的复杂结构和动态演化对AI理解构成挑战，需开发新方法和数据集。

Result: VidEvent数据集和基线模型为视频事件理解研究提供支持，展示了数据集的潜力。

Conclusion: VidEvent数据集和基线模型有望推动视频事件理解领域的发展，并鼓励新算法探索。

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition,
understanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their
complex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address
this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event
scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this
task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000
well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies,
and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was
created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and
reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering
detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These
models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and
improvements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the
dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the
exploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related
resources are publicly available at www.videvent.top.

*Wenshuo Chen,Kuimou Yu,Haozhe Jia,Kaishen Yuan,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Hongru Xiao,Erhang Zhang,Lei Wang,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANT提出了一种自适应神经时间感知架构，通过动态调整语义粒度，显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本到运动生成中忽略了时间频率需求，导致早期去噪需要结构语义而后期需要局部细节，与生物形态发生类似。

Method: ANT通过语义时间自适应模块（STA）、动态无分类器引导调度（DCFG）和时间语义重加权，动态调整语义粒度。

Result: 实验表明，ANT显著提升了模型性能，并在StableMoFusion上实现了最先进的语义对齐。

Conclusion: ANT通过时间感知的语义调整，有效解决了文本到运动生成中的时间频率需求问题。

Abstract: While diffusion models advance text-to-motion generation, their static
semantic conditioning ignores temporal-frequency demands: early denoising
requires structural semantics for motion foundations while later stages need
localized details for text alignment. This mismatch mirrors biological
morphogenesis where developmental phases demand distinct genetic programs.
Inspired by epigenetic regulation governing morphological specialization, we
propose **(ANT)**, an **A**daptive **N**eural **T**emporal-Aware architecture.
ANT orchestrates semantic granularity through: **(i) Semantic Temporally
Adaptive (STA) Module:** Automatically partitions denoising into low-frequency
structural planning and high-frequency refinement via spectral analysis. **(ii)
Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling (DCFG):** Adaptively adjusts
conditional to unconditional ratio enhancing efficiency while maintaining
fidelity. **(iii) Temporal-semantic reweighting:** Quantitatively aligns text
influence with phase requirements. Extensive experiments show that ANT can be
applied to various baselines, significantly improving model performance, and
achieving state-of-the-art semantic alignment on StableMoFusion.

### [153] [PAID: Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02453)
*Kunyu Wang,Xueyang Fu,Yunfei Bao,Chengjie Ge,Chengzhi Cao,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAID方法通过保留预训练权重中的成对角度结构，提出了一种简单有效的持续测试时间适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了预训练权重中未充分利用的领域不变先验信息，尤其是几何属性。

Method: 分析预训练权重的几何属性（大小、绝对角度、成对角度结构），提出PAID方法，分解权重为大小和方向，并引入可学习的正交矩阵以保持成对角度结构。

Result: PAID在四个CTTA基准测试中优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 保留成对角度结构是CTTA中简单而有效的原则。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

*Martin JJ. Bucher,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSpace是一个基于语言模型的生成框架，用于文本驱动的3D室内场景合成与编辑，通过结构化表示和双阶段训练实现高效编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在语义简化、编辑限制或空间推理方面存在不足，ReSpace旨在通过自然语言和结构化表示解决这些问题。

Method: 采用自回归语言模型，结合结构化场景表示和双阶段训练（监督微调与偏好对齐），支持对象添加、移除和场景编辑。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReSpace在对象添加上优于现有方法，同时在完整场景合成中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ReSpace通过语言模型和结构化表示，为3D场景合成与编辑提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer
graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify
object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'),
require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor
plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. In contrast, LLM-based
methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., 'modern studio with
light wood furniture') but do not support editing, remain limited to
rectangular layouts or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world
models. We introduce ReSpace, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor
scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach
features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room
boundaries that frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We
leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and
preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object
addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object
semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a
zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further
introduce a novel voxelization-based evaluation that captures fine-grained
geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass
state-of-the-art on object addition while maintaining competitive results on
full scene synthesis.

Result: 在三个基准测试中，方法在减少12%计算开销（FLOPs）的同时，性能优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算效率和适应性能之间取得了平衡，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptive object detection (CTTA-OD) aims to online adapt
a source pre-trained detector to ever-changing environments during inference
under continuous domain shifts. Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize
effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for
resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD
method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all
learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature
channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we
introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each
channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and
instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively
suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on
invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation
mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful
features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on
three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance
while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent
SOTA method.

Motivation: 中风康复需要精确跟踪患者动作，但现有方法难以实现细粒度和亚秒级动作检测。

Method: 使用单阶段Transformer模型HRTR，无需多阶段方法或后处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如StrokeRehab Video（ES 70.1）、StrokeRehab IMU（ES 69.4）和50Salads（ES 88.4）。

Conclusion: HRTR在细粒度和亚秒级动作检测任务中表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Stroke rehabilitation often demands precise tracking of patient movements to
monitor progress, with complexities of rehabilitation exercises presenting two
critical challenges: fine-grained and sub-second (under one-second) action
detection. In this work, we propose the High Resolution Temporal Transformer
(HRTR), to time-localize and classify high-resolution (fine-grained),
sub-second actions in a single-stage transformer, eliminating the need for
multi-stage methods and post-processing. Without any refinements, HRTR
outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both stroke related and general
datasets, achieving Edit Score (ES) of 70.1 on StrokeRehab Video, 69.4 on
StrokeRehab IMU, and 88.4 on 50Salads.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的方法，通过短视频生成物体的形状和材质图，解决了单视角下的感知模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过轻微移动或旋转物体来消除形状和材质的感知模糊，受此启发，研究如何通过动态观察提升视觉推理能力。

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，直接从像素空间训练，生成多模态的形状和材质图。

Result: 模型在静态观察下生成多样化的预测，动态观察下快速收敛到更准确的解释，并在真实物体上表现良好。

Conclusion: 通过动态观察，生成式感知方法可以提升物理系统中的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Perceiving the shape and material of an object from a single image is
inherently ambiguous, especially when lighting is unknown and unconstrained.
Despite this, humans can often disentangle shape and material, and when they
are uncertain, they often move their head slightly or rotate the object to help
resolve the ambiguities. Inspired by this behavior, we introduce a novel
conditional denoising-diffusion model that generates samples of
shape-and-material maps from a short video of an object undergoing differential
motions. Our parameter-efficient architecture allows training directly in
pixel-space, and it generates many disentangled attributes of an object
simultaneously. Trained on a modest number of synthetic object-motion videos
with supervision on shape and material, the model exhibits compelling emergent
behavior: For static observations, it produces diverse, multimodal predictions
of plausible shape-and-material maps that capture the inherent ambiguities; and
when objects move, the distributions quickly converge to more accurate
explanations. The model also produces high-quality shape-and-material estimates
for less ambiguous, real-world objects. By moving beyond single-view to
continuous motion observations, our work suggests a generative perception
approach for improving visual reasoning in physically-embodied systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过逐步扩展数据集提升图像去雨网络的适应性，结合GAN和知识蒸馏技术，模拟人脑学习机制，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因数据集有限，难以适应多样化的真实雨天场景，需提升网络的持续学习能力。

Method: 使用GAN捕获新数据特征，模拟海马体学习；结合知识蒸馏，模拟新皮层与海马体的协同作用，实现持续学习。

Result: 在三个基准网络上验证，框架能跨六数据集持续积累知识，泛化性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模拟人脑学习机制，有效提升去雨网络的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current image de-raining methods primarily learn from a limited dataset,
leading to inadequate performance in varied real-world rainy conditions. To
tackle this, we introduce a new framework that enables networks to
progressively expand their de-raining knowledge base by tapping into a growing
pool of datasets, significantly boosting their adaptability. Drawing
inspiration from the human brain's ability to continuously absorb and
generalize from ongoing experiences, our approach borrow the mechanism of the
complementary learning system. Specifically, we first deploy Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture and retain the unique features of new
data, mirroring the hippocampus's role in learning and memory. Then, the
de-raining network is trained with both existing and GAN-synthesized data,
mimicking the process of hippocampal replay and interleaved learning.
Furthermore, we employ knowledge distillation with the replayed data to
replicate the synergy between the neocortex's activity patterns triggered by
hippocampal replays and the pre-existing neocortical knowledge. This
comprehensive framework empowers the de-raining network to amass knowledge from
various datasets, continually enhancing its performance on previously unseen
rainy scenes. Our testing on three benchmark de-raining networks confirms the
framework's effectiveness. It not only facilitates continuous knowledge
accumulation across six datasets but also surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generalizing to new real-world scenarios.

*Hongtao Huang,Xiaojun Chang,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flexiffusion是一种无需训练的NAS框架，通过动态组合计算步骤类型（完整、部分、跳过）来优化扩散模型，显著降低计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因多步推理计算成本高，现有NAS方法受限于重训练需求、搜索复杂性和慢速评估。

Method: 将生成过程分解为灵活段，动态组合三种计算步骤类型，并引入轻量级评估指标rFID。

Result: 在多个模型上实现2倍以上加速，FID退化低于5%，Stable Diffusion上达到5.1倍加速。

Conclusion: Flexiffusion为高效搜索高质量扩散模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing
high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to
iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can
optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements,
exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation
relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose
Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation
schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our
key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of
equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full
(complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped
computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool
exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural
diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation
metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead
of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice,
Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable
Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$,
outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$
speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers
a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing
quality.

Motivation: 现有半监督图像分割方法未能充分利用多源体素级不确定性进行针对性学习。

Method: 1. 提出基于D-S证据理论的广义证据深度学习策略，改进不确定性测量；2. 引入信息量评估（IVUM），设计两种证据学习方案。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了方法的竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过改进不确定性测量和信息量评估，显著提升了半监督图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Although existing semi-supervised image segmentation methods have achieved
good performance, they cannot effectively utilize multiple sources of
voxel-level uncertainty for targeted learning. Therefore, we propose two main
improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion
strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional
D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each
voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled
information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and
unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass
function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two
evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by
combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty
measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential
fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.

Abstract: 3D plane reconstruction from a single image is a crucial yet challenging
topic in 3D computer vision. Previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have
focused on training their system on a single dataset from either indoor or
outdoor domain, limiting their generalizability across diverse testing data. In
this work, we introduce a novel framework dubbed ZeroPlane, a Transformer-based
model targeting zero-shot 3D plane detection and reconstruction from a single
image, over diverse domains and environments. To enable data-driven models
across multiple domains, we have curated a large-scale planar benchmark,
comprising over 14 datasets and 560,000 high-resolution, dense planar
annotations for diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To address the challenge of
achieving desirable planar geometry on multi-dataset training, we propose to
disentangle the representation of plane normal and offset, and employ an
exemplar-guided, classification-then-regression paradigm to learn plane and
offset respectively. Additionally, we employ advanced backbones as image
encoder, and present an effective pixel-geometry-enhanced plane embedding
module to further facilitate planar reconstruction. Extensive experiments
across multiple zero-shot evaluation datasets have demonstrated that our
approach significantly outperforms previous methods on both reconstruction
accuracy and generalizability, especially over in-the-wild data. Our code and
data are available at: https://github.com/jcliu0428/ZeroPlane.

Conclusion: LumosFlow框架有效提升了长视频生成的质量和连续性，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Long video generation has gained increasing attention due to its widespread
applications in fields such as entertainment and simulation. Despite advances,
synthesizing temporally coherent and visually compelling long sequences remains
a formidable challenge. Conventional approaches often synthesize long videos by
sequentially generating and concatenating short clips, or generating key frames
and then interpolate the intermediate frames in a hierarchical manner. However,
both of them still remain significant challenges, leading to issues such as
temporal repetition or unnatural transitions. In this paper, we revisit the
hierarchical long video generation pipeline and introduce LumosFlow, a
framework introduce motion guidance explicitly. Specifically, we first employ
the Large Motion Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (LMTV-DM) to generate key frames
with larger motion intervals, thereby ensuring content diversity in the
generated long videos. Given the complexity of interpolating contextual
transitions between key frames, we further decompose the intermediate frame
interpolation into motion generation and post-hoc refinement. For each pair of
key frames, the Latent Optical Flow Diffusion Model (LOF-DM) synthesizes
complex and large-motion optical flows, while MotionControlNet subsequently
refines the warped results to enhance quality and guide intermediate frame
generation. Compared with traditional video frame interpolation, we achieve 15x
interpolation, ensuring reasonable and continuous motion between adjacent
frames. Experiments show that our method can generate long videos with
consistent motion and appearance. Code and models will be made publicly
available upon acceptance. Our project page:

Conclusion: RelationAdapter为视觉提示驱动的图像编辑提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the in-context learning mechanism of large language models
(LLMs), a new paradigm of generalizable visual prompt-based image editing is
emerging. Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or
appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address
these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract
and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end,
we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual
transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a
comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model
generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments
on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's
ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in
generation quality and overall editing performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过弱监督和精心设计的损失函数，显著提升了高度估计的泛化性能，为大规模应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation is considered the most efficient and
cost-effective means of 3D perception in remote sensing, and it has attracted
much attention since the emergence of deep learning. While training neural
networks requires a large amount of data, data with perfect labels are scarce
and only available within developed regions. The trained models therefore lack
generalizability, which limits the potential for large-scale application of
existing methods. We tackle this problem for the first time, by introducing
data with imperfect labels into training pixel-wise height estimation networks,
including labels that are incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate compared to
high-quality labels. We propose an ensemble-based pipeline compatible with any
monocular height estimation network. Taking the challenges of noisy labels,
domain shift, and long-tailed distribution of height values into consideration,
we carefully design the architecture and loss functions to leverage the
information concealed in imperfect labels using weak supervision through
balanced soft losses and ordinal constraints. We conduct extensive experiments
on two datasets with different resolutions, DFC23 (0.5 to 1 m) and GBH (3 m).
The results indicate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baselines by
achieving more balanced performance across various domains, leading to
improvements of average root mean square errors up to 22.94 %, and 18.62 % on
DFC23 and GBH, respectively. The efficacy of each design component is validated
through ablation studies. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于重建或预测的视频异常检测方法存在两个问题：过度泛化导致异常事件难以区分，以及低层次特征无法捕捉高层次语义。

Method: 提出SFFM动态过滤异常信息，采用MoE架构提取多样化特征；结合VLM生成文本描述，实现多模态联合建模。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 新框架通过稀疏特征过滤和多模态建模，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction
face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often
results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it
difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on
low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify
high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First,
to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering
Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively
remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules,
it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset.
Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each
expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during
running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the
diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of
semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint
modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce
modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion
frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public
datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework
and sparse feature filtering paradigm. Project page at

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual
Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in
perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the
bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their
abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR,
featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities
across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we
introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for
generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only
generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides
fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over
intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and
model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles
empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal
bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of
contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

*Andreu Girbau-Xalabarder,Jun Nagata,Shinichi Sumiyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为POLED的概率框架，通过事件重要性概率密度函数（ePDF）动态评估事件重要性，支持在线自适应事件下采样，并引入零样本下采样技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高时间分辨率带来高带宽和计算需求，现有下采样方法依赖固定启发式策略，适应性不足。

Method: 提出POLED框架，利用ePDF动态估计事件重要性，支持在线自适应下采样，并设计轮廓保留ePDF。

Result: 在四个数据集和任务（分类、插值、表面法线估计、检测）中验证了智能采样对性能保持的重要性。

Conclusion: POLED框架通过动态事件重要性评估和自适应下采样，显著提升了事件相机在资源受限场景下的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,
enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 手术智能需要独特的视觉感知、时间分析和推理能力，现有通用视觉语言模型因缺乏领域特定监督和大规模高质量数据而无法满足需求。

Method: 构建SurgVLM-DB数据库（180万帧图像和779万对话），统一23个公开数据集，并基于Qwen2.5-VL进行指令调优，开发SurgVLM模型。

Result: SurgVLM在SurgVLM-Bench上表现优异，与14种主流商业模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash）相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SurgVLM填补了手术智能领域基础模型的空白，为多任务手术智能提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved transformative success across biomedical
domains by enabling holistic understanding of multimodal data. However, their
application in surgery remains underexplored. Surgical intelligence presents
unique challenges - requiring surgical visual perception, temporal analysis,
and reasoning. Existing general-purpose vision-language models fail to address
these needs due to insufficient domain-specific supervision and the lack of a
large-scale high-quality surgical database. To bridge this gap, we propose
SurgVLM, one of the first large vision-language foundation models for surgical
intelligence, where this single universal model can tackle versatile surgical
tasks. To enable this, we construct a large-scale multimodal surgical database,
SurgVLM-DB, comprising over 1.81 million frames with 7.79 million
conversations, spanning more than 16 surgical types and 18 anatomical
structures. We unify and reorganize 23 public datasets across 10 surgical
tasks, followed by standardizing labels and doing hierarchical vision-language
alignment to facilitate comprehensive coverage of gradually finer-grained
surgical tasks, from visual perception, temporal analysis, to high-level
reasoning. Building upon this comprehensive dataset, we propose SurgVLM, which
is built upon Qwen2.5-VL, and undergoes instruction tuning to 10+ surgical
tasks. We further construct a surgical multimodal benchmark, SurgVLM-Bench, for
method evaluation. SurgVLM-Bench consists of 6 popular and widely-used datasets
in surgical domain, covering several crucial downstream tasks. Based on
SurgVLM-Bench, we evaluate the performance of our SurgVLM (3 SurgVLM variants:
SurgVLM-7B, SurgVLM-32B, and SurgVLM-72B), and conduct comprehensive
comparisons with 14 mainstream commercial VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash,
Qwen2.5-Max).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于核的方法，将CLIP的视觉表示与DINOv2对齐，提升感知能力并保持与文本嵌入的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在细粒度感知上存在局限，影响下游多模态大语言模型性能，而DINOv2在细节捕捉上表现优异。

Method: 采用核方法对齐CLIP与DINOv2的视觉表示，设计高效随机优化目标。

Result: 对齐后的视觉编码器在零样本识别、细粒度空间推理和定位任务中表现显著提升，下游MLLM性能也增强。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了CLIP与DINOv2的优势，提升了多模态模型的感知能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have achieved significant success in
aligning visual and textual representations, becoming essential components of
many multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo.
However, numerous studies have identified CLIP's limited fine-grained
perception as a critical drawback, leading to substantial failures in
downstream MLLMs. In contrast, vision-centric foundation models like DINOv2
demonstrate remarkable capabilities in capturing fine details from images. In
this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to align CLIP's visual
representation with that of DINOv2, ensuring that the resulting embeddings
maintain compatibility with text embeddings while enhancing perceptual
capabilities. Our alignment objective is designed for efficient stochastic
optimization. Following this image-only alignment fine-tuning, the visual
encoder retains compatibility with the frozen text encoder and exhibits
significant improvements in zero-shot object recognition, fine-grained spatial
reasoning, and localization. By integrating the aligned visual encoder,
downstream MLLMs also demonstrate enhanced performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI) 是一种新框架，通过联合条件优化解决扩散模型中重建精度与编辑灵活性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的反演方法在重建精度和编辑灵活性之间存在固有权衡，难以同时保持语义对齐和结构一致性。

Method: DCI 通过双条件固定点优化问题，联合源提示和参考图像指导反演过程，最小化潜在噪声差距和重建误差。

Result: DCI 在多个编辑任务中表现优异，显著提升重建质量和编辑精度，并在重建任务中展现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DCI 通过双条件优化实现了更准确且可编辑的潜在表示，为反演过程提供了新理解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and
editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise
representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing,
and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer
from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing
flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both
semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In
this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework
that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the
inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a
dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent
noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design
anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to
more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new
understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks,
significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision.
Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in
reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability
approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失的短轨迹嵌入学习框架，优于传统方法，在语义和方向相似性检索中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算密集型启发式或缺乏可解释性的潜在锚表示，需要更高效、可解释的轨迹嵌入方法。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器和对比三元组损失，结合Cosine和FFT相似性度量，学习固定维度的轨迹嵌入。

Result: 在Argoverse 2数据集上，Cosine相似性目标生成的嵌入在语义和方向聚类中表现最佳，低维嵌入（如16维）在性能和计算开销间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了紧凑、语义明确且高效的轨迹表示，为实时系统中的运动预测提供了透明可控的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to retrieve semantically and directionally similar short-range
trajectories with both accuracy and efficiency is foundational for downstream
applications such as motion forecasting and autonomous navigation. However,
prevailing approaches often depend on computationally intensive heuristics or
latent anchor representations that lack interpretability and controllability.
In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional
embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained
with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative
feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and
FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a
focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term
maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates
that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior
clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes,
outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that
compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g.,
16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance
between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead,
aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors
in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically
meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust
alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more
transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR-相机校准方法依赖控制环境数据且无法适应动态变化，BEVCALIB旨在解决这一问题。

Conclusion: BEVCALIB在开源领域显著超越现有基线，为多模态感知融合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is fundamental to fusing multi-modal
perception in autonomous driving and robotic systems. Traditional calibration
methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot
compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In
this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features
to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve
this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse
them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric
information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to
filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces
memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on
KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a
new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the
best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI
dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation,
rotation), respectively. In the open-source domain, it improves the best
reproducible baseline by one order of magnitude. Our code and demo results are

Conclusion: 该模型在高光谱数据生成方面取得了进展，解决了高维度和物理约束问题。

Abstract: Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention,
but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which
limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for
their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from
RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and
physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion
model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an
unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing
autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task
from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly
reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance
diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of
non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the
reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored
to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional
metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of
generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an
advancement in hyperspectral data generation.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在超分辨率任务中因多步采样导致速度慢，且生成图像语义对齐不足，影响感知质量。

Conclusion: VPD-SR通过语义和高频优化，显著提升了一步超分辨率模型的效率和感知质量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have been widely used in various visual generation
tasks, showing promising results in image super-resolution (SR), while
typically being limited by dozens or even hundreds of sampling steps. Although
existing methods aim to accelerate the inference speed of multi-step
diffusion-based SR methods through knowledge distillation, their generated
images exhibit insufficient semantic alignment with real images, resulting in
suboptimal perceptual quality reconstruction, specifically reflected in the
CLIPIQA score. These methods still have many challenges in perceptual quality
and semantic fidelity. Based on the challenges, we propose VPD-SR, a novel
visual perception diffusion distillation framework specifically designed for
SR, aiming to construct an effective and efficient one-step SR model.
Specifically, VPD-SR consists of two components: Explicit Semantic-aware
Supervision (ESS) and High-Frequency Perception (HFP) loss. Firstly, the ESS
leverages the powerful visual perceptual understanding capabilities of the CLIP
model to extract explicit semantic supervision, thereby enhancing semantic
consistency. Then, Considering that high-frequency information contributes to
the visual perception quality of images, in addition to the vanilla
distillation loss, the HFP loss guides the student model to restore the missing
high-frequency details in degraded images that are critical for enhancing
perceptual quality. Lastly, we expand VPD-SR in adversarial training manner to
further enhance the authenticity of the generated content. Extensive
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
proposed VPD-SR achieves superior performance compared to both previous
state-of-the-art methods and the teacher model with just one-step sampling.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted
more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for
real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly
based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the
complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly
accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris,
enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train
and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset
Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data
simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562
frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset.
Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station,
achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability
to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 该方法在高效性和细节捕捉上取得平衡，适用于自动驾驶场景理解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for
scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with
detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language
model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the
vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the
inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene
understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of
generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree,
where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle
to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g.,
"Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite
direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped
based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted
answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent,
contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on
the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its
competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key
scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover,
qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's
capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

Result: 在感知质量指标（如LPIPS和FID）上优于现有方法，同时在图像失真指标（如PSNR和SSIM）上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ControlMambaIR在图像恢复任务中表现出灵活性和有效性，Mamba架构特别适合作为扩散模型的条件控制网络。

Abstract: This paper proposes ControlMambaIR, a novel image restoration method designed
to address perceptual challenges in image deraining, deblurring, and denoising
tasks. By integrating the Mamba network architecture with the diffusion model,
the condition network achieves refined conditional control, thereby enhancing
the control and optimization of the image generation process. To evaluate the
robustness and generalization capability of our method across various image
degradation conditions, extensive experiments were conducted on several
benchmark datasets, including Rain100H, Rain100L, GoPro, and SSID. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently surpasses existing methods
in perceptual quality metrics, such as LPIPS and FID, while maintaining
comparable performance in image distortion metrics, including PSNR and SSIM,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability. Notably, ablation experiments
reveal that directly noise prediction in the diffusion process achieves better
performance, effectively balancing noise suppression and detail preservation.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that the Mamba architecture is particularly
well-suited as a conditional control network for diffusion models,
outperforming both CNN- and Attention-based approaches in this context.
Overall, these results highlight the flexibility and effectiveness of
ControlMambaIR in addressing a range of image restoration perceptual
challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL是一种基于适配器的高效测试时适应框架，通过轻量级AdaptNet和梯度感知重置策略，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法计算成本高、扩展性差的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级AdaptNet与预训练VLM协作，通过置信度插值权重生成预测，并采用梯度感知重置策略防止遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算成本低。

Conclusion: SAIL高效、可扩展，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing
the generalization capability of vision-language models (VLMs) during
inference. However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational
costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation
granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation.
To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel
adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to
enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen
pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based
interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These
predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs
through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational
costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a
gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which
dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for
stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two
scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决跨域少样本分割（CD-FSS）中特征纠缠问题的新方法，通过分解ViT结构并学习权重来优化特征转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CD-FSS方法在特征转移时存在特征纠缠问题，限制了知识从源域到目标域的迁移效果。

Method: 通过分解ViT结构，分析特征纠缠问题，并提出一种学习权重的方法来优化特征比较。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在1-shot和5-shot设置下的平均准确率分别比现有最佳方法提高了1.92%和1.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了特征纠缠问题，提升了跨域少样本分割的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a
source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited
annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training
and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement
problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain
patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim
to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural
decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the
entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT
components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where
the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their
equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this
interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by
learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn
disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both
the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms
the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under
1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管流生成模型在图像生成中表现优异，但在逆成像问题中尚未达到类似效果，主要因非线性映射、数据似然难解及罕见模式恢复困难。

Method: 提出FLAIR框架，结合变分目标和轨迹调整，解耦数据保真度与正则化优化，并引入时间相关校准方案。

Result: 在标准成像基准测试中，FLAIR在重建质量和样本多样性上优于现有扩散和流方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR为逆问题提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了重建性能。

Abstract: Flow-based latent generative models such as Stable Diffusion 3 are able to
generate images with remarkable quality, even enabling photorealistic
text-to-image generation. Their impressive performance suggests that these
models should also constitute powerful priors for inverse imaging problems, but
that approach has not yet led to comparable fidelity. There are several key
obstacles: (i) the encoding into a lower-dimensional latent space makes the
underlying (forward) mapping non-linear; (ii) the data likelihood term is
usually intractable; and (iii) learned generative models struggle to recover
rare, atypical data modes during inference. We present FLAIR, a novel training
free variational framework that leverages flow-based generative models as a
prior for inverse problems. To that end, we introduce a variational objective
for flow matching that is agnostic to the type of degradation, and combine it
with deterministic trajectory adjustments to recover atypical modes. To enforce
exact consistency with the observed data, we decouple the optimization of the
data fidelity and regularization terms. Moreover, we introduce a time-dependent
calibration scheme in which the strength of the regularization is modulated
according to off-line accuracy estimates. Results on standard imaging
benchmarks demonstrate that FLAIR consistently outperforms existing diffusion-
and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial

survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core

and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm,
assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future
research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark

Result: SurgVISTA在13个视频级数据集上表现优异，超越自然和手术领域的预训练模型。

Conclusion: SurgVISTA在临床场景中展现出推动智能手术系统发展的潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize
modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical
component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and
ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate
annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their
lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts
the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete
spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level
surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal
representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this,
we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and
approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures
and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose
SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a
reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial
structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling.
Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided
by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical
and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a
comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six
surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain
pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent
surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别需要放大毫秒级低幅度面部运动并抑制身份特征，FaceSleuth旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用双流架构，包括CVA块增强垂直运动、Facial Position Focalizer定位信号，以及Action-Unit嵌入引导特征学习；引入SOA模块优化注意力方向。

Result: 在三个标准数据集上，FaceSleuth性能超越现有方法，最高达95.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 垂直注意力偏置是微表情识别的最优方向，FaceSleuth为领域提供了新基准。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify
millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing
identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream
architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical
axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the
resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical
cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically
meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether
the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a
Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction
end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses
to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably
drifts to 88{\deg}, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while
delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with
CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts
accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840
on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness.
These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide
empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative
orientation for MER.

Abstract: Controllable layout generation aims to create plausible visual arrangements
of element bounding boxes within a graphic design according to certain optional
constraints, such as the type or position of a specific component. While recent
diffusion or flow-matching models have achieved considerable advances in
multifarious conditional generation tasks, there remains considerable room for
generating optimal arrangements under given conditions. In this work, we
propose to carry out layout generation through retrieving by conditions and
reference-guided generation. Specifically, we retrieve appropriate layout
templates according to given conditions as references. The references are then
utilized to guide the denoising or flow-based transport process. By retrieving
layouts compatible with the given conditions, we can uncover the potential
information not explicitly provided in the given condition. Such an approach
offers more effective guidance to the model during the generation process, in
contrast to previous models that feed the condition to the model and let the
model infer the unprovided layout attributes directly. Meanwhile, we design a
condition-modulated attention that selectively absorbs retrieval knowledge,
adapting to the difference between retrieved templates and given conditions.
Extensive experiment results show that our method successfully produces
high-quality layouts that meet the given conditions and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单修改有效解决了过度优化和目标对齐问题。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) aligns text-to-image (T2I) generation
models with human preferences using pairwise preference data. Although
substantial resources are expended in collecting and labeling datasets, a
critical aspect is often neglected: \textit{preferences vary across individuals
and should be represented with more granularity.} To address this, we propose
SmPO-Diffusion, a novel method for modeling preference distributions to improve
the DPO objective, along with a numerical upper bound estimation for the
diffusion optimization objective. First, we introduce a smoothed preference
distribution to replace the original binary distribution. We employ a reward
model to simulate human preferences and apply preference likelihood averaging
to improve the DPO loss, such that the loss function approaches zero when
preferences are similar. Furthermore, we utilize an inversion technique to
simulate the trajectory preference distribution of the diffusion model,
enabling more accurate alignment with the optimization objective. Our approach
effectively mitigates issues of excessive optimization and objective
misalignment present in existing methods through straightforward modifications.
Our SmPO-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in preference
evaluation, outperforming baselines across metrics with lower training costs.

Conclusion: ToothForge结合频谱分析和机器学习，适用于牙科及更广泛的医学形状分析，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating
novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets.
By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine
learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in
milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of
the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent
manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples
are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively
eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore,
synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods,
which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private
dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of
the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned
embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in
digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge
facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and
machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it
applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader
medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes
from various clinics is unrealistic. The code is available at

method for creating a dataset designed to improve alignment between predicted
scores and their textual justifications. By iteratively training the model with
Direct Preference Optimization on two distinct datasets and merging them, we
can improve both scoring accuracy and the coherence of generated explanations.

Abstract: Existing semantic SLAM in dynamic environments mainly identify dynamic
regions through object detection or semantic segmentation methods. However, in
certain highly dynamic scenarios, the detection boxes or segmentation masks

efficient GeneA-SLAM2 system that leverages depth variance constraints to
handle dynamic scenes. Our method extracts dynamic pixels via depth variance
and creates precise depth masks to guide the removal of dynamic objects.
Simultaneously, an autoencoder is used to reconstruct keypoints, improving the
genetic resampling keypoint algorithm to obtain more uniformly distributed
keypoints and enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Our system was evaluated
on multiple highly dynamic sequences. The results demonstrate that GeneA-SLAM2
maintains high accuracy in dynamic scenes compared to current methods. Code is

Abstract: Jointly estimating camera poses and mapping scenes from RGBD images is a
fundamental task in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).
State-of-the-art methods employ 3D Gaussians to represent a scene, and render
these Gaussians through splatting for higher efficiency and better rendering.
However, these methods cannot scale up to extremely large scenes, due to the
inefficient tracking and mapping strategies that need to optimize all 3D
Gaussians in the limited GPU memories throughout the training to maintain the
geometry and color consistency to previous RGBD observations. To resolve this
issue, we propose novel tracking and mapping strategies to work with a novel 3D
representation, dubbed view-tied 3D Gaussians, for RGBD SLAM systems. View-tied
3D Gaussians is a kind of simplified Gaussians, which is tied to depth pixels,
without needing to learn locations, rotations, and multi-dimensional variances.
Tying Gaussians to views not only significantly saves storage but also allows
us to employ many more Gaussians to represent local details in the limited GPU
memory. Moreover, our strategies remove the need of maintaining all Gaussians
learnable throughout the training, while improving rendering quality, and
tracking accuracy. We justify the effectiveness of these designs, and report
better performance over the latest methods on the widely used benchmarks in

*Chuanyu Fu,Yuqi Zhang,Kunbin Yao,Guanying Chen,Yuan Xiong,Chuan Huang,Shuguang Cui,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在实时、逼真渲染方面表现优异，但对瞬态物体场景建模不准确。RobustSplat通过延迟高斯增长和尺度级联掩码引导，解决了这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模受瞬态物体影响的场景时存在渲染伪影问题，高斯密度化过程加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出RobustSplat：1）延迟高斯增长策略，优先优化静态场景结构；2）尺度级联掩码引导，从低分辨率到高分辨率逐步优化掩码预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性和有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RobustSplat通过优化策略显著提升了瞬态物体场景的建模准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its
real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by
transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify
that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture,
unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians
that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a
robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed
Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure
before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient
objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask
bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity
supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of
its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses
to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method
outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and
effectiveness of our method. Our project page is

Motivation: 探索自由观看和任务驱动视觉搜索中是否存在共同的注意力表示，以验证是否可以通过共享表示提高效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于Human Attention Transformer (HAT)的神经网络架构，用于测试自由观看和视觉搜索的共享表示假设。

Result: 模型在自由观看训练后，迁移到视觉搜索任务中，性能仅下降3.86%（SemSS指标），计算成本降低92.29%（GFLOPs）和31.23%（参数）。

Conclusion: 自由观看和视觉搜索可以高效共享注意力表示，显著降低计算成本，验证了假设。

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific
settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a
common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question
and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention
transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that
free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation,
allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to
task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the
predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS)
metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths.
This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and
31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Result: 实验表明DTNet在车辆检测中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: DTNet通过动态权重和注意力机制有效提升了车辆检测的适应性。

Abstract: Stable consumer electronic systems can assist traffic better. Good traffic
consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic
algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms
containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data
relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions
is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle
detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network
to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained
detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed
attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to
strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information
for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image
account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location
information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection.
Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle
detection. Code of the proposed DTNet can be obtained at

Abstract: Controllability plays a crucial role in the practical applications of 3D
indoor scene synthesis. Existing works either allow rough language-based
control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or
employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands
considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address
these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables
both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically,
FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or
reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The
user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation
by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion
Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation.
Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad
applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene,
graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly
solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and
controllability in a range of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ONSD与颅内压（ICP）线性相关，但手动测量依赖操作者经验，亟需自动化方法提高准确性和效率。

Method: 使用KCF跟踪算法和SLIC分割算法自动识别最佳帧，结合GMM和KL散度方法测量ONSD。

Result: 与专家手动测量相比，平均误差0.04，均方偏差0.054，组内相关系数0.782，准确性高。

Conclusion: 该方法自动化程度高，准确性接近专家水平，具有临床推广潜力。

Abstract: Objective. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is recognized as a biomarker
of secondary brain injury, with a significant linear correlation observed
between optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and ICP. Frequent monitoring of ONSD
could effectively support dynamic evaluation of ICP. However, ONSD measurement
is heavily reliant on the operator's experience and skill, particularly in
manually selecting the optimal frame from ultrasound sequences and measuring
ONSD. Approach. This paper presents a novel method to automatically identify
the optimal frame from video sequences for ONSD measurement by employing the
Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) tracking algorithm and Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm. The optic nerve sheath is mapped and
measured using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) combined with a
KL-divergence-based method. Results. When compared with the average
measurements of two expert clinicians, the proposed method achieved a mean
error, mean squared deviation, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of
0.04, 0.054, and 0.782, respectively. Significance. The findings suggest that
this method provides highly accurate automated ONSD measurements, showing
potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a
data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision
Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its
transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In
this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain
training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the
generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises
(i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance.
We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that
learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source
dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition.
This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the
loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of
perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the
model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the
transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further
propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation
on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image
tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and
state-of-the-art performance. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets

space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips
covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000

MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action
recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning
in microgravity contexts. We establish baselines using state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: PBR-SR为PBR纹理超分辨率提供了一种高效、高质量的解决方案，适用于艺术设计和AI生成模型。

Abstract: We present PBR-SR, a novel method for physically based rendering (PBR)
texture super resolution (SR). It outputs high-resolution, high-quality PBR
textures from low-resolution (LR) PBR input in a zero-shot manner. PBR-SR
leverages an off-the-shelf super-resolution model trained on natural images,
and iteratively minimizes the deviations between super-resolution priors and
differentiable renderings. These enhancements are then back-projected into the
PBR map space in a differentiable manner to produce refined, high-resolution
textures. To mitigate view inconsistencies and lighting sensitivity, which is
common in view-based super-resolution, our method applies 2D prior constraints
across multi-view renderings, iteratively refining the shared, upscaled
textures. In parallel, we incorporate identity constraints directly in the PBR
texture domain to ensure the upscaled textures remain faithful to the LR input.
PBR-SR operates without any additional training or data requirements, relying
entirely on pretrained image priors. We demonstrate that our approach produces
high-fidelity PBR textures for both artist-designed and AI-generated meshes,
outperforming both direct SR models application and prior texture optimization
methods. Our results show high-quality outputs in both PBR and rendering
evaluations, supporting advanced applications such as relighting.

Motivation: 处理长视频时，高计算需求和视觉数据冗余是主要挑战，METok旨在解决这些问题。

Method: METok通过三个阶段逐步消除冗余视觉令牌：事件感知压缩、分层令牌修剪和解码阶段KV缓存优化。

Result: 实验表明，METok在效率和准确性之间取得平衡，显著减少计算和内存消耗。

Conclusion: METok为视频大语言模型提供了一种高效的推理解决方案，同时保持或提升准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly
enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing
long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the
redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a
training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to
accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively
eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)
event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning
in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and
(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory
consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok
achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically
selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with
METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all
while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.

Conclusion: PGFormer通过金字塔结构有效捕捉长距离依赖关系，为3D人体姿态估计提供了一种轻量高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size
than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.

Conclusion: 抽象提示比位置提示包含更丰富的语义信息，增强了模型的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is highly effective in natural
image segmentation, it requires dependencies on prompts, which limits its
applicability to medical imaging where manual prompts are often unavailable.
Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle
to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM
(HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong
performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous
self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to
vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the
self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework
achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and
skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical
imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen
datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art
methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract
prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared
to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become a critical challenge in Computer Vision and
Artificial Intelligence. Despite significant progress in detection techniques,
generalizing them to open-set scenarios continues to be a persistent
difficulty. Neural networks are often trained on the closed-world assumption,
but with new generative models constantly evolving, it is inevitable to
encounter data generated by models that are not part of the training
distribution. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose two novel
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection approaches. The first approach is trained
to reconstruct the input image, while the second incorporates an attention
mechanism for detecting OODs. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approaches compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Our
method achieves promising results in deepfake detection and ranks among the
top-performing configurations on the benchmark, demonstrating their potential
for robust, adaptable solutions in dynamic, real-world applications.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread
applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics.
Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments
continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections,
low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent
occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific
datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking
Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically
designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences,
totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object
classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset
captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios,
reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated
14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed
substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on
general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models
demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of
domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized
tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking
community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime
scenarios. Dataset and Source Code can be accessed here

language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing
long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs
support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common
limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on
benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization,
especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral
characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we
integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across
regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as
feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the
benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published
datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three
tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and
human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to
fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with
location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks
including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating
the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS
applications.

*Sohyun Lee,Yeho Kwon,Lukas Hoyer,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GaRA的方法，通过轻量级适配器动态调整SAM模型的权重矩阵，显著提升了模型在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高SAM模型在输入退化情况下的鲁棒性，以支持自动驾驶和机器人等高风险应用。

Method: 引入轻量级适配器（GaRA），动态调整权重矩阵的有效秩，实现细粒度和输入感知的鲁棒化。

Result: GaRA-SAM在所有鲁棒分割基准测试中显著优于先前工作，在ACDC数据集上IoU得分提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: GaRA方法在不牺牲SAM泛化能力的前提下，有效提升了模型对输入退化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Improving robustness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to input
degradations is critical for its deployment in high-stakes applications such as
autonomous driving and robotics. Our approach to this challenge prioritizes
three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent
generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware
robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence
to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose
gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into
intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts
the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively
activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module.
This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without
compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM,
significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In
particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC,
a challenging real corrupted image dataset.

*Jonathan Astermark,Anders Heyden,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效匹配总结方案，显著加速了密集匹配下的两视图相对位姿估计，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集匹配虽能提高位姿估计的精度和鲁棒性，但会导致RANSAC中运行时大幅增加。

Method: 采用高效的匹配总结方案，减少匹配数量但保持精度。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上验证，运行时快10-100倍，精度与全密集匹配相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we speed up robust two-view relative pose from dense
correspondences. Previous work has shown that dense matchers can significantly
improve both accuracy and robustness in the resulting pose. However, the large
number of matches comes with a significantly increased runtime during robust
estimation in RANSAC. To avoid this, we propose an efficient match
summarization scheme which provides comparable accuracy to using the full set
of dense matches, while having 10-100x faster runtime. We validate our approach
on standard benchmark datasets together with multiple state-of-the-art dense
matchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在真实、复杂环境中的表现，验证其是否适用于主动探索任务。

Method: 引入FlySearch，一个3D户外逼真环境，设计三种难度场景测试VLMs性能，并分析失败原因。

Result: 现有VLMs在简单任务中表现不佳，与人类差距随任务难度增加而扩大；部分问题可通过微调解决。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂探索任务中存在局限性，需进一步改进；公开了基准测试和代码库。

Abstract: The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information
often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot
tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In
this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor,
photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex
scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe
that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration
tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We
identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through
context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of
them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark,
scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出AnnoGuide基准，旨在通过自动化方法直接从专家定义的标注指南生成数据标注，减少人工标注需求，并以nuScenes数据集为例展示了3D检测性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注是机器学习应用中的关键但繁琐且昂贵的环节，研究如何通过自动化方法直接从标注指南生成标注以减少人工成本。

Method: 采用开源基础模型进行RGB图像中的目标检测与分割，将2D检测投影到3D空间，并通过聚类LiDAR点生成3D立方体标注。

Result: 通过逐步优化关键组件，3D检测mAP从12.1提升至21.9，但问题仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: AnnoGuide是一个开放且具有挑战性的问题，亟需开发基于LiDAR的基础模型。

Abstract: A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions
for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to
manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is
often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for
facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide:
Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated
methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines,
eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the
well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving
research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR
point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include
a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in
LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection
without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make
AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its
challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes
open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2)
projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR
points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid.
Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we
progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance
improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our
results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem,
underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our
code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark

### [216] [MIND: Material Interface Generation from UDFs for Non-Manifold Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938)
*Xuhui Chen,Fei Hou,Wencheng Wang,Hong Qin,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MIND的新算法，直接从无符号距离场（UDF）生成材料界面，支持非流形网格提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从UDF提取网格时存在拓扑缺陷，且无法处理非流形几何。

Method: 通过计算多标记全局场，结合UDF构建材料界面，并使用多标记Marching Cubes算法提取网格。

Result: 实验表明，MIND能鲁棒处理复杂非流形表面，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MIND为从UDF提取非流形网格提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to
their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has
largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images,
extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely
attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed
distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via
Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as
holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of
representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases.
To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold
Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly
from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The
core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the
UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct
regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two
sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field
capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this
multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that
support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes
algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources,
including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial
axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex
non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 解决异构无标签数据集中高效视觉表示学习的挑战，需要跨客户端联合信息特征并解耦领域特定因素。

Method: 采用共享特征适配器和槽注意力模块，设计双分支师生架构，优化适配器以实现跨域学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现优于集中式基线，学习到紧凑且通用的跨域表示。

Conclusion: 联邦槽注意力是分布式概念下可扩展无监督视觉表示学习的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled
datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated
representations require features that are jointly informative across clients
while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce
FORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning
and feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the
core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across
clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention
module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this
adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a
student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,
while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional
counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by
aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple
real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized
baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal
representation that generalizes well across domains. This work highlights
federated slot attention as an effective tool for scalable, unsupervised visual
representation learning from cross-domain data with distributed concepts.

Result: AI在分类任务中表现与医生相当，但在预测未来AMD进展的任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: MARIO挑战赛为AMD监测设定了基准，AI在分类任务中已接近医生水平，但预测任务仍需改进。

Abstract: The MARIO challenge, held at MICCAI 2024, focused on advancing the automated
detection and monitoring of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) through the
analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Designed to evaluate
algorithmic performance in detecting neovascular activity changes within AMD,
the challenge incorporated unique multi-modal datasets. The primary dataset,
sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test
their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this
dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate
population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved
in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution
between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of
future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with
the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the
challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies,
setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and
clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of
this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a
physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of
predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Conclusion: AstroDiff为天文图像恢复提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Photography is the cornerstone of modern astronomical and space research.
However, most astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes suffer
from atmospheric turbulence, resulting in degraded imaging quality. While
multi-frame strategies like lucky imaging can mitigate some effects, they
involve intensive data acquisition and complex manual processing. In this
paper, we propose AstroDiff, a generative restoration method that leverages
both the high-quality generative priors and restoration capabilities of
diffusion models to mitigate atmospheric turbulence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AstroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art learning-based
methods in astronomical image turbulence mitigation, providing higher
perceptual quality and better structural fidelity under severe turbulence
conditions. Our code and additional results are available at

Conclusion: DFBench和MoA-DF为深度伪造检测提供了新工具，展示了多模态模型的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, the realism of AI-generated
images has significantly improved, posing critical challenges for verifying
digital content authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods often depend
on datasets with limited generation models and content diversity that fail to
keep pace with the evolving complexity and increasing realism of the
AI-generated content. Large multimodal models (LMMs), widely adopted in various
vision tasks, have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities, yet their
potential in deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap,
we present \textbf{DFBench}, a large-scale DeepFake Benchmark featuring (i)
broad diversity, including 540,000 images across real, AI-edited, and
AI-generated content, (ii) latest model, the fake images are generated by 12
state-of-the-art generation models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and
evaluating for both the detection accuracy of deepfake detectors and the
evasion capability of generative models. Based on DFBench, we propose
\textbf{MoA-DF}, Mixture of Agents for DeepFake detection, leveraging a
combined probability strategy from multiple LMMs. MoA-DF achieves
state-of-the-art performance, further proving the effectiveness of leveraging
LMMs for deepfake detection. Database and codes are publicly available at

Result: 在CogVideoX1.5等模型中，理论FLOP减少2.09-2.38倍，实际推理速度提升1.58-1.85倍，PSNR保持高值。

Conclusion: vDiT中的结构稀疏性可系统性地用于长视频合成，显著提升效率。

Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video
generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant
inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video
Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns:
diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\%
attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong
layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the
input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity
acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels
that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for
each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search
algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and
head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal
configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same
attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into
state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1),
Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical
FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$,
and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with
PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent
structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video
synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved
significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic
images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying
the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant
potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and
watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme
to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though
challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning
models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable
prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a
prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models,
which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning
model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and
converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on
the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our
method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual
alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate
the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image
synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and
unsupervised segmentation.

Conclusion: LEG-SLAM在实时语义3D SLAM中表现优异，适用于机器人、AR等交互领域。

Abstract: Modern Gaussian Splatting methods have proven highly effective for real-time
photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, integrating semantic
information into this representation remains a significant challenge,
especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM --
a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with
visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature
compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online
dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic
images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene
reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on
ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive
rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data
preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps.
With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and
other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in
real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM. Project page:

Conclusion: ORV通过占用表示实现了仿真数据到逼真机器人视频的高效转换，为下游机器人学习任务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Acquiring real-world robotic simulation data through teleoperation is
notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently, action-driven
generative models have gained widespread adoption in robot learning and
simulation, as they eliminate safety concerns and reduce maintenance efforts.
However, the action sequences used in these methods often result in limited
control precision and poor generalization due to their globally coarse
alignment. To address these limitations, we propose ORV, an Occupancy-centric
Robot Video generation framework, which utilizes 4D semantic occupancy
sequences as a fine-grained representation to provide more accurate semantic
and geometric guidance for video generation. By leveraging occupancy-based
representations, ORV enables seamless translation of simulation data into
photorealistic robot videos, while ensuring high temporal consistency and
precise controllability. Furthermore, our framework supports the simultaneous
generation of multi-view videos of robot gripping operations - an important
capability for downstream robotic learning tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ORV consistently outperforms existing baseline methods
across various datasets and sub-tasks. Demo, Code and Model:

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，支持工具和解剖的精确控制，并能生成罕见手术异常。

Conclusion: SG2VID为手术模拟提供了更真实和可控的生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical simulation plays a pivotal role in training novice surgeons,
accelerating their learning curve and reducing intra-operative errors. However,
conventional simulation tools fall short in providing the necessary
photorealism and the variability of human anatomy. In response, current methods
are shifting towards generative model-based simulators. Yet, these approaches
primarily focus on using increasingly complex conditioning for precise
synthesis while neglecting the fine-grained human control aspect. To address
this gap, we introduce SG2VID, the first diffusion-based video model that
leverages Scene Graphs for both precise video synthesis and fine-grained human
control. We demonstrate SG2VID's capabilities across three public datasets
featuring cataract and cholecystectomy surgery. While SG2VID outperforms
previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, it also enables precise
synthesis, providing accurate control over tool and anatomy's size and
movement, entrance of new tools, as well as the overall scene layout. We
qualitatively motivate how SG2VID can be used for generative augmentation and
present an experiment demonstrating its ability to improve a downstream phase
detection task when the training set is extended with our synthetic videos.
Finally, to showcase SG2VID's ability to retain human control, we interact with
the Scene Graphs to generate new video samples depicting major yet rare
intra-operative irregularities.

Abstract: Human-human interaction generation has garnered significant attention in
motion synthesis due to its vital role in understanding humans as social
beings. However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based
architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and
efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel, efficient human-human
interaction generation method based on the Mamba framework, designed to meet
the demands of effectively capturing long-sequence dependencies while providing
real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal
Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive
mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences.
To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within
individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual
sequences, we develop two key modules: the self-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba
module and the cross-adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient
feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on two interaction datasets with remarkable quality
and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only
improves accuracy but also requires a minimal parameter size of just 66M ,only
36% of InterGen's, while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds,
which is 46% of InterGen's execution time.

Motivation: 解决CNN在视觉扰动和域偏移下的脆弱性，通过模仿生物视觉系统提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出EVNets，结合VOneBlock和SubcorticalBlock，后者基于神经科学模型设计，优化与生物响应对齐。

Result: EVNets在V1对齐、形状偏置和鲁棒性测试中表现优于基准CNN，提升8.5%；结合数据增强后进一步提升7.3%。

Conclusion: EVNets展示了架构改进与数据增强的互补性，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on object recognition achieve
high task performance but continue to exhibit vulnerability under a range of
visual perturbations and out-of-domain images, when compared with biological
vision. Prior work has demonstrated that coupling a standard CNN with a
front-end block (VOneBlock) that mimics the primate primary visual cortex (V1)
can improve overall model robustness. Expanding on this, we introduce Early
Vision Networks (EVNets), a new class of hybrid CNNs that combine the VOneBlock
with a novel SubcorticalBlock, whose architecture draws from computational
models in neuroscience and is parameterized to maximize alignment with
subcortical responses reported across multiple experimental studies. Without
being optimized to do so, the assembly of the SubcorticalBlock with the
VOneBlock improved V1 alignment across most standard V1 benchmarks, and better
modeled extra-classical receptive field phenomena. In addition, EVNets exhibit
stronger emergent shape bias and overperform the base CNN architecture by 8.5%
on an aggregate benchmark of robustness evaluations, including adversarial
perturbations, common corruptions, and domain shifts. Finally, we show that
EVNets can be further improved when paired with a state-of-the-art data
augmentation technique, surpassing the performance of the isolated data
augmentation approach by 7.3% on our robustness benchmark. This result reveals
complementary benefits between changes in architecture to better mimic biology
and training-based machine learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比语言-图像预训练方法无法原生处理多模态输入，需额外模块融合特征，限制了性能。

Method: 利用离散图像标记器，设计单一Transformer模型处理扩展的文本和图像标记词汇，实现早期融合。

Result: FuseLIP在多模态任务（如VQA和文本引导图像转换检索）中表现优异，单模态任务与基线相当。

Conclusion: FuseLIP通过早期融合实现了更丰富的多模态表示，为多模态嵌入任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image
pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While
this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it
cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a
single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional
modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work,
we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding.
Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a
single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and
image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to
interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared
to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and
evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show
that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as
VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to
baselines on unimodal tasks.

Conclusion: EgoVLM通过生成推理痕迹提高了可解释性，适用于下游应用，并提出了一种新颖的关键帧奖励机制。

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous
agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video
streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to
integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric
video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with
human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly
tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought
(CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering
benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves
performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on
non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by
14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By
explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability,
making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide
reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising
avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Conclusion: DyTact为非侵入式动态接触捕捉提供了高效且高精度的解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic hand-object contacts is essential for realistic
manipulation in AI character animation, XR, and robotics, yet it remains
challenging due to heavy occlusions, complex surface details, and limitations
in existing capture techniques. In this paper, we introduce DyTact, a
markerless capture method for accurately capturing dynamic contact in
hand-object manipulations in a non-intrusive manner. Our approach leverages a
dynamic, articulated representation based on 2D Gaussian surfels to model
complex manipulations. By binding these surfels to MANO meshes, DyTact
harnesses the inductive bias of template models to stabilize and accelerate
optimization. A refinement module addresses time-dependent high-frequency
deformations, while a contact-guided adaptive sampling strategy selectively
increases surfel density in contact regions to handle heavy occlusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyTact not only achieves
state-of-the-art dynamic contact estimation accuracy but also significantly
improves novel view synthesis quality, all while operating with fast
optimization and efficient memory usage. Project Page:

Conclusion: 图像标记连续性的破坏有助于提升ViT在跨域小样本学习中的表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its
large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when
applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data,
which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired
by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting
phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image
tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads
to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a
marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of
image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In
this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find
continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to
transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies
that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme
domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet
effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens,
encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain
gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works. Codes and models are available

Abstract: Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is
crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate
change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes
across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training
specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these
learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate,
the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image
segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for
individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model
on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot
transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts.
Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization
capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods
trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained
models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP）通过大规模无监督预训练表现出色，但可能从噪声数据中继承有害知识，影响可靠性。现有遗忘方法无法精细处理特定知识遗忘。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）遗忘阶段微调需遗忘样本；2）提醒阶段恢复保留样本性能；3）恢复阶段通过模型汤恢复零样本能力。引入知识蒸馏处理分布差异。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了精细知识遗忘问题，提升了模型可靠性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot
performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised
pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from
noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world
applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to
pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire
classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we
address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of
knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving
the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that
progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It
consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be
forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples,
and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model
souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the
distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen
pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style
datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups
while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar
subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning
methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.

Abstract: Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to
generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence
of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results
for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the
synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe
Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human
guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric
Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for
interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel
SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent
conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues
with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset
annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that
PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS.
Comprehensive ablations demonstrate that our PoseFuse3D model improves
interpolation fidelity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双专家一致性模型（DCM），通过语义专家和细节专家的分工，解决了视频扩散模型蒸馏中的时间一致性和细节退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用一致性模型到视频扩散模型会导致时间一致性和外观细节的严重退化，原因是蒸馏过程中存在优化梯度和损失贡献的显著差异。

Method: 提出DCM模型，包含语义专家和细节专家，分别学习语义布局与运动、精细细节优化，并引入时间相干损失和GAN/特征匹配损失。

Result: DCM在显著减少采样步骤的同时，实现了最先进的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 专家分工在视频扩散模型蒸馏中有效，DCM为高效高质量视频合成提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but
require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational
overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating
diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models
often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance
details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency
Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation
process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and
loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the
distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised
temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we
propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)},
where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a
detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce
Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert
and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the
detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with
significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert
specialization in video diffusion model distillation. Our code and models are

TL;DR: AnimeShooter是一个参考引导的多镜头动画数据集，填补了现有数据集在角色一致性和叙事脚本上的空白，并通过自动化流程提供分层注释和视觉一致性。AnimeShooterGen利用多模态大语言模型和视频扩散模型，展示了数据集在生成连贯动画视频中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集缺乏角色参考图像和叙事脚本，无法满足生成连贯多镜头动画的需求。AnimeShooter旨在填补这一空白，提供参考引导的数据集。

Method: 通过自动化流程构建AnimeShooter数据集，包含故事级和镜头级注释。AnimeShooterGen结合多模态大语言模型和视频扩散模型，利用参考图像和上下文生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于AnimeShooter训练的模型在跨镜头视觉一致性和参考视觉引导方面表现优异。

Conclusion: AnimeShooter为连贯动画视频生成提供了有价值的资源，AnimeShooterGen展示了其在多镜头视频生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated
animation production. To produce engaging animations, it is essential to
generate coherent multi-shot video clips with narrative scripts and character
references. However, existing public datasets primarily focus on real-world
scenarios with global descriptions, and lack reference images for consistent
character guidance. To bridge this gap, we present AnimeShooter, a
reference-guided multi-shot animation dataset. AnimeShooter features
comprehensive hierarchical annotations and strong visual consistency across
shots through an automated pipeline. Story-level annotations provide an
overview of the narrative, including the storyline, key scenes, and main
character profiles with reference images, while shot-level annotations
decompose the story into consecutive shots, each annotated with scene,
characters, and both narrative and descriptive visual captions. Additionally, a
dedicated subset, AnimeShooter-audio, offers synchronized audio tracks for each
shot, along with audio descriptions and sound sources. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of AnimeShooter and establish a baseline for the reference-guided
multi-shot video generation task, we introduce AnimeShooterGen, which leverages
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video diffusion models. The
reference image and previously generated shots are first processed by MLLM to
produce representations aware of both reference and context, which are then
used as the condition for the diffusion model to decode the subsequent shot.
Experimental results show that the model trained on AnimeShooter achieves
superior cross-shot visual consistency and adherence to reference visual
guidance, which highlight the value of our dataset for coherent animated video
generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种原生分辨率图像合成方法，突破了传统固定分辨率方法的限制，通过Native-resolution diffusion Transformer（NiT）实现任意分辨率和宽高比的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定分辨率的图像生成方法无法处理多样化的分辨率和宽高比，限制了生成模型的灵活性。

Method: 提出了NiT架构，通过建模变长视觉标记，直接在去噪过程中处理不同分辨率和宽高比。

Result: NiT在ImageNet-256x256和512x512基准测试中达到最优性能，并展示了出色的零样本泛化能力，能生成未见高分辨率和多样宽高比的图像。

Conclusion: 原生分辨率建模有望成为视觉生成模型与先进大语言模型方法之间的桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling
paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and
aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional
fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length
visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we
introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture
designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its
denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns
intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of
resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512
benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in
advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates
excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates
high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536)
and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These
findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a
bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基础空间关系理解上表现有限，缺乏对复杂空间推理的评估。

Method: 通过互联网数据爬取和人工标注构建OmniSpatial基准，包含动态推理、复杂空间逻辑等四大类。

Result: 实验表明现有模型在全面空间理解上表现不足。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major
bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research
has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial
relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object
counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial
reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology.
OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial
logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained
subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we
construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both
open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial
understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial
understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential
directions for future research.

Method: SVGenius基于24个应用领域的真实数据，通过8个任务类别和18个指标评估模型，涵盖不同规模、架构和训练范式的22个模型。

Result: 专有模型显著优于开源模型，但所有模型随复杂性增加性能下降；推理增强训练比单纯扩展更有效，风格迁移仍是最大挑战。

Conclusion: SVGenius为SVG处理提供了首个系统评估框架，为开发更强大的矢量图形模型和自动化图形设计应用提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising
capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited
real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented
evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding,
editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains
with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8
task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning
different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels.
Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform
open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation
with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current
approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than
pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains
the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes
the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial
insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing
automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和模型在复杂多条件检索场景中表现不足，无法充分利用视觉信息。

Method: 提出MERIT数据集和Coral框架，结合嵌入重建和对比学习优化预训练模型。

Result: Coral在MERIT上性能提升45.9%，并在多个基准测试中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文为多条件语义检索研究奠定了基础，贡献包括数据集、问题识别和新框架。

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains
underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single
languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to
fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by
maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However,
practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition
queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first
multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval,
comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7
distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing
models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while
neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose
Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by
integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional
elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.
Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement
over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities
validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our
contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in
existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a
foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic
retrieval.

Conclusion: CamCloneMaster提供了一种更直观、高效的相机控制解决方案。

Abstract: Camera control is crucial for generating expressive and cinematic videos.
Existing methods rely on explicit sequences of camera parameters as control
conditions, which can be cumbersome for users to construct, particularly for
intricate camera movements. To provide a more intuitive camera control method,
we propose CamCloneMaster, a framework that enables users to replicate camera
movements from reference videos without requiring camera parameters or
test-time fine-tuning. CamCloneMaster seamlessly supports reference-based
camera control for both Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video tasks within a
unified framework. Furthermore, we present the Camera Clone Dataset, a
large-scale synthetic dataset designed for camera clone learning, encompassing
diverse scenes, subjects, and camera movements. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that CamCloneMaster outperforms existing methods in terms
of both camera controllability and visual quality.

Motivation: 现有统一模型在视觉语言理解和文本生成图像方面表现优异，但在图像感知和操作任务上受限，而用户对此需求迫切。GPT-4o-Image的发布激发了研究兴趣，作者从中推断其使用了语义编码器而非VAE，从而提出新框架。

Method: 提出UniWorld框架，利用视觉语言模型和对比语义编码器提供的语义特征，构建统一生成模型。

Result: UniWorld仅用1%的数据量就超越了BAGEL在图像编辑任务上的表现，同时在图像理解和生成任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: UniWorld是一个高效且强大的统一框架，适用于图像感知和操作任务，并已开源模型、数据和代码。

Abstract: Although existing unified models deliver strong performance on
vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, their models are
limited in exploring image perception and manipulation tasks, which are
urgently desired by users for wide applications. Recently, OpenAI released
their powerful GPT-4o-Image model for comprehensive image perception and
manipulation, achieving expressive capability and attracting community
interests. By observing the performance of GPT-4o-Image in our carefully
constructed experiments, we infer that GPT-4o-Image leverages features
extracted by semantic encoders instead of VAE, while VAEs are considered
essential components in many image manipulation models. Motivated by such
inspiring observations, we present a unified generative framework named
UniWorld based on semantic features provided by powerful visual-language models
and contrastive semantic encoders. As a result, we build a strong unified model
using only 1% amount of BAGEL's data, which consistently outperforms BAGEL on
image editing benchmarks. UniWorld also maintains competitive image
understanding and generation capabilities, achieving strong performance across
multiple image perception tasks. We fully open-source our models, including
model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在生成长视频时因历史上下文利用不足而难以保持场景一致性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来利用历史信息。

Method: 提出Context-as-Memory方法，包括直接存储上下文帧和通过帧维度拼接预测帧的设计，并引入Memory Retrieval模块基于FOV重叠选择相关帧以减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长视频生成中表现出卓越的记忆能力，优于现有技术，并能泛化到未见过的开放域场景。

Conclusion: Context-as-Memory通过高效利用历史上下文，显著提升了长视频生成的场景一致性和计算效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generation have shown promising results,
yet existing approaches struggle with scene-consistent memory capabilities in
long video generation due to limited use of historical context. In this work,
we propose Context-as-Memory, which utilizes historical context as memory for
video generation. It includes two simple yet effective designs: (1) storing
context in frame format without additional post-processing; (2) conditioning by
concatenating context and frames to be predicted along the frame dimension at
the input, requiring no external control modules. Furthermore, considering the
enormous computational overhead of incorporating all historical context, we
propose the Memory Retrieval module to select truly relevant context frames by
determining FOV (Field of View) overlap between camera poses, which
significantly reduces the number of candidate frames without substantial
information loss. Experiments demonstrate that Context-as-Memory achieves
superior memory capabilities in interactive long video generation compared to
SOTAs, even generalizing effectively to open-domain scenarios not seen during
training. The link of our project page is https://context-as-memory.github.io/.

Motivation: 解决不同视觉模态（如RGB与深度图）间像素对应问题，无需显式光一致性假设。

Method: 扩展对比随机游走框架，同时学习跨模态和模态内匹配的循环一致特征表示。

Result: 在几何和语义对应任务中表现优异，如RGB-深度、RGB-热成像匹配及照片-素描对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于无标签数据，无需对齐多模态图像对。

Abstract: We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given
two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth
map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical
points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random
walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations
for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple
and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely
using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal
image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic
correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks
such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic
matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our
method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在控制场景光照和视觉外观时缺乏几何线索的问题。

Method: 结合HDR视频、合成重光照帧和3D点轨迹，在统一扩散架构中整合光照、外观和几何信息。

Result: 生成的视频在时间一致性和用户提示对齐方面优于现有可控视频生成方法。

Conclusion: IllumiCraft通过多线索整合，显著提升了视频生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution
video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of
geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across
frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end
diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1)
high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2)
synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally
paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues;
and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By
integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified
diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos
aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and
text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing
controllable video generation methods. Project Page:

Method: 通过众包研究，204名日本参与者评估了三种ChatGPT声音和七种自我指称。

Result: 声音显著影响性别化感知，某些自我指称能通过中立性和模糊性避免性别化。年龄和正式度与性别化感知交叉影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了代理身份感知的复杂性，支持交叉性和文化敏感性在语音代理研究中的应用。

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the
ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics
have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents.
Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit
complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of
other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially
expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese
participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and
Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering
alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering,
i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age
and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories,
especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent
identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work
on voice agents.

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，生成的图像不仅符合用户历史偏好，还与其潜在兴趣相关。

Conclusion: 新方法有效扩展了推荐系统的能力，能够直接生成个性化内容。

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents,
recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized
results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to
filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts,
limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities and
achieved significant breakthroughs across various domains, leading to their
widespread adoption in recent years. Building on this progress, we investigate
their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we
establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance
of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services.
To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model
fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a
relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much
larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability.
This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying
LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible
for local life applications.

TL;DR: 该论文针对图像生成模型遗忘（IGMU）任务中的问题，提出了CatIGMU任务分类框架、EvalIGMU评估框架和DataIGM数据集，以解决现有算法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成模型的广泛应用，数据隐私和内容安全成为重要问题，而现有IGMU任务存在任务区分不明确、评估框架不完善等问题。

Method: 设计了CatIGMU任务分类框架、EvalIGMU评估框架，并构建了DataIGM数据集，用于评估和改进IGMU算法。

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data
privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great
attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning
(MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these
challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU)
still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and
unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and
unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning
mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform
exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and
evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in
IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to
facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and
reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel
hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation
guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the
construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation
framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical
aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can
be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for
judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With
EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot
handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially
for preservation and robustness. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文通过信息论视角研究大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理机制，发现中间表示与正确答案间的互信息（MI）峰值现象，并证明MI峰值与模型预测错误率降低相关。提出利用‘思考标记’（如‘Hmm’、‘Wait’）改进LRM推理性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LRMs的内部推理机制，探索其推理过程中的信息动态变化。

Method: 通过跟踪中间表示与正确答案间的互信息（MI）变化，分析MI峰值现象及其与预测错误率的关系，并利用‘思考标记’改进推理性能。

Result: 发现MI峰值现象与预测错误率降低相关，‘思考标记’对推理性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs的推理机制，并提出通过‘思考标记’提升推理性能的实用方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs
from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information
(MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during
LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at
specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during
LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that
as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases.
Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or
transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the
thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for
LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building
on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's
reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,
our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and
offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities. The code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多代理反射方法，用于生成法律合规的论据，显著减少了幻觉和未基于事实的论据，并提高了事实利用率和适时放弃无效论据的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律论据生成中存在幻觉、未基于事实的论据以及无法有效利用事实或适时放弃无效论据的问题，需要一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 采用多代理反射方法，包括一个事实分析代理和一个论据优化代理，通过迭代优化生成三阶段法律论据（原告、被告、反驳）。

Result: 在多代理反射方法下，模型在无效论据放弃、幻觉准确性提升和事实利用率方面显著优于单代理和非反射多代理基线。

Conclusion: 多代理反射框架为法律论据生成提供了一种可靠的计算方法，有助于构建可信赖的AI法律系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument
generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through
hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided
factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper
introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these
challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs
specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative
refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant,
rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent,
enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using
four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e,
Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched",
and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant
superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments
cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing
fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable"
scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of
provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within
a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical
persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation
systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级视觉语言模型，用于隐私保护和资源高效的计算机使用代理（CUA），通过本地运行和自动数据筛选框架实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CUA依赖云推理，存在隐私和可扩展性问题，需开发本地运行的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 采用LLM-as-Judge框架自动评估和筛选合成交互轨迹，生成高质量强化学习数据，训练本地视觉语言模型。

Result: 在OS-World基准测试中，本地微调模型优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私、高效且通用的GUI代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant
progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these
agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute
demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when
operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward
privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight
vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this
compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically
evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing
high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation.
Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local
model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward
private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

*Kalyan Nakka,Nitesh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BitBypass的新型黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过利用连字符分隔的比特流伪装来绕过大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）可能生成有害内容，现有技术（如监督微调、人类反馈强化学习等）试图确保其安全性，但这些方法仍易受对抗性攻击。

Method: 提出BitBypass攻击，利用比特流伪装而非传统的提示工程或对抗性操作，绕过LLMs的安全对齐。

Result: 在五种先进LLMs（如GPT-4o、Gemini 1.5等）上测试，BitBypass成功绕过安全对齐并生成有害内容，且在隐蔽性和成功率上优于其他攻击方法。

Conclusion: BitBypass展示了在越狱LLMs方面的有效性和高效性，揭示了现有安全对齐的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: The inherent risk of generating harmful and unsafe content by Large Language
Models (LLMs), has highlighted the need for their safety alignment. Various
techniques like supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human
feedback, and red-teaming were developed for ensuring the safety alignment of
LLMs. However, the robustness of these aligned LLMs is always challenged by
adversarial attacks that exploit unexplored and underlying vulnerabilities of
the safety alignment. In this paper, we develop a novel black-box jailbreak
attack, called BitBypass, that leverages hyphen-separated bitstream camouflage
for jailbreaking aligned LLMs. This represents a new direction in jailbreaking
by exploiting fundamental information representation of data as continuous
bits, rather than leveraging prompt engineering or adversarial manipulations.
Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude
3.5, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral, in adversarial perspective, revealed the
capabilities of BitBypass in bypassing their safety alignment and tricking them
into generating harmful and unsafe content. Further, we observed that BitBypass
outperforms several state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks in terms of stealthiness
and attack success. Overall, these results highlights the effectiveness and
efficiency of BitBypass in jailbreaking these state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: 实验证明系统能有效提升测试覆盖率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合图结构和LLMs，推动了Web应用测试技术的发展。

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring
their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature
of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling
dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an
automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web
application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the
system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and
generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle
conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions
include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site
navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating
form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating
form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of
web application testing.

better align with AI's dynamic and exploratory nature. We aim to enhance
project management practices for AI software projects by bridging these gaps.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C2E的自监督学习框架，利用Kolmogorov复杂性从手术视频中学习紧凑且信息丰富的表示，无需标注数据即可提升编码器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频理解在微创手术（MIS）中至关重要，但监督学习需要大量标注数据，而医学领域的数据标注成本高昂且稀缺。现有的自监督方法难以捕捉结构和物理信息，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出Compress-to-Explore（C2E）框架，通过熵最大化解码器压缩图像，同时保留临床相关细节，从而学习紧凑且信息丰富的表示。

Result: C2E在多种手术ML任务（如工作流分类、工具-组织交互分类、分割和诊断）中表现出强大的泛化能力，并作为手术视觉基础模型提升了性能。

Conclusion: C2E展示了自监督学习在提升手术AI性能和改善MIS结果方面的潜力，其紧凑表示能更好地解耦图像不同结构部分的特征。

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally
invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large,
annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are
prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can
address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture
structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We
propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that
leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations
from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images
while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance
without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E
demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such
as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification,
segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical
visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal
compact representation better disentangles features from different structural
parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet
untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and
improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: Previous works in the literature apply 3D spatial-only models on 4D
functional MRI data leading to possible sub-par feature extraction to be used
for downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we aim to develop a
novel 4D convolution network to extract 4D joint temporal-spatial kernels that
not only learn spatial information but in addition also capture temporal

spatial-temporal data in functional MRI compared to 3D models. The 4D CNN model
improves Alzheimers disease diagnosis for rs-fMRI data, enabling earlier

TL;DR: 提出了一套新的解剖感知评估指标和CARE框架，显著提升了稀疏视图CT重建中关键解剖结构的完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如SSIM和PSNR）未能充分捕捉关键解剖结构的完整性，尤其是小或薄区域。

Method: 提出解剖感知评估指标和CARE框架，通过结构惩罚在训练中增强解剖结构的保留。

Result: CARE显著提升了重建的完整性，大器官提升32%，小器官22%，肠道40%，血管36%。

Conclusion: CARE框架有效解决了稀疏视图CT重建中解剖结构完整性的问题，且模型无关。

Abstract: Widely adopted evaluation metrics for sparse-view CT reconstruction--such as
Structural Similarity Index Measure and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio--prioritize
pixel-wise fidelity but often fail to capture the completeness of critical
anatomical structures, particularly small or thin regions that are easily
missed. To address this limitation, we propose a suite of novel anatomy-aware
evaluation metrics designed to assess structural completeness across anatomical
structures, including large organs, small organs, intestines, and vessels.
Building on these metrics, we introduce CARE, a Completeness-Aware
Reconstruction Enhancement framework that incorporates structural penalties
during training to encourage anatomical preservation of significant structures.
CARE is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into analytical,
implicit, and generative methods. When applied to these methods, CARE
substantially improves structural completeness in CT reconstructions, achieving
up to +32% improvement for large organs, +22% for small organs, +40% for
intestines, and +36% for vessels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜血管分割对诊断眼部和心血管疾病至关重要，但现有方法如U-Net仍面临训练数据不足、数据分布不平衡和特征提取不足的挑战，影响了分割效果和模型泛化能力。

Method: DEFFA-Unet引入额外编码器处理领域不变输入，开发特征过滤融合模块和注意力引导的特征重建模块，并提出创新的数据增强和平衡方法。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，DEFFA-Unet在分割性能和模型泛化能力上均优于基线模型和现有先进方法，尤其在交叉验证中表现突出。

Conclusion: DEFFA-Unet通过改进特征提取和数据增强方法，显著提升了视网膜血管分割的精度和模型泛化能力，为相关疾病的诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Retinal blood vessel segmentation is crucial for diagnosing ocular and
cardiovascular diseases. Although the introduction of U-Net in 2015 by Olaf
Ronneberger significantly advanced this field, yet issues like limited training
data, imbalance data distribution, and inadequate feature extraction persist,
hindering both the segmentation performance and optimal model generalization.
Addressing these critical issues, the DEFFA-Unet is proposed featuring an
additional encoder to process domain-invariant pre-processed inputs, thereby
improving both richer feature encoding and enhanced model generalization. A
feature filtering fusion module is developed to ensure the precise feature
filtering and robust hybrid feature fusion. In response to the task-specific
need for higher precision where false positives are very costly, traditional
skip connections are replaced with the attention-guided feature reconstructing
fusion module. Additionally, innovative data augmentation and balancing methods
are proposed to counter data scarcity and distribution imbalance, further
boosting the robustness and generalization of the model. With a comprehensive
suite of evaluation metrics, extensive validations on four benchmark datasets
(DRIVE, CHASEDB1, STARE, and HRF) and an SLO dataset (IOSTAR), demonstrate the
proposed method's superiority over both baseline and state-of-the-art models.
Particularly the proposed method significantly outperforms the compared methods
in cross-validation model generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非凸图总变分（NC-GTV）方法，结合ℓ2范数保真项，形成凸目标函数，避免了局部极小值。通过图Huber函数和Gershgorin圆定理确保凸性，并设计了基于ADMM的高效算法。实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的图像去噪方法使用凸正则化项（如TV），但存在局限性。本文旨在提出一种非凸图总变分方法，确保目标函数凸性，提高去噪效果。

Method: 定义NC-GTV为图Huber函数，通过Gershgorin圆定理确定参数a以保证凸性。设计基于ADMM的线性时间算法，并将其展开为轻量级前馈网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像去噪中优于未展开的GTV和其他代表性方法，且网络参数更少。

Conclusion: NC-GTV方法通过非凸图总变分和高效算法，实现了高性能的图像去噪，同时减少了参数复杂度。

Abstract: Conventional model-based image denoising optimizations employ convex
regularization terms, such as total variation (TV) that convexifies the
$\ell_0$-norm to promote sparse signal representation. Instead, we propose a
new non-convex total variation term in a graph setting (NC-GTV), such that when
combined with an $\ell_2$-norm fidelity term for denoising, leads to a convex
objective with no extraneous local minima. We define NC-GTV using a new graph
variant of the Huber function, interpretable as a Moreau envelope. The crux is
the selection of a parameter $a$ characterizing the graph Huber function that
ensures overall objective convexity; we efficiently compute $a$ via an
adaptation of Gershgorin Circle Theorem (GCT). To minimize the convex
objective, we design a linear-time algorithm based on Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and unroll it into a lightweight feed-forward
network for data-driven parameter learning. Experiments show that our method
outperforms unrolled GTV and other representative image denoising schemes,
while employing far fewer network parameters.

Motivation: 临床实践中常遇到脑MRI模态缺失的问题，需要一种有效的方法合成缺失模态以辅助诊断。

Result: 实验表明，SwinUNETR在图像质量、解剖一致性和诊断价值方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR为脑MRI模态缺失问题提供了高效解决方案，具有重要临床应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in
clinical diagnostics by providing complementary information across different
imaging modalities. However, a common challenge in clinical practice is missing
MRI modalities. In this paper, we apply SwinUNETR to the synthesize of missing
modalities in brain MRI. SwinUNETR is a novel neural network architecture
designed for medical image analysis, integrating the strengths of Swin
Transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Swin Transformer, a
variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT), incorporates hierarchical feature
extraction and window-based self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture
both local and global contextual information effectively. By combining the Swin
Transformer with CNNs, SwinUNETR merges global context awareness with detailed
spatial resolution. This hybrid approach addresses the challenges posed by the
varying modality characteristics and complex brain structures, facilitating the
generation of accurate and realistic synthetic images. We evaluate the
performance of SwinUNETR on brain MRI datasets and demonstrate its superior
capability in generating clinically valuable images. Our results show
significant improvements in image quality, anatomical consistency, and
diagnostic value.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感地理制图依赖代表性样本数据，但地表动态变化快，样本易过时，人工更新成本高。

Method: 提出TasGen框架，通过时间-光谱嵌入建模时序遥感影像的依赖关系，自动生成动态样本。

Result: 无需额外人工标注，即可捕捉地表变化。

Conclusion: TasGen为动态样本生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping depends heavily on representative
and timely sample data. However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics
necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples
obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates.
In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation
using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a
two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples,
designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in
time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing
land surface changes without additional manual annotations.

Result: 实验验证了TSRNet在恢复高质量图像方面的优越性。

Conclusion: TSRNet通过树架构和跨域信息提取，显著提升了图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can extract more accurate structural
information via deep architectures to obtain good performance in image
super-resolution. However, it is not easy to find effect of important layers in
a single network architecture to decrease performance of super-resolution. In
this paper, we design a tree-guided CNN for image super-resolution (TSRNet). It
uses a tree architecture to guide a deep network to enhance effect of key nodes
to amplify the relation of hierarchical information for improving the ability
of recovering images. To prevent insufficiency of the obtained structural
information, cosine transform techniques in the TSRNet are used to extract
cross-domain information to improve the performance of image super-resolution.
Adaptive Nesterov momentum optimizer (Adan) is applied to optimize parameters
to boost effectiveness of training a super-resolution model. Extended
experiments can verify superiority of the proposed TSRNet for restoring
high-quality images. Its code can be obtained at

*Andrew Kiruluta,Preethi Raju,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新型非注意力架构的大语言模型，高效处理超长上下文窗口，避免传统Transformer的二次方复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer因自注意力机制导致内存和计算开销过大，难以处理超长上下文。

Method: 结合状态空间块（S4启发）、多分辨率卷积层、轻量级循环监督器和检索增强外部记忆，避免token间注意力。

Result: 模型能高效处理数十万至数百万token的上下文，计算复杂度接近线性。

Conclusion: 非注意力架构为处理超长上下文提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel non attention based architecture for large language models
(LLMs) that efficiently handles very long context windows, on the order of
hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens. Unlike traditional
Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation
overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids
token to token attention entirely. Instead, it combines the following
complementary components: State Space blocks (inspired by S4) that learn
continuous time convolution kernels and scale near linearly with sequence
length, Multi Resolution Convolution layers that capture local context at
different dilation levels, a lightweight Recurrent Supervisor to maintain a
global hidden state across sequential chunks, and Retrieval Augmented External
Memory that stores and retrieves high-level chunk embeddings without
reintroducing quadratic operations.

TL;DR: 论文研究了量化LLMs中的异常值问题，提出了一种混合方法以减少量化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化可以降低LLMs的服务成本，但激活整数运算时，异常值会增加量化误差。

Method: 通过平滑和旋转变换观察值，提出基于通道幅度的新度量，并采用混合方法（通道缩放+旋转）。

Result: 新方法有效减少了量化误差。

Conclusion: 混合方法在量化LLMs中具有潜力，能显著降低误差。

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling
faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer
arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses
challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization
error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their
effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and
rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include
introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based
on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies
channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation
of its benefits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ODLRI的方法，通过分解权重矩阵为量化和低秩两部分，优化大语言模型的压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合优化方法在量化和低秩近似之间交替优化，但往往牺牲一方效果，导致分解不理想。

Method: 引入Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI)，让低秩部分专门捕捉激活敏感的权重，从而平衡量化和低秩近似。

Result: 实验表明，ODLRI在Llama2、Llama3-8B和Mistral-7B上降低了激活感知误差，减少了量化规模，并提升了低比特设置下的困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: ODLRI通过结构化分解有效平衡了量化和低秩近似，提升了模型压缩效果。

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components
($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used
technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint
optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank
approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the
expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to
leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce
Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank
components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This
structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization,
enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank
approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B
demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework
consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and
improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过合成RL数据进一步改进RLVR训练，以提升模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出SynthRL，包括种子问题选择、问题增强和验证三个阶段，确保数据的正确性和难度提升。

Conclusion: SynthRL能有效激发更深层次的推理能力，尤其在最具挑战性的样本上表现突出。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have shown notable progress in scaling test-time
compute effectively. In this work, we investigate how synthesized RL data can
further improve RLVR. To this end, we propose \textbf{SynthRL}-a scalable and
guaranteed pipeline for automatic data scaling in reasoning-oriented RL
training. SynthRL comprises three key stages: (1) selecting seed questions with
appropriate distribution, (2) augmenting them into more challenging variants
while preserving the original answers, and (3) a guaranteed verification stage
that ensures near-perfect correctness and difficulty enhancement. Our empirical
experiments demonstrate SynthRL's scalability and effectiveness. When applied
to the MMK12 dataset, SynthRL synthesizes over 3.3K additional verifiable,
challenging questions from approximately 8K seed samples. Models trained with
our synthesized data achieve consistent gains across five out-of-domain visual
math reasoning benchmarks, with a significant improvement over baseline models
trained on seed data alone. Notably, detailed analysis reveals that the gains
are more pronounced on the most challenging evaluation samples, highlighting
SynthRL's effectiveness in eliciting deeper and more complex reasoning
patterns.

TL;DR: KDRL是一种结合知识蒸馏（KD）和强化学习（RL）的统一后训练框架，旨在提升大语言模型的推理能力，平衡性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，RL样本效率低，KD泛化能力差，需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: KDRL通过策略梯度优化，同时最小化学生与教师模型的RKL散度并最大化基于规则的奖励。

Result: 实验表明，KDRL在多个推理基准上优于GRPO和KD基线，且平衡了性能和效率。

Conclusion: 结合KD和RL是训练推理型大语言模型的有效策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged
two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement
learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence
of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency
when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories.
Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but
tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present
\textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly
optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and
self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient
optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence
(RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the
expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that
integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL
approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the
overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD
baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning
token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as
an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

Motivation: 现有序列建模方法（如Gated DeltaNet、TTT和RWKV-7）通过Delta学习规则改进性能，但存在非线性递归结构的局限性。本文旨在分析这些模型的优缺点，并提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于闭环控制理论，提出Comba模型，采用标量加低秩状态转移，结合状态反馈和输出反馈校正，并实现硬件高效的并行内核。

Result: 在340M/1.3B参数的大规模语料上训练，Comba在语言和视觉建模中表现出优越性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: Comba通过创新的非线性RNN设计和硬件优化，显著提升了序列建模的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and
RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent
memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space
models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models
introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector,
resulting in a nonlinear recursive structure. In this paper, we first introduce
the concept of Nonlinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages
and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we
propose a novel Nonlinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a
scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output
feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise
parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on
large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates its superior performance and computation
efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习中零奖励假设的挑战，即中间令牌生成无即时奖励的问题，为响应级奖励方法提供理论支持。

Method: 引入轨迹策略梯度定理，证明响应级奖励模型可无偏估计策略梯度，并提出新算法TRePO。

Result: 理论表明PPO、GRPO等方法具备建模令牌级奖励信号的能力，TRePO在简化性和内存效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM微调提供了更实用的方法，开发者可专注于改进响应级奖励模型，TRePO具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language
models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e.,
intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward,
while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This
assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are
often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we
provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy
Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown
token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level
reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,
for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals
that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess
the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical
justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way
for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat
training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level
reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of
popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and
practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new
algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically
grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,
and holds promise for broad applicability.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches -
utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in
improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training
recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE,
directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations
for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate
convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical
training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we
show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy
across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding
and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of
future large-scale models.

Method: 将检索文本视为依赖于查询的噪声上下文示例，并推导了泛化界和偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 分析表明，RAG存在固有的泛化误差上限，且框架能够通过引入均匀和非均匀噪声建模训练数据和外部语料库的检索。

Conclusion: 实验验证了ICL和RAG在样本效率上的优势，支持理论分析。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in
recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its
theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose
the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear
regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the
retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the
classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our
analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on
RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model
retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing
uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample
efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks,
such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing
and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the
classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of
training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or
unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading
to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used
in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of
diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored
in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory
retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong
memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction
around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the
critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where
an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new
attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples.
Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to
emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the
same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings
provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in
diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of
spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used
diffusion models.

Conclusion: 为AI抽象推理能力提供了创新方法。

Abstract: This paper thoroughly investigates the challenges of enhancing AI's abstract
reasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) tasks involving complex human-like concepts. Firstly, it dissects the
empirical reality that traditional end-to-end RPM-solving models heavily rely
on option pool configurations, highlighting that this dependency constrains the
model's reasoning capabilities. To address this limitation, the paper proposes
the Johnny architecture - a novel representation space-based framework for
RPM-solving. Through the synergistic operation of its Representation Extraction
Module and Reasoning Module, Johnny significantly enhances reasoning
performance by supplementing primitive negative option configurations with a
learned representation space. Furthermore, to strengthen the model's capacity
for capturing positional relationships among local features, the paper
introduces the Spin-Transformer network architecture, accompanied by a
lightweight Straw Spin-Transformer variant that reduces computational overhead
through parameter sharing and attention mechanism optimization. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that both Johnny and Spin-Transformer achieve superior
performance on RPM tasks, offering innovative methodologies for advancing AI's
abstract reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 动态权重生成和上下文切换能力有助于提升持续学习的性能。

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of
human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general
intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards
achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context
switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic
forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned
task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task
contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the
interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper
introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context
switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an
additional network that generates the weights of the primary network
dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is
input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer
vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of
previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,
Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient
Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding
dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in
enabling continual learning for improved performance.

Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感应用中取得进展，但参与者提供的标注数据可能存在复杂标签噪声，影响模型性能，需要优化策略减轻噪声客户端的不良影响。

Method: MaskedOptim框架分为两阶段：第一阶段检测高噪声率客户端，第二阶段通过端到端标签校正机制修正噪声数据标签，并使用几何中值模型聚合增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个图像数据集和一个文本数据集上的实验表明，该框架在不同场景下表现鲁棒，且标签校正机制显著提升了噪声客户端本地数据集的质量。

Conclusion: MaskedOptim框架有效解决了联邦学习中的标签噪声问题，提升了模型性能和数据质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in
privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL
participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding
annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying
levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of
the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely
attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an
effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy
clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework,
MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is
designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise
rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients'
data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the
negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by
learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via
backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the
geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla
averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct
evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label
noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results
indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different
scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances
the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes
will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are
available via https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim .

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的机器遗忘方法PUBG，旨在解决现有方法在遗忘后可能导致退化、幻觉或过度拒绝回答的问题，同时确保生成隐私保护且信息丰富的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法在大型视觉语言模型中可能导致遗忘后行为异常（如退化或幻觉），因此需要一种既能保护隐私又能保持响应质量和信息量的新方法。

Method: 提出了PUBG方法，通过明确引导遗忘后的行为朝向理想的输出分布，确保生成视觉基础和信息丰富的响应。

Result: 实验表明，PUBG能有效避免遗忘后遗症，生成既隐私保护又信息丰富的响应，而现有方法则无法兼顾。

Conclusion: PUBG为LVLMs提供了一种有效的遗忘方法，解决了隐私保护与响应质量之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data.
However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute
outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable
behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses.
We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider
the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than
relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new
unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving
yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel
unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a
desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods
suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy
violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually
grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肾小球健康分类任务中图构建（节点、边和特征识别）的独特困难，填补GNN在该领域的应用空白。

Method: 采用传统和机器学习结合的计算机视觉技术构建异构图，提出HIEGNet架构整合肾小球和免疫细胞信息。

Result: HIEGNet在肾移植患者全切片图像数据集上表现优于基线模型，泛化能力最佳。

Conclusion: HIEGNet通过整合免疫环境信息，显著提升了肾小球分类性能，为病理学提供了新工具。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in
histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have
not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an
important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties,
particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes,
edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed
of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques
to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a
heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN
architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both
glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to
consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our
HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney
transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms
several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all
baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

*Yuyang Zhou,Ferrante Neri,Yew-Soon Ong,Ruibin Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Siamese网络块的代理模型方法SiamNAS，用于高效多目标神经架构搜索（NAS），显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NAS是多目标的，计算成本高且难以高效解决，需要近似方法。

Method: 使用Siamese网络块预测架构间的支配关系，替代拥挤距离计算，集成到SiamNAS框架中。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-201上，SiamNAS以极低计算成本（0.01 GPU天）找到Pareto最优解，表现优异。

Conclusion: Siamese代理模型在多任务优化中潜力显著，可扩展为生成多样化Pareto解集。

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective,
balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost.
This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to
solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel
surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network
blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures.
Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces
the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a
heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS,
this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process.
Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify
Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The
proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best
architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in
terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study
highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to
generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation
across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for
generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal
solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为交互场匹配（IFM）的新方法，作为静电匹配（EFM）的扩展，解决了EFM中建模复杂静电场的难题，并通过物理启发的强相互作用场实现了更好的数据生成和传输效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFM方法在建模静电场时存在困难，尤其是在处理电容器板外的复杂场时。本文旨在通过引入更通用的交互场来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了交互场匹配（IFM）方法，扩展了EFM的适用范围，并设计了一种基于强相互作用的物理启发式场实现。

Result: 在玩具和图像数据传输问题上展示了IFM的性能。

Conclusion: IFM不仅解决了EFM的局限性，还通过物理启发的设计提升了数据生成和传输的效果。

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel
physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an
electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using
neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into
account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we
propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows
using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore,
inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we
design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems
which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance
on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Result: 通过Frechet距离和标准指标评估，系统在源追踪任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在区分真实与伪造语音及追踪来源方面具有显著优势，为音频源追踪提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced
AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed
speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a
novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss
with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification
network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves
discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance
robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The
Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio
signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding
fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source
tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard
metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline
system.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的音频-视觉鸡尾酒会数据集，用于测试AVSR系统在真实噪声环境中的性能，并显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVSR模型在理想化场景中表现良好，但忽略了现实世界中的复杂情况（如说话和沉默面部片段），因此需要改进。

Method: 引入了一个包含说话和沉默面部片段的1526小时AVSR数据集，并在极端噪声环境中测试性能。

Result: 相对于现有技术，词错误率降低了67%，从119%降至39.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法在极端噪声环境中显著提升了AVSR性能，无需依赖显式分割线索。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) offers a robust solution for speech
recognition in challenging environments, such as cocktail-party scenarios,
where relying solely on audio proves insufficient. However, current AVSR models
are often optimized for idealized scenarios with consistently active speakers,
overlooking the complexities of real-world settings that include both speaking
and silent facial segments. This study addresses this gap by introducing a
novel audio-visual cocktail-party dataset designed to benchmark current AVSR
systems and highlight the limitations of prior approaches in realistic noisy
conditions. Additionally, we contribute a 1526-hour AVSR dataset comprising
both talking-face and silent-face segments, enabling significant performance
gains in cocktail-party environments. Our approach reduces WER by 67% relative
to the state-of-the-art, reducing WER from 119% to 39.2% in extreme noise,
without relying on explicit segmentation cues.

Abstract: This paper addresses source tracing in synthetic speech-identifying
generative systems behind manipulated audio via speaker recognition-inspired
pipelines. While prior work focuses on spoofing detection, source tracing lacks
robust solutions. We evaluate two approaches: classification-based and
metric-learning. We tested our methods on the MLAADv5 benchmark using ResNet
and self-supervised learning (SSL) backbones. The results show that ResNet
achieves competitive performance with the metric learning approach, matching
and even exceeding SSL-based systems. Our work demonstrates ResNet's viability
for source tracing while underscoring the need to optimize SSL representations
for this task. Our work bridges speaker recognition methodologies with audio

Motivation: 现有方法（如运动图和扩散模型）在长期连贯性和音乐对齐方面存在不足，需新方法提升生成质量。

Method: 1. 跨模态对比学习对齐音乐与舞蹈表征；2. 优化运动图系统实现高效检索与拼接；3. 多条件扩散模型结合音乐信号与对比特征。

Result: 实验证明MotionRAG-Diff在运动质量、多样性和音乐同步性上达到最优。

Conclusion: MotionRAG-Diff为音乐驱动舞蹈生成提供了新范式，结合检索的模板保真与扩散的创造力。

Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance
sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing
approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed
template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while
capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical
alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a
hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance
generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three
core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that
aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space,
establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An
optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless
concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence
across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly
conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion
quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality,
diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a
new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based
template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.

TL;DR: StarVC是一种自回归语音转换框架，通过先预测文本标记再合成声学特征，显著提升了语音转换的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换方法直接提取说话者信息而忽略语义内容的显式利用，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出StarVC框架，先预测文本标记再合成声学特征，结合显式文本建模。

Result: 实验表明，StarVC在保留语言内容（WER、CER）和说话者特征（SECS、MOS）方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: StarVC通过显式文本建模有效提升了语音转换的性能。

Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while
preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker
information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of
linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker
identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could
enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate
semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the
integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified
autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing
acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms
conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and
CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that
reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling
6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However,
developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their
rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is
currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world
scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available
6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve
diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using
the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each
rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the
twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene
tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also
release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay
functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion,
and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools
provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction,
adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The

Method: 使用GPT-2小模型，测试人类语音、鲸鱼叫声、鸟类鸣叫和白噪声的输入，定义SIP评分评估反应。

Result: 鲸鱼和鸟类声音的SIP评分高于白噪声，人类语音反应中等，表明模型能检测无语义数据的潜在结构。

Conclusion: 生成模型的反应性可作为传统SETI方法的补充，帮助识别值得关注的数据。

Abstract: We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can
induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that
extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can
trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from
decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the
input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text,
using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations,
Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All
inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To
assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction
Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and
repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher
SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate
responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even
in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could
complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative
intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify
data worth closer attention.

Abstract: We present SA-Radar (Simulate Any Radar), a radar simulation approach that
enables controllable and efficient generation of radar cubes conditioned on
customizable radar attributes. Unlike prior generative or physics-based
simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized
attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar
attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations
induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need
for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of
range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further
construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly
train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including
2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that
SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently
improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real

This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE)
framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest
Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we
demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental
Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing,
both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles
is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group
dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure
influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting
distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity
of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

Result: 实验表明，FlexPainter在灵活性和生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlexPainter通过多模态引导和一致性优化，为高质量纹理生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the
rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for
texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt
modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore,
inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture
generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter},
a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal
conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A
shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible
aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space,
we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style
information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D
knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images
simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding.
Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module
during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a
3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is
used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.

Result: 数据集支持定量评估物理建模，并为DyNVS模型提供集成管道，促进研究应用。

Conclusion: PhysGaia将推动动态视角合成、物理场景理解和深度学习与物理模拟结合的研究，实现更真实的动态场景重建。

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed
for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects
and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily
focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support
physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic
scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they
realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it
contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas,
viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies
prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated
to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected
material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of
physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information,
including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To
facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines
for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their
results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware
modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view
synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models
integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful
reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and
codes are available in the project website,

Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for dietary monitoring, medical
nutrition management, and food intake analysis. Existing 3D Food Volume
estimation methods accurately compute the food volume but lack for food
portions selection. We present VolTex, a framework that improves \change{the
food object selection} in food volume estimation. Allowing users to specify a
target food item via text input to be segmented, our method enables the precise
selection of specific food objects in real-world scenes. The segmented object
is then reconstructed using the Neural Surface Reconstruction method to
generate high-fidelity 3D meshes for volume computation. Extensive evaluations
on the MetaFood3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
isolating and reconstructing food items for accurate volume estimation. The

Conclusion: HumanRAM为单目或稀疏图像的人体重建与动画提供了高效、高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer
graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated
dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures.
To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward
approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or
sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation
into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized
by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction
models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera
parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a
DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel
viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our
model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and
high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM
significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy,
animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了人机交互的准确性，展示了语音韵律在机器人指令解析中的重要性。

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language
instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional
methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often
discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a
novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve
instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models
via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans.
Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics,
designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves
95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and
determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96%
accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot

Conclusion: 实现了异构机械手的语义抓取转移，将视觉抓取与概率生成建模结合。

Abstract: We propose a new approach to vision-based dexterous grasp translation, which
aims to transfer grasp intent across robotic hands with differing morphologies.
Given a visual observation of a source hand grasping an object, our goal is to
synthesize a functionally equivalent grasp for a target hand without requiring
paired demonstrations or hand-specific simulations. We frame this problem as a
stochastic transport between grasp distributions using the Schr\"odinger Bridge
formalism. Our method learns to map between source and target latent grasp
spaces via score and flow matching, conditioned on visual observations. To
guide this translation, we introduce physics-informed cost functions that
encode alignment in base pose, contact maps, wrench space, and manipulability.
Experiments across diverse hand-object pairs demonstrate our approach generates
stable, physically grounded grasps with strong generalization. This work
enables semantic grasp transfer for heterogeneous manipulators and bridges
vision-based grasping with probabilistic generative modeling.

Conclusion: HiLO方法在真实数据集上表现优异，且具有跨场景的泛化能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the
environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use
feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and
hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles.
High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational
requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this
area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel
transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental
results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$
score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale
real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between
urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural Rodrigues Operator的学习方法，用于增强神经网络对关节系统运动的理解和预测能力，并设计了Rodrigues Network（RodriNet）架构。实验表明，该方法在运动预测和模仿学习等任务中表现优于传统网络。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如MLPs和Transformers）缺乏对关节系统运动结构的归纳偏置，限制了其在动作学习和预测中的表现。

Method: 提出Neural Rodrigues Operator，作为经典前向运动学操作的可学习扩展，并基于此设计了RodriNet架构。

Result: 在运动预测和模仿学习任务中，RodriNet表现显著优于传统网络。

Conclusion: 将结构化运动学先验融入网络架构能有效提升动作学习能力。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting articulated actions is important in robot
learning. However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack
inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated
systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable
generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to
inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on
this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural
architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity
of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction,
showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation
learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image
3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured
kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in
various domains.

Conclusion: 该框架为CDE协调提供了实用解决方案，提升了数据互操作性和选择效率。

Abstract: This research aims to develop a dynamic and scalable framework to facilitate
harmonization of Common Data Elements (CDEs) across heterogeneous biomedical
datasets by addressing challenges such as semantic heterogeneity, structural
variability, and context dependence to streamline integration, enhance
interoperability, and accelerate scientific discovery. Our methodology
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for context-aware text embeddings that
convert CDEs into dense vectors capturing semantic relationships and patterns.
These embeddings are clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to group semantically similar
CDEs. The framework incorporates four key steps: (1) LLM-based text embedding
to mathematically represent semantic context, (2) unsupervised clustering of
embeddings via HDBSCAN, (3) automated labeling using LLM summarization, and (4)
supervised learning to train a classifier assigning new or unclustered CDEs to
labeled clusters. Evaluated on the NIH NLM CDE Repository with over 24,000
CDEs, the system identified 118 meaningful clusters at an optimized minimum
cluster size of 20. The classifier achieved 90.46 percent overall accuracy,
performing best in larger categories. External validation against Gravity
Projects Social Determinants of Health domains showed strong agreement
(Adjusted Rand Index 0.52, Normalized Mutual Information 0.78), indicating that
embeddings effectively capture cluster characteristics. This adaptable and
scalable approach offers a practical solution to CDE harmonization, improving
selection efficiency and supporting ongoing data interoperability.
